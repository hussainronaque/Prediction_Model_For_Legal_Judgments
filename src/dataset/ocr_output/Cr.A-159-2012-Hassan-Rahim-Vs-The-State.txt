the same case vide FIR No.314 dated
06.08.2011 under Sections 302/34 PPC P.S
Oghi, therefore, this single judgment/order shall
also. dispose of the connected criminal

appeal/revision.
2. The FIR was lodged on the report of
Anwar Zeb, complainant, whereby, he reported
to the Inspector SHO P.S, Oghi that he along
with his wife Mst. Akhtar-un-Nisa was asleep in
the Courtyard of their house whereas his
deceased son Wagar Ahmed and daughter-in-
law Mst. Rabia, convict/appellant, were asleep in
their room when at about 0200 hours at night his
daughter-in-law called them and told them about
the murder of their son Wagar Ahmed by some
one who entered their room and fired at the
deceased. In the room, they saw their son had
fallen victim to firing at his skull and already
expired as a result thereof. Even on their inquiry,
their daughter-in-law expressed her ignorance
about the culprit, though present and asleep in
the same room with the deceased, and simply
stated that at the time of going to steep the door
of the room was not closed. In his report, the
complainant stated that he or his deceased son
had no previous enmity, therefore, he charged

unknown accused for commission of the offence.
3. During investigation, the |.0 secured
blood through cotton from the double bed of the
deceased in the room where occurrence took
place, and also recovered a double barrel
shotgun 12 bore with three live rounds and an
empty stuck in the gun on the pointation of
convict/appellant Mst. Rabia from the cattle-shed
adjoining the house, after her arrest on
08.08.2011. The 1.0 prepared the site plan on
06.08.2011 and made addition of the place of

4. Immediately after her arrest on

08.08.2011, the convict/appellant, Mst Rabia, made a
confessional statement before the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Mansehra, wherein she disclosed her
relationship with convict/appellant Hassan Rahim and
their desire to get married to each other before her
marriage with the deceased and also marriage of
Hassan Rahim with another girl, and further her
committing Qatl-i-Amd of her deceased husband
Wagar Ahmed with double barrel shotgun after the
deceased refused to divorce her in accordance with
the prior plan of both the convicts/appellants to
secure divorce from the deceased and then marry
each other. The recovered double barrel shotgun, live
cartridges and crime empty were subjected to
examination by the fire-arms expert who furnished his
report in the affirmative. Likewise, the report of the
chemical examiner in respect of blood stained cotton and
blood stained garments of the deceased was in the
affirmative. After recording statements of the PWs and
completion of _ investigation, complete — challan
was submitted by the police/prosecution to the trial
Court against both the accused, leading to their trial
after framing of charge against them under Sections

302 PPC read with Section 34 PPC. During trial of

e Iqbal Khan SI/Oll (PW.13) procured

refused to confess his guilt.

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of both the accused were recorded
under Section 342 Cr.PC wherein they refuted
allegations of the prosecution, but declined to be
examined on oath under Section 340 (2) Cr.PC
or produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments of both sides, the learned trial
Court/ASJ-II, Mansehra, Camp Court Oghi, found
both the accused, Mst Rabia and Hassan Rahim,
guilty of the offence and convicted them under

Section 302 (b) PPC for the murder of deceased
Waqar Ahmed and_ sentenced them to
imprisonment for life and payment. of
compensation of Rs.100000/- each under
Section 544-A Cr.P.C, to be paid to the legal
heirs of deceased, if realized. The accused were,
however, extended benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C. The convicts/appellants filed criminal
appeals against their conviction and sentences
awarded to them, whereas the complainant
moved Criminal revision petition for
enhancement of punishment and awarding
sentence of death to both the accused.

6. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
convicts/appellants and learned Additional
Advocate General assisted by learned counsel
for the complainant heard, and record perused.

7. Admittedly, no ocular account was
furnished by the complainant in the FIR, as he
along with his wife was asleep in another room
while his deceased son was asleep in his room
along with his wife, Mst. Rabia, at 0200 hours on
06.08.2011, when the occurrence took place.

Mst. Rabia did not disclose actual facts to the
10

complainant before lodging the report though she
was present in the same room with the deceased
at the time of occurrence. The complainant or his
deceased son had no previous enmity to raise
suspicion of commission of the offence by some
one who was at loggerheads with them. It was
only after the arrest of convict/appellant, Mst
Rabia, that the actual facts came to the fore, as
not only the weapon of offence i.e. double barrel
shotgun with empty stuck in it and three live
cartridges were recovered from the cattle-shed
adjoining the house on her pointation, but she
also narrated true facts about motive for the
offence, and commission of the offence itself.
After Mst. Rabia revealed her relationship with
co-accused Hassan Rahim prior to her marriage
with the deceased and refusal of the deceased to
divorce her thus enabling her to get married with
the convict/appellant Hassan Rahim as motive
for the offence, the police also implicated him in
the case. She, however, nowhere, either in her
confessional statement or during trial, ever stated

that either Hassan Rahim was present and took
11

active part in the commission of offence or the
crime was committed by her at _ his
instigation/behest or with his help. She clearly
stated that it was only she who planed the
murder of her deceased husband and executed
the plan on 06.08.2011 at the relevant time when
she and the deceased were sleeping together in
their room. The weapon of offence i.e. double
barrel shotgun, which belonged to the deceased,
was also recovered by the police on her
pointation from the cattle-shed adjoining joint
house of the complainant and the deceased. As
such, there was no material, except confessional
statement of co-accused Mst. Rabia and
recovery of weapon of offence, that too,
connecting Mst. Rabia with the offence, to
warrant conviction of Hassan Rahim in the case.
Therefore, convict/ appellant Hassan Rahim is
acquitted of the charges. He is in jail and be
released from the prison if not required in any
other case.

8. So far role of convict/appellant Mst.

Rabia in the commission of offence of Qatl-i-Amd
12

of her deceased husband is concerned, it is
abundantly proved from her _ confessional
statement before the Judicial Magistrate on the
very day of her arrest in the case, without being
remanded to police custody for a single day. In
her confessional statement, she not only
disclosed motive for the offence but also Qalfl-i-
Amd of her deceased husband Wagar Ahmed
with double barrel shotgun belonging to the
deceased on the night of occurrence when she
was the only other person present with the
deceased in the room. Her confessional
statement is corroborated by recovery of the
weapon of offence with empty stuck in it from the
cattle-shed adjoining the house of the
complainant and the deceased on her pointation
to the police immediately after her arrest. The
learned defence counsel laid much stress on the
fact that there was no _ proof that the
convict/appellant was explained the necessary
pre-requisites in local language/mother tongue of
the accused to ensure that her confession was

voluntary, but the certificate appended with the
13

confessional statement would leave no doubt
that communication with the accused by the
learned Judicial Magistrate was through Saeed
Naeem Ahmed Shah, junior Scale Stenographer.
The learned defence counsel contended that the
prosecution should have produced the said
stenographer in order to lend credence to the
voluntary nature of the confession, but it may be
pointed out here that nowhere during the trial or
even in her statement under Section 342 Cr.PC,
the convict/appellant ever raised the plea that
she was not made to understand the nature and
consequences of her confessional statement, as
she simply stated ‘No’ when a specific question
about her confessional statement was put to her
during recording her statement under Section
342 Cr.P.C. The voluntarily nature of the
confessional statement is further substantiated
by the statement in Court during trial by Mr.
Shabbier Ahmed Durrani, Judicial Magistrate,
Abbottabad (PW.8), who remained consistent
about the voluntary nature of the confessional

statement, and no dent was created in his
14

testimony by the defence despite searching
cross examination on him. The P.M report
showing tattooing/charring marks on the ‘big’ fire-
arm wound sustained by the deceased on his
head tend to further support version of the
prosecution that the deceased was fired at from
a very close range with shotgun, obviously, by
some one in close proximity of the deceased in
the same room, who was none else than the
convict/appellant, Mst. Rabia, as established on
record. The case of the prosecution was further
augmented by recovery of shotgun used as
weapon of offence along with crime empty stuck
in it and three live cartridges on the pointation of
Mst. Rabia from the cattle-shed adjoining the
house where the occurrence took place. All these
facts, proved on record, remained un-rebutted on
the part of the defence which failed to advance a
version other than the one furnished by the
prosecution. There also appears no motive on
the part of complainant to falsely implicate Mst.
Rabia in the case as he proved to be a honest

witness, because he did not charge Mst. Rabia,
15

initially at the time of lodging the report; and
reported the facts on the basis of whatever story
was narrated to him by Mst. Rabia subsequently;
who was, incidentally, the only other person
present in the same room with the deceased at
the time of occurrence. Her answer ‘No’ to the
specific question with regard to her confessional
statement would, as such, not amount to
retraction of confession in the strict sense of the
word; which, indeed, received corroboration from
other incriminating evidence against her.
Therefore, there was overwhelming evidence to
warrant conviction of Mst. Rabia. Consequently,
her Jail Criminal Appeal No.01-A/2012 is
dismissed; and the impugned judgment of
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-ll,
Mansehra, Camp Court Oghi, dated 04.12.2012,
to the extent of her conviction under Section
302(b) PPC for committing Qati-i-Amd of her
deceased husband Wagar Ahmed and sentence
of imprisonment for life and compensation of

Rs.100000/- under Section 544-A Cr.PC, with
16

benefit of Section 382-B CrPC_ are
upheld/maintained.

9. As regards revision petition for
enhancement of sentence awarded to
convict/appellant Mst. Rabia, suffice it to say that
there appears no ground to interfere with the
finding of the learned trial Court with regard to
the quantum of sentence i.e. life imprisonment
awarded to the convict/appellant for Qat/-i-Amd
of her deceased husband on the basis of her
confessional statement and other circumstantial
evidence. The complainant was unable to show
ground for enhancement of the sentence to
death in the facts and circumstances of the case.
Consequently, the revision petition of the
complainant stands dismissed.

Announced.
