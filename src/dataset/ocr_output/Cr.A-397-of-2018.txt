Court by extending to them the benefit of doubt
against which the connected Cr.A No. 05-M/2019 has
been filed by Rozi Gul, father of deceased Zia-ul-Haq.
Both the appeals, emanating from the same judgment,
are decided through this single judgment.
2. S.H.O Usman Munir (PW-5) who is
complainant in this case, on receiving information

regarding dual murders in village Dunkacha, rushed

Toamuyess| ' os: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag brahim
‘ Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wiear Ahmad

to the place of occurrence in the company of police
escort where he found the dead body of young girl
inside a room of the Hujra of one Yaseen situated in
village Tiraj Dunkacha whereas the corpse of a
young boy was also lying at door of the room. Both
the dead bodies were laying in pool of blood. On
query, name of the girl became known as Mst.
Zarghna daughter of Yaseen Khan (father of the
present appellant and acquitted co-accused) and the
other deceased was identified as Zia-ul-Haq son of
Rozi Gul (PW-1) who had been done to death by the
present appellant on the pretext of honour. At that
time no one came forward to charge the appellant
due to fear. The IO prepared injury sheets and
inquest reports of both the deceased and sent the
dead bodies to Puran hospital for postmortem.

3. External postmortem of the dead body
of deceased Zia-ul-Haq aged about 20 years was
conducted by Dr. Rashid Ali M.O (PW-3). His
report in this regard is Ex.PW-3/1 which carries the
following opinion.

4. The Investigating Officer (PW-14) on
arrival to the spot prepared site plan, recovered
blood through cotton from the points of both the
deceased and four empty shells of 7.62 bore with
two spent bullets from the spot. He also recovered a
blood-stained mobile phone from the place of
deceased Mst. Zarghuna and secured mobile
recovered by S.H.O from deceased Zia-ul-Haq. The
present appellant was arrested on the same day i.e
08.05.2017 whereas his acquitted co-accused were
arrested on 10.05.2017. As per prosecution version,
the appellant led the LO to the fields from where the

crime weapon 7.62 bore rifle was recovered on his

fointation. He also recorded his confessional
statement Ex.PW-15/2 before the Judicial Magistrate
(PW-15) on 11.05.2017.

3 After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted before the trial Court. On
commencement of trial, the accused were formally
indicted for the offence to which they did not plead
guilty and opted to face the trial. The prosecution, in
order to further substantiate its case against the
appellant and his co-accused, produced as many as
sixteen PWs whereas ].0 Aslam Khan was re-
examined as APW-1 who exhibited F.S.L reports

!
regarding blood-stained garments of the deceased

ind crime weapon with empties as Ex.PK and Ex.PZ
respectively. When examined w/s 342,CrP.C, the
accused professed innocence whereas the present
appellant/convict also retracted his judicial
confession, however, they neither examined their
statements on oath in terms of section 340 (2),
Cr.P.C nor produced and witness in their defence.
On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court found
the appellant guilty of the charge, hence, sentenced
him to death on two counts with compensation vide
judgment dated 19.12.2018 whereas his co-accused

Afzal Rehman and Muhammad Waseem were

OB: Hon‘bte Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. justice Wiaar Ahmad
-7-
acquitted. Hence, this appeal with the connected
murder reference as well as the connected Cr.A
No. 05-M/2019 against acquittal of the co-accused.
6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned A.A.G.
on behalf of State and perused the record with their
able assistance.

vA Perusal of the record shows that the
occurrence is unseen because it took place at
unknown time during night of 08.05.2017 which was
reported at 05:00 A.M. The prosecution has mainly
relied on the confessional statement recorded by the

present appellant on 11.05.2017 before the Judicial

' Magistrate. We deem it appropriate to reproduce the

Tafarnu/Ps*

confessional statement for the sake of convenience.

8. The learned Judicial Magistrate
(PW-15) has endorsed certificate Ex.PW-15/3
wherein he has noted that statement of the appellant
was translated to him in Urdu. When appeared in the
witness box, the Judicial Magistrate stated in his
éxamination-in-chief that:

The accused made his statement in Pashto
language. The Reader of the Court namely
Najm-ul-Islam translated the same into Urdu to
me. I accordingly reduced the same into writing
through my own hand.

In cross-examination the Judicial

Magistrate admitted that he is Urdu speaking
whereas the appellant was Pashto speaking,

_ however, he did not ask him about his educational
background. He further admitted that he had not
administered oath to the Reader before utilizing his
services as a translator. The moot question before
this Court is whether confession of the appellant

t

.
tecorded in the above mentioned mode and manner

t

was authentic and reliable enough to provide a valid
\

foundation for conviction of the appellant on capital
charge. In this regard the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan in the case of Azeem Khan and another Vs,

Mujahid Khan and others reported as 2016 SCMR -

Teramuyes| : 0B: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshting brahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wiese Ahmad
-9-
274 has given-guideline for Courts before recording
confession of accused which is replicated below for

ready reference.

Keeping in view the High Court Rules, laying
down a binding procedure for taking required
precautions and observing the requirements of
the provision of section 364 read with section
164, Cr.P.C. by now it has become a trite law
that before recording confession and that too
- in crimes entailing capital punishment, the
Recording Magistrate has to essentially
observe all these mandatory precautions. The
fundamental logic behind the same is that, all
signs of fear inculcated by the Investigating
Agency in the mind of the accused are to be
shedded out and he is to be provided full
assurance that in case he is not guilty or is not
making a confession voluntarily then in that
case, he would not be handed over back to the
police. Thereafter, sufficient time for reflection
is to be given after the first warning is
administered. At the expiry of that time,
Recording Magistrate has to administer the
second warning and the accused shall be
assured that now he was in the safe hands, All
police officials whether in uniform or
otherwise, including Naib Court attached to
the Court must be kept outside the Court and
beyond the view of the accused. After
observing all these legal requirements if the
accused person is willing to confess, then all
required questions formulated by the High
Court Rules should be put to him and the
answers given, be recorded in the words
spoken by him. The statement_of accused be
recorded by the Magistrate with his own hand
and_in_case_ there _is_a genuine compelling
reason then, a special note is to be given that
the same was dictated to a responsible official
of the Court like Stenographer or Reader and
oath shall also be administered to_such official
that he would correctly type or write the true
on and_correct version, the accused stated and
: dictated by the Magistrate. In case, the

Tajamul/PS* OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’bte Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tapmuyest|

-10-

accused is illiterate, the confession he makes, if
i recorded in another language i.e. Urdu or
English then, after its completion, the same be
read-over and explained to him in the
language, the accused fully understand and
thereafter a certificate, as required under
section 364, Cr.P.C. with regard to these
proceedings be given by the Magistrate under
his seal and signatures and the accused shall
be sent to jail on judicial remand and during
this process at no occasion he shall be handed
over to any police official/officer whether he is
Naib Court wearing police uniform, or any
other police official/officer, because such
careless dispensation would considerably
diminish’ the voluntary nature of the
confession, made by the accused.

(Emphasis supplied)

9. Admittedly, both the Judicial Magistrate
and the present appellant did not know the languages
of each other and Reader of the Court had acted as
an interpreter/translator between them while
recording the confessional statement. The best and
legal course for the Judicial Magistrate in the
mentioned situation was to administer oath to the
Reader before recording confession for getting the
éatisfaction that what the Judicial Magistrate had
recorded in his handwriting was the actual utterance
of the appellant and was translated word by word by
the Reader without any alteration. Even the
prosecution has not produced the said Reader of the
Court as prosecution witness. While facing such

situation in the case of Mst. Bakht Saba and another

0B: Hon’ble Mr. fustice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘hie Mr Justice Wiaar Abmad
Tojemut/rss|

-ll-

Vs. The State through Additional Advocate-General

and another (2014 MLD 942 Peshawar), this Court
!
discarded the confessional statement of the accused

by observing that:

Secondly, the appellants were speaking Pashto
while the Magistrate, who recorded the
confession, was of Urdu speaking. Adil Mir,
Judicial Magistrate (PW-S) in the first line of
his cross-examination stated that he was not
understanding Pashto and requested learned
counsel for appellants to ask questions from
him in Urdu. He further stated that he had not
examined the accused to ascertain as to
whether they were maltreated or not. He
further stated in his cross-examination that
accused were not knowing Urdu while he was
not understanding Pashto; therefore, he
recorded the confessions through his Steno,
namely, Sheraz. He admitted that he has not
mentioned this fact in the confessional
statements. As there was complete disorder in
verbal communication between the Magistrate
concerned and the appellants and even the said
Sheraz has not been produced, therefore, it
cannot be said with certainty that the said
Magistrate satisfied himself regarding
voluntariness of the confessional statements.

The Judicial Magistrate has also not
clarified in his statement that in what manner he had
asked the questions mentioned in memorandum of
inquiry through his Reader and how he read over the
confession to appellant/convict, therefore, it cannot
be ascertained from the available record that the
appellant understood the nature and significance of

the questions put to him by Judicial Magistrate

De: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Wioar Ahmad
-12-
before recording his confession. Though the Judicial
Magistrate has stated that he had handed over the
appellant to Naib Court, however, the I.O has
admitted in his cross-examination that the appellant
was handed over to him at 13:00 hours. The relevant
portion of his statement is reproduced below:

I did not remember the exact time when the
accused was produced before the Court for
recording of confession, self-stated that I left with
the accused from PS at 0930 hours. The accused

was handed over to me after at 13:00 hours. The

other two accused were outside the court room
with me at that time.

Thus, neither the relevant procedure
was adopted in letter and spirit before recording the
confession nor the Judicial Magistrate has taken the
precautions for ascertaining that the appellant was
recording his true and voluntary statement u/s 364
read with section 164, Cr.P.C. Hence, the so-called
confession in the present case, being unreliable and
untrustworthy, is kept out of consideration in the

circumstances.

10. So far circumstantial evidence in the
present case is concerned, according to the site plan
Ex.PB, the place of occurrence is a Hujra, which, as
per prosecution version, is owned by Yaseen, father
of the appellant. Admittedly, Hujra in Pashtoon

customs and culture is a place commonly used for

Tefamuvrss|

oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Horrble Mr Justice Wigar Ahmad
uests and is seldom accessed by women folk. There
i no evidence on record that the Hujra was the sole
ownership of the present appellant rather there was
father and other brothers/acquitted co-accused of the
appellant who all shared the same building with the
appellant. Presence of the lady deceased with the
male at such like place having no boundary wall
pricks our mind and so is the question regarding the
sole alleged nexus of the present appellant with the
occurrence in the mentioned circumstances.
According to the alleged confession, a conspiracy
was hatched by appellant with his co-accused to
make surveillance of the paramour of their sister
who per prior information was approaching to their
house at that night, but it is astonishing that they did
not notice the departure of their sister Mst. Zarghuna
from the house to Hujra. Thereafter, according to
prosecution, deceased Zia-ul-Haq came to the Hujra
and entered a room alongwith Mst. Zarghuna but at
that time the accused, though on guard, did not take

I

any abrupt action and let the male deceased to jollify
|

with his sister inside the room of Hujra. Even the

appellant and co-accused Wasim, as per confession,

initially went to the said Hujra unarmed and when

found the door closed from inside, the appellant

Tajemuyes*|

ba: Hon‘bte Mr. tustice tshtiag brahim,
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmad
-14-

asked his brother to bring Kalashnikov and
thereafter he committed the murders. The mentioned
conduct of the accused as put forth by prosecution
does not fit in the given grave and stressed situation.
In the case of “Mst. Shamim and 2 others Vs. The
State and another” (2003 SCMR 1466) the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan, in view of the doubtful

status of the prosecution story, observed that:
'
“The prosecution story being the foundation
on which edifice of the prosecution case is
raised occupies a pivotal position in a criminal
case. It should, therefore, stand to reason and
must be natural, convincing and free from any
inherent improbability. It is neither safe to
believe a prosecution story which does not
meet these requirements nor a prosecution
case based on an improbable prosecution
story can sustain conviction”.

ud. As regards medical evidence, according
to post mortem report Ex.PW-3/1 prepared by
Dr. Rashid Ali (PW-3), deceased Zia-ul-Haq
sustained four entry wounds on his body i.e one
wound was of 01 cm in size, two wounds were of
0.5-1 cm and one wound was of 0.5 cm whereas the
dimension of the entry wounds on the body of
deceased Mst. Zarghuna have not been mentioned
by Lady Dr. Najma Begum (PW-11) in her

report. The wounds of different dimensions on the

TajamuyPs® |

oB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishttag Ibrahin:
Hon‘ble Mc Justice Wiaar Ahmad
Tajemul/PS*

-15-

body of deceased Zia-ul-Haq suggest the use of
different weapons which indicates involvement of
several persons in the occurrence. This aspect of the
case is in direct conflict with the confession wherein
the appellant has attributed the role of firing only to
himself It is also strange that both the deceased
have sustained eight entry wounds on their persons
but only four crime empties have been recovered
from the spot though the place of occurrence is a
plain area without any plants or bushes to escape the
sight of 1.0 from the remaining crime empties. The
mentioned fact is sufficient to create a reasonable
doubt in a prudent mind regarding the mode and
manner of the occurrence.

12. The record further shows that the four
crime empties recovered from the spot were sent to
FS.L alongwith the crime weapon after 62 days of
the occurrence. Prosecution has not explained with
heasons that why the crime weapon and empties

I
were not sent to F.S.L in time. This lethargic

|

conduct of 1.0 has vitiated the authenticity of F.S.L
report Ex.PZ. Reliance is placed on Jehangir Vs.
Nazar _Farid_and_ another (2002 SCMR 1986)

wherein it was held that:

DB; Hon‘ble Mr, lustice Ishtiag (brahim
Hooble Mr, Justice Winer Ahmad
Tafamul/P$*

-16-

Report of the Forensic Science Laboratory
whereby the three crime empties allegedly
found at the place of occurrence were found to
have been fired from a 7-MM rifle allegedly
recovered at the instance of Nazar Farid
accused was offered by the prosecution as a
piece of evidence corroborating the ocular
testimony. The occurrence had taken place on
21-1-1996. Nazar Farid accused was arrested
on 1-2-1996. The rifle in question had been
allegedly recovered from him on 12-2-1995
and it was at least seven days thereafter ie on
19-2-1996 that the crime empties in question

i had been received in the Forensic Science

Laboratory. In the circumstances this piece of
evidence is not credible and is of no assistance
to the prosecution as against Nazar Farid
accused.

As per prosecution version, the
appellant was arrested on 08.05.2017; he made
pointation of the place of occurrence on 10.05.2017
during which he led the J.O to the place where he
had concealed the crime weapon which was taken
into possession vide recovery memo Ex.PW-13/7.
Constable Sultan Ali (PW-13), who is marginal
witness of the recovery memos including the
aforesaid Ex.PW-13/7 regarding the recovery of
crime weapon and accompanied the I.O during spot
inspection, though claims to have witnessed the

recovery of crime weapon on pointation of the
{

appellant but made narrations in his cross-

be: Hon’ble Mr. fustice Ishtlag Ibrahim

examination which are self-contradictory. He stated

that:

We reached back to the PS at about 1100 or
1200 hours...... other than the day on
08.05.2017 I did not go to the spot again...........
the pointation of the spot was made by the
accused on the 3” day of his arrest...........The

' photographs were taken at Asar time. On
10.05.2017 we came to the Police Station at
about Maghrib prayer time.

This PW on the one hand admits his
visit to the spot only on 08.05.2017 but on the other
hand he asserts to be eye witness of recovery of
crime weapon which was allegedly effected on
10.05.2017. Likewise he has stated to have returned
to P.S with LO at 1100 hours or 1200 hours but
testifies the pointation by appellant, the photographs
whereof were taken at Asar time. In view of the
above statement of PW-13, the recovery of crime
weapon is not free from doubt. Since, various links
of the circumstantial evidence in the present case are
missing, therefore, the present appellant and their
co-accused cannot be convicted on such unreliable
circumstantial evidence. Wisdom is drawn from
Hashim Qasim and another Vs. The State (2017
SCMR 986) wherein the former view was re-

affirmed in the following words.

Taamuyrs|

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wing Ahmad
-18-

Keeping in view the above, the case of the
prosecution appears to have been based
entirely on circumstantial evidence. Placing
reliance on circumstantial evidence, in cases
involving capital punishment, the superior
Courts since long have laid down stringent
principles for accepting the same. It has been
the consistent view that such evidence must be
of the nature, where, all circumstances must
be so inter-linked, making out a single chain,
an unbroken one, where one end of the same
touches the dead body and the other the neck
of the accused. Any missing link in the chain
would destroy the whole and would render the
same unreliable for recording a conviction on
a capital charge.

13. Moving on to the connected Cr.A
No. 05-M/2019 against acquittal of co-accused Afzal
Rehman and Muhammad Wasim, the case against
them is purely based on circumstantial evidence
which has already been discarded by this Court,

therefore, the evidence on record to their extent does

hot need further appreciation.

14. In view of the above stated position of
the prosecution case, neither conviction and sentence
of the appellant could be sustained in the
sircumstances nor the same evidence can be relied
upon against his acquitted co-accused. Resultantly,
this appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment dated
19.12.2018 rendered by learned trial Court is set
aside and the appellant-convict Ali Rehman son of
Yasin is acquitted of the charge leveled against him

by prosecution. Murder Reference No. 24-M/2018 is

Tojamuys+| ‘ os: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘bie Mr Justice Wigar Ahmad
-19-

answered in negative. He be released forthwith from
jail if not required in any other case. The connected
Cr.A No. 05-M/2019, being bereft of merits, is

accordingly dismissed.

15. Before parting with this judgment, in
order to avoid complications of the like nature which
cropped up in the present case, we deem it
appropriate to direct that in future when an accused
is produced for recording his confession before a
Magistrate who is not conversant with the language
of the accused most particularly when the accused is
illiterate, the Magistrate shall send the case to
concerned Sessions Judge for entrusting the same to
another Magistrate who is well conversant and
understands the language of the confessing accused.
Office is directed to send copy of this judgment to
Additional Registrar (Judicial) of the principal seat
for circulation amongst all the learned Sessions
Judges/Judicial Magistrates with permission of the

Hon’ble Chief Justice.
