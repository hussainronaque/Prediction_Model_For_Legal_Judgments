SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellant Zalwanoor,
assailed the judgment dated 30.09.2021, passed by the learned
Sessions Judge, Karak, whereby he was convicted under section
302(b) P.P.C, and sentenced to Life imprisonment (25 years R.1)
as tazir, with fine of Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation to the legal
heirs of deceased within the meaning of section 544-A Cr.PC, or
in default whereof to further undergo six months SI. Benefit of
section 382 P.P.C was also extended to the appellant.

The accused/appellant Mubashir Parvez alias
Mubashir Noor has also challenged the same impugned
judgment, whereby he was convicted under section 324 P.P.C
and sentenced to five years RI with fine of Rs. 100000/- or in
default of payment of fine, to further undergo six months SI.

The complainant Nageebullah filed a Cr. R No.41-
B of 2021, as well as the state through Advocate General,

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa also filed Cr. R No. 02-B/2021, both
-2-

against the accused Zalwanoor and Mubashir Pervaz alias
Mubashir Noor for enhancement of sentence. As all the four
matters are outcome of one and the same judgment, so are
decided though this common judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case, as per contents of F.I.R are
that, on 21.07.2019 at 21:00 hours, the complainant Naqeebullah
along with dead-body of his brother Asadullah, in Civil
Hospital, Latamber reported the matter to the effect that he along
with his brothers Asadullah and Zahidullah came out from house
for offering Magrab prayers, his brother Asadullah was some
paces ahead, when they reached near the mosque, they saw
accused Zalwanoor and Mubashir Noor duly armed were already
present in the mosque. Reaching near the gate of mosque
accused Zalwanoor fired at Asadullah, as a result of which he
was hit and died at the spot, while necused Mubashir Nawaz
fired at them, but they luckily escaped unhurt. Accused after
commission of offence decamped from the spot. The occurrence
was witnessed by the complainant as well as Zahidullah. Motive
behind the occurrence was stated to be dispute over the property.
Noor Badshah scribed the report of complainant in shape of
Murasila Ex: PA/1 and sent the same to the Police Station
through constable Gul Jamal No.128 (PW-02), where Sajidullah
Moharrir (PW-01) incorporated the contents of murasila into
F.LR¢ Ex: PA) and copy of the same was handed over to
Rashidullah Khan SI (PW-13), who conducted investigation and

on completion of the same submitted complete challan against
-3-

the accused before the learned trial Court. Both the accused were
summoned and on their appearance, relevant copies were
delivered to them in compliance of provision under section 265-
C Cr.PC and thereafter formal charge was framed against them
on 20.10.2019, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. The prosecution in order to prove guilt of accused
produced and examined as many as 14 witnesses. On close of
prosecution evidence, statement of accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.PC, wherein they professed innocence, however,
they neither wished to produce evidence in defence, nor wished
to be examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.PC.
Learned trial court after hearing arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, vide impugned judgment dated 30.09.2021,
convicted and sentenced the accused. Both the accused filed
their separate appeals, while the complainant and the state have
moved their separate criminal revision petitions for enhancement
of the sentence. As all the four matters are the outcome of one
and the same F.I.R, so we are going to decide the same through
this common judgment.

3. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Asstt: Advocate General were heard at length and with their able
assistance the record was gone through.

4. The unfortunate incident claimed life of the
deceased and the matter was reported by the complainant, where
the convict/ appellants were charged for the death of the

deceased and ineffective firing upon the witnesses. Soon after
-4-

receiving firearm injuries the deceased was shifted to the KDA
hospital, Karak, where he was initially examined by the doctor,
and his death was confirmed. As the matter was related to the
Police Station Latamber, so the doctor, who examined the
deceased in KDA, hospital, Karak, referred the deceased for PM
examination to RHC, Latamber, where the matter was reported.
The scribe visited the hospital, took the report in shape of
Murasila and thereafter the injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared. After receiving copy of the F.I.R the IO visited the
spot and on pointation of the eye-witnesses, prepared the site-
plan. During spot inspection, the Investigating Officer collected
blood stained earth from the place of the deceased and two
empties of .30 bore from the places of the convict/appellants. It
is pertinent to mention, that the Investigating Officer also
captured the photographs of the premises and the same were
produced before the trial court during trial. The convict/
appellants were arrested after a day of the incident and from
personal possession of the convict/ appellant Zalwanoor a.30
bore pistol was taken into possession and the same was sent to
the Firearms Expert. After its analysis the laboratory concluded
that one out of the two empties, recovered from the spot,
matched with the pistol.

5. After arrest of the convict/ appellants they faced
trial and the learned trial Court, vide impugned judgment was
convinced regarding the involvement of the appellants in the

episode and as such they were convicted as stated above.
-5-

6. There is no denial of the fact that the appellants are
directly charged and that the prosecution examined as many as
14 witnesses in support of its claim and that after application of
judicial mind the learned trial Court convicted the appellant, but
this court is to see as to whether the prosecution succeeded in
bringing home guilt against the appellants and as to whether the
learned Judge was justified to convict the appellants on the basis
of collected evidence and recorded statements. In order to assess
the accuracy of the judgment and the authenticity of the
collected material and recorded statements, we feel it essential to
scan through record of the case and to reassess the evidence on
file, so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided.

7. This court is to see as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the appellants; as to
whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the
stated time; as to whether the witnesses were present on the spot
at the time of incident and at the time of report.

8. The unfortunate incidence occurred at the time
when the deceased and the eye-witnesses were on their way to
the local mosque to perform maghrib prayer and the moment
they reached in front of the mosque, the accused/ appellants
came out of the mosque, where the convict/ appellant Zalwanoor
fired at the deceased and the co-convict at the witnesses, who
luckily escaped unhurt. The complainant was examined as PW-
11, who stated that on the day of incident he along with the

deceased and the eye-witness left his house and on reaching to
-6-

the spot the accused/ appellants came out of the mosque, started
firing at them; that out of the fire shots made by the accused
Zalwanoor the deceased was hit, fell to the ground and died on
the spot; that the co-convict fired at them, but they escaped
unhurt; that soon after the incident the dead-body of the
deceased was shifted to KDA hospital, Karak, and on
confirmation of his death, the dead-body was referred to RHC,
Latamber, where the matter was reported.

9. The prosecution is to tell as to whether at the time
of incident the complainant and the eye-witness were available
with the deceased and that the incident occurred in the mode and
manner. In order to ascertain as to whether the incident occurred
in front of the mosque, we went through the site-plan prepared
by the Investigating Officer. From the spot blood stained earth
was collected along with two empties of .30 bore. We went
through the statement of the complainant and the eye-witness.
Both the witnesses were examined on material aspects of the
case and the witnesses remained consistent regarding the time
they left the house and regarding the time they were fired at. The
learned counsel for the appellants wanted to build up his case,
by submitting that the time of report and the time mentioned in
the Postmortem report find no support from the evidence on file.
As to him both the complainant and the eye-witness failed to
explain the exact time when they left their house and the exact
time when the deceased breathed his last. There is no denial of

the fact that the mosque, where the deceased and eye-witness
-7-

were to go, is situated near the house of the complainant and that
they in routine used to go to the mosque to perform their
prayers. The witnesses were asked time and again as to whether
they used to visit the mosque in routine, to which they replied in
affirmative with an explanation that when they were available in
village, they in routine used to go to the mosque together,
especially for performing maghrib prayer. The defence tried its
level best to discredit the witnesses on this particular point of
time, with an additional attempt to convince this court that the
presence of the witnesses at the place of incident, at the stated
time was per chance; and that the record is silent regarding their
coming together, in routine, to the mosque; and that the
witnesses made a conscious attempt to establish their presence
on the spot. It was argued that the unnatural conduct, displayed
by the witnesses, further deteriorated the prosecution case. The
record tells that the incident occurred in the holy month of
Ramzan and in this part of the country people available in
village do come to their houses to break the fast. It is not
unusual that after breaking fast the male (major) members of the
house do go to the mosque to perform maghrib prayer. The
witnesses remained consistent regarding the time the Azan was
called and their coming together after breaking fast to the
mosque, where they reached at 07:30 p.m. It was suggested time
and again to the witnesses that another mosque was situated near
their house and that instead visiting the same, why they selected

the mosque which was situated at considerable distance. The
-8-

witnesses replied consistently that as the mosque where the
incident occurred was their ancestral, so as a matter of right they
go to the same to pray. The defence articulated that while
reporting the matter the complainant disclosed that, the moment
they reached near the mosque the incident occurred, whereas in
his court statement he improved and disclosed that when they
reached near the mosque the accused/ appellants came out of the
mosque and started firing at them. It was highlighted that on one
hand the witnesses made dishonest improvement whereas on the
other when the accused / appellants were present inside the
mosque then how they came to know that the deceased and
witnesses have reached near the mosque and that in both the
eventualities the prosecution story does not appeal to a prudent
mind. We are not impressed with the picture drawn by the
defence, as at the time of spot pointation the witnesses pointed
out the initial places of the appellants inside the mosque and the
subsequent places, where from they fired at the deceased and
witnesses, outside the mosque. This is pertinent to mention that
out of the two the effective role of fire shot has been attributed
to the appellant Zalwanoor and that to his co-accused the
ineffective role of firing, so in all probabilities the accused/
appellant Zalwanoor is singularly charged for the death of the
deceased.

10. The presence of witnesses on the spot at the time
of occurrence and in the hospital, when the dead-body was

examined by the doctor, finds support from the fact that the
-9-

dead-body was received in KDA hospital, Karak, at 08:05 p.m.
the same finds mention in an OPD Chit collected from the
hospital and placed on record. After the death was confirmed the
concerned doctor referred the dead-body of the deceased to Civil
Hospital Latamber for onward proceedings. No sooner did the
dead-body arrive to the hospital, the scribe on receiving
information reached there, and the complainant reported the
matter. At the time of report besides the complainant PW
Zahidullah was also present in the hospital, who verified the
report of the complainant and also identified the dead-body
before the police at the time of report and before the doctor at
the time of post mortem examination. The witnesses explained
the manner in which the incident occurred, the dead-body
shifted and the matter was reported. In order to discredit the
witnesses, more particularly, on the point of time when the
deceased died, the death was confirmed, the post mortem was
conducted and the report was made, the learned counsel for the
appellants referred to the statements of all concerned i.e. the
scribe, to whom the matter was reported, the doctor who
confirmed the death of the deceased and the doctor who
conducted post mortem examination of the deceased. The scribe
was examined as PW-09, who stated that he was present in the
Police Station and was preparing for patrolling, when he got
information that a dead-body has been brought to Civil Hospital,
Latamber; that he along with other police party rushed to the

hospital and at about 21:00 hours, the complainant reported the
.

-10-

matter. The witness was asked regarding the arrival of the dead-
body to the hospital, who confirmed the same as 20:40/20:50
hours. He further disclosed that he reached to the hospital at
20:55 hours. The learned counsel for the appellant wanted to
convince that when the dead-body was received in the hospital
at 20:40/20:50 hours and that when the scribe reached to the
hospital at 20:55 hours, then why the matter was not reported
soon after his arrival, and that why the report was delayed till
09:25 p.m. In support of his claim the learned counsel invited
the attention of this court to the post mortem report where the
time between injury and death is mentioned as 20 to 30 minutes,
from death to post mortem examination as 2 to 4 hours, and to
the time of examination of the dead-body, which is mentioned as
21:30 hours. It was highlighted that when the matter was
reported at 09:25 p.m, then how the postmortem could be
conducted at 09:30 p.m, i.e. the time when the F.LR was not
chalked out. This limb of the argument of the learned counsel is
beyond understanding, as before conducting post mortem
examination the chalking of F.I.R is not the condition, rather the
legal requirement is the report of the incident which had already
been made. Once the matter is reported and inquest report is
prepared, then it is not obligatory for a doctor to wait for
registration of a case and as such no illegality was committed by
the doctor. The stress of defence on this particular aspect of the
case was only and only to convince this court that neither the

complainant was present on the spot at the time of incident and
-ll-

at the time of report, nor the eye-witness, and that the matter was
reported after the attendance of the witnesses was procured. To
assess as to whether this part of the argument has substance in it,
we once again revisited the statement of the doctor, who initially
confirmed the death of the deceased. The doctor was examined
as PW-10, who disclosed that the dead-body was received at
08:05 p.m. in KDA hospital, Karak, the same was entered in the
relevant register and after confirming the death it was he, who
referred the dead-body to Civil Hospital, Latamber for further
proceedings. The veracity of the witness was tested through
searching cross-examination, but nothing detrimental, to the
prosecution case, could be extracted from his mouth. There is no
denial of the fact that the complainant during the days of
incident was serving as constable in the police department and
was posted in Karak. An attempt was made to impress this court
that the complainant used his influence, and as such the
investigation was conducted to appease his appetite, but we are
not impressed with what was submitted at the bar. As on one
hand the record is silent, that the complainant has ever used his
influence, whereas on the other, the witnesses right from
beginning till the end remained consistent on material aspects of
the case.

In case titled, “Khalid Naseer and another Vs The

State and another” (2020 SCMR 1966) it is held that:

“Given the timeframe wherein the
deceased was initially medically

examined under a police docket and
-12-

recording of complaint Ex.PJ shortly
preceding therefrom do not support the
hypothesis of complainant's absence
from the scene; he has comfortably
Saced the cross-examination by sharing
all the relevant details compatible with
the salient features of the incident and
events collateral therewith.”

11. The defence invited the attention of this court to
the tampering made in the time between death and post mortem,
and also in the inquest report. The doctor who conducted
autopsy on the dead-body of the deceased was examined as PW-
10, who explained that as it was his first autopsy and that he was
deficient in experience, so he consulted his senior and it was on
his instructions that he calculated the time as such. On one hand
the doctor admitted the over writing which discloses his
bonafide whereas on the other he admitted his lack of experience
in this particular subject. The discrepancies in the time between
death and postmortem cannot be read either to favour the
prosecution or to discredit the defence, as the doctor confirmed
his inefficiency, so this piece of evidence cannot be read to
favour either side. If on one hand the defence wants to reap the
harvest of the manipulated time then on the other the
prosecution should not suffer for a mistake committed by an
incompetent person. When the doctor admitted that he was not
expert in the field, then the benefit of his statement can neither
be awarded to the appellants, nor that can be pressed into service

to discredit the prosecution.
-13-

12. The close relationship between the parties cannot
be overlooked, as the accused/ appellant happens to be the uncle
of the deceased, that when there was no blood feud between the
parties and the dispute was over a house, so in the attending
circumstances of the present case, we are not ready to accept
that the accused/ appellant was substituted for a real culprit, as
in the like circumstances substitution is a rare phenomenon.

In case titled “Arshad Beg Vs The State (2017
SCMR 1727), it is held that:

“Even otherwise this is a case of single
accused and substitution in such like
cases is a rare phenomenon as normally
kith and kin of the deceased (in this case
real brothers) would not implicate an
innocent person by letting off the real
culprits. Therefore, we hold that both the
witnesses of ocular account were present
at the spot and had witnessed the
occurrence.”

13. The medical evidence lends support to the case of
the prosecution, as the direction of injury is declared horizontal,
that too, on the chest of the deceased, so keeping in view the
place where the appellant was standing no ambiguity is left that
the same was possible from that position only. The time between
injury and death is another factor which supports the claim of
the complainant. As the accused is singularly charged for
effective fire shot and that one of the empty out of the two,
collected from the spot, matched with the recovered pistol and

the deceased received only one firearm injury, so the medical
-14-

evidence confirms the eye-witness account. There is no cavil to
the proposition that medical evidence is confirmatory in nature
and in presence of trustworthy and confidence inspiring eye-
witness account, it has a little role to play. As the witnesses fully
explained and established their presence on the spot and the
manner in which the incident occurred, so the same in itself is
sufficient to bring home guilt against the accused.

14. The Investigating Officer during spot inspection
collected one empty of .30 bore and on arrest of the appellant
Zalwanoor a .30 bore pistol was recovered from his personal
possession, the same were sent to the Firearms Expert,
wherefrom a report was received in positive. Though the
recovered articles were sent to the F.S.L on 30.07.2019, yet the
defence could not convince that the same was either planted or
fabricated. It was argued that when the empties were recovered
on 21.07.2019 and the pistol on 23.07.2019, why it took such a
long time, in reaching to the Laboratory. It was argued that the
delayed sending of the recovered articles is a circumstance
which favours the defence and that the prosecution could not
succeed in proving the safe custody of the recovered articles.
True that the recovered articles were sent and received to the
laboratory on 30.07.2019, but while scanning through the record
we came across a document duly exhibited as Ex: PW 13/13,
where apart from the blood stained earth, empties and pistol
collected in the instant case, other recoveries made in other cases

were also sent to the laboratory. As the Police Station is situated
-15-

in a remote area and as per routine when numerous cases are
registered, then for its own convenience the different collected
materials are sent to the laboratory on one and the same date,
and it happened in the instant case as well. Though we do not
approve this procedure, but from the document we could not
gather any mala fide on part of the prosecution and this lapse on
part of the investigating agency cannot be taken against the
prosecution. As the blood stained earth, blood stained garments
and the recovered pistol with two empties of .30 bore were
received to the laboratory on the same date, so it confirms that
the delay caused was not with a sinister design and even we are
not ready to accept that either the empties or the pistol was
planted against the appellant. As the positive laboratory report is
supportive in nature, in case the prosecution otherwise succeeds
in bringing home guilt against the accused charged then its
absence or otherwise is not detrimental to case of the
prosecution. As from the spot two empties were collected, where
one matched with the recovered pistol and the other did not, so
no ambiguity is left that in the incident more than one accused
participated and the laboratory report confirms the stance of the
complainant.

15. Motive alleged is the dispute over a house, it was
argued for defence that as motive was common to all the three
then what prompted the appellants to kill the youngest by
leaving the others. As the Investigating Officer placed on record

the copy of an F.I.R that was earlier registered between the
-16-

parties, where father of the deceased namely Sar Anjam, is
complainant and the deceased Asadullah the eye-witness. In
another document, which shows that the Jirga was convened
between the parties, where father of the deceased and the
deceased himself were signatory to the same, so earlier F.LR
registered between the parties and the arbitration/ Faisla Salsi
confirms that it was the deceased, out of his brothers, who
constantly participated with his father in matters against the
appellants and in such eventuality “we can gather that the
appellant was nourishing a grudge against him. In support of the
motive and arbitration between the parties, the prosecution
examined two witnesses one, a mason who during the days of
occurrence was constructing the disputed house, and who was
stopped by the appellant from work, the said mason has been
examined as PW-07, whereas in respect of arbitration between
the parties one Molve Ubaidullah was examined as PW-08, both
these witnesses appeared before the trial court and recorded their
statements. In view of the collected material in shape of an
earlier registered F.I.R, arbitration between the parties and the
witnesses who were examined in support of the motive, this
court lurks no doubt in mind that the prosecution fully

succeeded in establishing the motive.

16. As in the instant case the appellant Mubashir

Parvez alias Mubashir Noor has been convicted by the learned
trial Court for ineffective firing, upon the witnesses, so this

Court is to see as to whether the approach of the learned trial
-17-

Court on that particular aspect of the case was correct; as to
whether any recovery was effected from his personal possession
or from the spot to tell that he also made firing upon the
witnesses. We deem it essential to see from the record that in
case the prosecution could not succeed in establishing charges
against the appellant Mubashir Parvez, whether in that
eventuality the Maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus would
apply. For this particular purpose, we scanned through the
record to see the involvement of the appellant in the episode and
the role attributed to him. There is no denial of the fact that the
entire case revolves around the character of the principal
accused, whose fire shot proved fatal to the deceased, but the
role attributed to appellant Mubashir Parvez is only to the extent
of in effective firing upon the witnesses. This court is to
determine as to whether the learned trial judge was justified in
convicting the appellant or that the appellant was convicted only
with the apprehension that his acquittal would benefit the
principal accused. As the entire record is silent regarding the
interest of the appellant to kill the witnesses, as in case of firing
upon the witnesses, with the intention to kill, there was hardly an
occasion to survive, but the witnesses did not receive a single
firearm injury. We are confident in our mind that the role
attributed to the appellant is either to implicate him with the
principal accused for the reasons best known to witnesses or the
witnesses were nourishing a grudge against the appellant. True

that the set of witnesses, which once is disbelieved in respect of
-18-

one set of accused then its veracity is often looked into with
suspicion for placing reliance in respect of the other set of
accused, but the approach should not be mechanical, rather the
courts of law are under obligation to test the veracity of the
witnesses in respect of both set of accused, if the court reaches
to a conclusion that the deposition against one set of accused
does not appeal to a prudent mind then ipso facto the benefit
should not be extended to the other, as in that eventuality, the
courts of law are bound to look int» the role played by the
accused in whose respect the evidence is to be believed or to be
taken into consideration. As in this case, we have two sets of
accused, one to whom the effective role of firing was attributed
and the other to whom the ineffective. As the prosecution fully
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the principal accused
and that the witnesses remained consistent in respect of the role
played by the principal accused and also the circumstantial
evidence lend support to the testimony of the witnesses, as from
personal possession of the principal accused a .30 bore pistol
was taken into possession; and that the same matched with the
recovered empty from the spot. As the motive alleged is against
the principal accused; and that it was a grudge he was nourishing
in respect of the under-construction house, that he killed the
deceased, but the record is silent regarding the interest of the co-
accused and even nothing incriminating was recovered from his
personal possession. The Investigating Officer could not succeed

in bringing on record that the appellant Mubashir Pervez was
f

-19-

either sharing common intention or he had an individual interest
in killing the witnesses. True that the maxim Falsus in uno
Jalsus in omnibus, plays a vital role in criminal cases; and that it
has been made the basis for testing the overall veracity of the
witnesses against an accused charged, but it has never restrained
the courts of law from scrutinizing the deposition of witnesses in
respect of different accused charged with different roles. If the
veracity of the witnesses is out rightly rejected in respect of all
the accused charged, regardless of their individual roles, then in
those circumstances not only the prosecution, but the defence
would also suffer. In order to rescue both the sides from
irreparable loss, we deem it essential that the rule must be
applied with care and caution, as in criminal cases different
accused are charged with different roles, as is the case in hand, if
in the instant case the veracity of the witnesses is disbelieved
just because of their credence in respect of the accused, who is
charged for ineffective firing, then the same would not lead to an
automatic acquittal of the principal accused, who is not only
charged for effective firing, but also from his possession a .30
bore pistol was recovered which matched with the collected
empty, so much so, the motive has been proved against him, that
too, by producing independent witnesses in that respect,
otherwise the consequences would be far reaching and absurd.
In this particular case we deem it essential to apply the test of
accuracy independently, as in respect of the appellant Mubashir

Pervez apart from the testimony of the witnesses nothing
-20-

substantial was brought on record which could confirm the
statements of the witnesses in respect of the role, he played.
When the witnesses were at his mercy and when the appellant
was armed with a .30 bore pistol then there was hardly an
occasion for the witnesses to go unhurt, but the role of
ineffective firing is a circumstance that favours the appellant to a
greater extent. When such is the state of affairs, we lurk no
doubt in mind that the prosecution case is on weak footings qua
the involvement and participation of the appellant in the
incident. We are not persuaded that the appellant Muhasbir
Parvez was present on the spot duly armed to commit the murder
of the witnesses, but as the place of incident was common to all
then his presence at the place of occurrence can be taken in a
different manner. The record does not suggest that the appellant
was sharing his mind with the principal accused, when such is
the state of affairs then the role of both the accused/ appellants
must be tested individually. The learned trial Court was highly
swayed with the role played by the principal accused and the
charge against the appellant Mubashir Parvez, and as a matter of
extreme caution it decided to convict the appellant as well. Had
the trial court applied its judicial mind to the facts and
circumstances of the case, then it would have not hesitated in
convicting the principal accused and in acquitting the appellant.
We in the instant case feel it necessary to apply the test of
accuracy independently, as in that eventuality, we would be in a

better position to rescue both the sides from a greater loss.
-21-

In case titled, “Khalid Vs the State and another”

(2017 YLR Note 272), it is held that:

“Similarly, there is no rule having

universally applicable that where some
accused were not found guilty, other
accused would ipso facto stand
acquitted, rather it is the primary duty
of the Court to sift the grain from

chaff. “
17. The cumulative effect of hat has been stated

above, leads this court nowhere but to hold that the appellant
Zalwanoor is rightly held guilty for the offence and correctly
convicted and sentenced by the learned trial court, hence, the
impugned judgment to his extent is maintained and the instant
criminal appeal No.160-B of 2021, is dismissed, while the
learned trial judge fell into error while handing down the
impugned judgment in respect of the appellant Mubashir Parvez,
the same calls for interference, therefore, criminal appeal (Cr. A
No. 159-B of 2021) is allowed, conviction and sentence of
appellant Mubashir Parvez is set aside. He is acquitted of the
charges leveled against him. He shall be released from
confinement forthwith if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

18. Though the complainant/ respondent after feeling
dissatisfied from the impugned judgment approached this court
though Cr.R No.41-B of 2021, for enhancement of the sentence
awarded to the appellants, but as the prosecution could not

succeed in bringing home guilt against Mubashir Pervez and he

has been acquitted of the charges, so the criminal revision
against his sentence has lost its efficacy and the same is turned
down. So far, the case of principal accused is concerned, as the
dispute between parties was over a house, under construction
and that the deceased constantly contested his claim against the
principal accused on different forums, so his constant
confrontation with the principal accused turned to be a cause of
annoyance and as such the appellant Zalwalnoor was infuriated
to an extent that he killed the deceased, but the deceased
received a single firearm entry wound with no repetition of fire
shot, so both these factors, are the circumstances, which
restrained this court to enhance the conviction, as the awarded
sentence is not only fully justified but it also meets the ends of
justice. The instant criminal revision for enhancement of the
sentence is lacking substance and the same is dismissed as such.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short order

of the even date.
