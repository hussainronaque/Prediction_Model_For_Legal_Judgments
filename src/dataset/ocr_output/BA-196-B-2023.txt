FAZAL SUBHAN,_J.— Through this petition, the
petitioner Qudrat Ullah is seeking his post arrest bail in
case FIR No.160, dated 26.3.2023 under sections
302/324/148/149 PPC of Police Station Basia Khel,
District Bannu.

2. In the instant case complainant Arshad Gul son of
Hukum Gul while present with the dead body of his
father at D.H.Q Hospital Bannu, reported that on the
relevant day of occurrence he along with his father went
towards Qudrat Ullah son of Sana Ullah for the return of

goat purchased and return of their amount Rs.27500/- and
as a result altercation took place and Qudrat Ullah,
Shikayat Ullah and Inam Ullah sons of Sana Ullah, who
were duly armed with pistols attacked them and due to
the firing of Qudrat Ullah upon his father with the
intention to cause his death, he was hit and fell on the
ground while the other accused Shikayat Ullah and Inam
Ullah also made firing upon him (complainant) with the
intention to cause his death but he luckily escaped unhurt
and being empty handed he could not do anything. The
accused after commission of the offence decamped from
the spot and motive for the occurrence was described to
be amount of goat.

3. Onthe same day Qudrat Ullah son of Sana Ullah
at 11:05 hours also lodged a report in injured condition
at D.H.Q Hospital Bannu that on the relevant day of
occurrence i.e. 26.3.2023 they were present in their shop
when at 09:45 am. Naseem Gul son of Zakeem Khan,
Arshad son of Hukum Gul along with 4/5 unknown
persons came through rickshaw, out of which Hukum
Gul and two unknown persons were armed with knives
and attacked him whereas Arshad son of Hukrum Gul
made firing with his pistol and Naseem Gul was present
in the rickshaw and has aimed his repeater upon them.

As a result of their firing Hukum Gul was hit with the
firing of Arshad and at the same time he was also hit on
his heel while other companions of the accused also
attacked them with knives and bricks, whereafter the
accused left the spot. He also described the motive of
occurrence to be dispute over amount of goat.

4. ‘With this background of the case arguments of
learned counsel for petitioner and that of complainant
assisted by learned A.A.G were heard.

5. On tentative assessment of record it is clear that
the occurrence has taken place at 09:45 hours which was
promptly reported at D.H.Q Hospital Bannu at 10:45 a.m.
and in his report the complainant Arshad Gul has
specifically charged the petitioner Qudrat Ullah for
effective firing upon the deceased with the intention to
cause his death. During investigation two empties of .30
bore were recovered from the spot of present petitioner
and at the same time the medical evidence prima facie
supports the prosecution’s version. The petitioner has
also made a report to the local police on the same day of
occurrence and though it is a question for the trial Court
to decide as to whether the occurrence reported by the
petitioner has actually taken place and whether the same
can be taken as cross version, however, for the time being

his injury is on heel of foot and the same is reported to
the local police in D.H.Q Hospital Bannu at 11:45 hours
i.e. after the delay of one hour and 20 minutes. The
learned counsel for complainant also produced medical
report of the petitioner Qudrat Ullah and the nature of
injury is mentioned as blunt trauma. Learned counsel for
petitioner also produced the injury sheet prepared by the
concerned police officer, wherein he is shown to have
received three injuries, however, when the medico-legal
report is available before the Court which describes the
injury sustained by the petitioner to be with blunt weapon
then the story of firing by the complainant upon him
resulting injury to him and causing death of the deceased
Hukum Gul is not prima facie possible, hence there are
sufficient material on record to show that petitioner is
involved in an offence which falls within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr.P.C and it dis-entitles him for
the concession of bail at this stage. The august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Nasir Muhammad
has held that:-

“In these circumstances merely
because there are cross F.I.Rs. or
cross-cases against each other cannot
be a ground for grant of bail. Besides
this both the Courts below have
exercised their discretion and refused
to grant bail. The Supreme Court is
reluctant to interfere with such
discretion unless it is exercised
contrary to the principles laid down
by this Court, is in disregard of the
principles governing the
administration of criminal justice
and/or is perverse. Reference can
also be made to Hafiz Khuda Bux v.
The State PLD 1988 SC 413, Arbab
Ali v. Khamosi and others 1985
SCMR 195, Shahadat Ali v. Mubarak
Shah and another PLD 1986 SC 347,
and Mst. Bashiran Bibi v. Nisar
Ahmed Khan PLD 1990 SC 83. We,

therefore, dismiss the petition.”
Similarly, in case titled “Rashid Ramzan-Vs-The State

a, and_others” (2022 SCMR 2111), the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan has held that:-

“So far as the cross-version is
concerned, the learned High Court
has rightly noted that a bare perusal
of the cross-version reveals that
neither the petitioner is mentioned as
the one who was present at the place
of occurrence nor any claim of right
of private defence of person or
property has been made on behalf of
the petitioner, therefore, no benefit
can be extended to the petitioner. The
learned High Court by placing
reliance on the judgment of this
Court has rightly held that mere
existence of a cross-version could not
alone be considered a_ sufficient

ground to grant bail to an accused.”

6. Thus, in light of the available record and while
relying on the judgments of august Supreme Court of
Pakistan, it is held that mere lodging of cross F.I.R/cross
version is no ground for grant of bail to the petitioner
when he is otherwise found connected with the crime
falling within the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C, hence the petitioner is not found to be entitled for
grant of bail. Accordingly this petition is dismissed.

7. Before parting this judgment, it needs no emphasis
that prosecution is under statutory obligation to submit
challan in the case under section 173 Cr.P.C.
