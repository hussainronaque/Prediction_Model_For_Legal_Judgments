JUDGMENT

WIQAR AHMAD, J.- Petitioner is aggrieved of order
dated 08.07.2020 of learned trial Court, whereby his
‘request for framing of a single charge in the two cases
registered vide F.IL.R No. 751 dated 29.08.2016 under
sections 302/324/427/109/34 PPC at Police Station
Khal, District Dir Lower (hereinafter referred to as
‘FIR No, 751’) and F.I.R No. 752 dated 29.08.2016
“under sections 302/324/353/34 PPC & 7ATA at Police
Station Khal, District Dir Lower (hereinafter referred

. “ to as ‘FIR No. 752’), was declined.

2. FIR No. 751 was registered on the

complaint of Nek Dar Khan (respondent No. 1),
|

wherein he has stated that he along with his brother

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
2

namely Sohail Ahmad had been traveling in their
private motorcar on “29.08.2016. When they reached
the place of occurrence at 11:30 A.M, petitioner/
ecoused namely Eslam Wazir appeared along with two
other unknown persons from the bushes and suddenly
started indiscriminate firing upon them, as a result of
which his brother namely Sohail Ahmad received
injuries on different parts of his body and died on the
‘spot. Complainant remained unhurt, who has latter on
charged the petitioner along with two other unknown
laccused for commission of the offence, while two
other persons namely Anwar Khan and Imran had been
charged for abetting the commission of the main
‘offence. Two persons namely Liagat and Bakhtiar have

‘been cited as eye-witnesses of the occurrence in the
FIR also.

3 FIR No. 752 has been registered on the
‘basis of report of Abdul Rahman Khan SHO Police
‘Station Khal, District Dir Lower, who has stated
therein that he received information of commission of
the offence described in FIR No. 751, on 29.08.2016,
as well as the news about escape of the accused
through motorcar bearing No. 1570/PST towards
Rabat. Police Constables Fazal Wahab and

H
‘Muhammad Zubair had laid a picket for arrest of the

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-3-

accused for whose assistance and help, Aurangzeb ASI
along with Police Constables namely Nasib Shah,
Rahatullah and Mehmood Shah had also gone there.
Motorcar bearing registration No. 1570/PST appeared
suddenly and started firing upon the police party, the
moment they noticed them. As a result of firing of
accused party, Police Constables Fazal Wahab and
Muhammad Zubair received serious injuries and died
‘on the spot. Two other persons namely Huzaifa and
Hashtullah also got injured as a result of firing of
accused. The accused ran towards orchards at Rabat,
who were traced by Aurangzeb ASI, with the help of
inhabitants of the locality. One of the accused was
arrested, who disclosed his name as Eslam Wazir
son of Charra (petitioner herein), while the other

ico-accused succeeded in escaping from the scene.

4. Both the cases were submitted for trial
before the Anti-Terrorism Court-III at Timergara,
where charges were framed on 23.05.2017. After
framing of charges, four witnesses were examined in
case FIR No. 751, while one witness was examined in
case FIR No. 752. The Ant-Terrorism Court ordered
deletion of section 7 ATA from FIR No. 751, as well
as from FIR No. 752, vide its order dated 07.01.2020.

The cases were then sent to the Court of Sessions for

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-4.

trial. Thereafter, learned counsel appearing on behalf

‘of petitioner, filed an application for framing of a

‘single consolidated charge in the two cases on

20.03.2020. The application was dismissed by the

learned trial Court on 08.07.2020, with the following

remarks;

5. Learned counsel for petitioner argued the

‘case via video link and submitted that both the

offences have been committed in the course of one and
the same transaction and therefore a single charge

should have been framed in the two cases. Learned

! Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5.
counsel added that dictates of sections 234, 235 as well
as section 239 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898
(hereinafter referred to as ‘Cr. PC’) required that both
the cases should be tried jointly. He placed reliance on
the judgments reported as 1980 SCMR 402, 1992
SCMR 1583, PLD 2003 Supreme Court 891 and 1986

MLD 2477.

6. ' Learmed counsel appearing on behalf of
complainant/respondent No. 1 submitted that offences
in the two FIRs i.e. FIR No. 751 and FIR No. 752 have
been entirely independent of each other, wherein
charge could not be framed together. Learned counsel
also added that four number of witnesses have been
examined in FIR No. 751, while one witness has been
examined in FIR No. 752 and the request for joinder of
charge was a belated one. He placed reliance on the
judgments reported as 1973 SCMR 542, 1991 MLD

‘1973 and PLJ 2005 FSC 33.

z. Learned Asst:A.G appearing on behalf of
the State also opposed framing of a single charge in the
‘two cases and contended that it would create
phenomenal confusion, not only for the parties but also

for the prosecution witnesses, as well as the learned

‘trial Court. He added that one person has been killed in

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-6-
respect of which FIR No. 751 has been registered
while two constables have been murdered and other
two persons injured in respect of which FIR No. 752
has been registered and that both transactions were
totally independent from each other. He placed reliance
‘on the judgments reported as PLD 1964 (W.P) Lahore
339, PLD 1965 (W.P) Peshawar 65, 1973
PCr ib J 457, 2000 MLD 1504 and 2002 PCr LJ
8% I have heard arguments of learned counsel
‘for petitioner via video link, while arguments of
leamed counsel for complainant and learned Asst:A.G

‘were heard directly and perused the record.

9. Section 233 Cr. PC lays down the general
principle that for every distinct offence, of which any
person is accused, there shall be a separate charge, and
every such charge shall be tried separately. Exceptions
have also been mentioned therein, which are contained
; ‘in sections 234, 235, 236 and 239 Cr. PC. It is very
much clear that the general rule has been provided as
separate framing of charge for each independent
‘offence or offences, as well as its separate trial.
Exceptions have no doubt been provided in sections

234, 235, 236 and 239 Cr. PC, but same shall be

‘Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
I
-7-

construed as exceptions to the general rule and can
‘only be resorted to when a case is fully covered under
the four corners of exceptions provided therein.
Exceptions are therefore to be construed strictly as

held by Federal Shariat Court in the case of

Muhammad Arshad Naseem vs. The State reported
as 2004 P Cr. L J 371, Relevant part of observations of
the Hon'ble Court is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

“It may further be noted here that every
person accused of an offence or offences
is required to be charged distinctly and
separately for each and every offence
and though as per section 237, Cr.P.C. a
person charged with one offence can be
convicted for another yet, application
thereof is limited to the cases covered by
section 236, Cr.P.C. only. It would also
be worthwhile to mention here that
section 237, Cr.P.C. is an exception to
the general rule that, no person can be
convicted for an offence for which, he is
not charged, therefore, it must be
construed strictly and be applied in
those cases only where either the
offences allegedly committed are
cognate or it is doubtful as to what
offence is made out of the act or acts
allegedly committed by the accused.”

Section 234 Cr. PC is discretionary in

nature, which is evident from use of the word ‘may be,
and therefore same has been left to the discretion of the
Court, for the reason that the Court shall see whether

facts and circumstances of offences allows framing of

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-

a single charge. In the case of The State vs Mirza

Azam Beg, P.C.S. and another reported as PLD 1964
(W.P) Lahore 339, it has been held that it was not

obligatory on the Court to have joint trial of three
offences committed within the period of 12 months, as
such a power was discretionary in nature. Relevant part
of observations of the Hor‘ble Court is reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

“Section 234 Cr. P.C. is the first
exception to the general rule of one trial
for each distinct offence. The principle
underlying this section is that the
offences of the same kind in criminal
Court within a space of short period,
namely, twelve months from the first to
the last of such offences, may be tried
together. This section lays down three
limitations. They are, (1) that the
offences must be of the same kind, (2)
that they must have been committed
within the space of one year, and (3)
that more titan, three offence should not
be joined in the same trial. It is also
important to observe here that the
directions in regard to joinder of three
charges stated under section 234 are not
mandatory in the sense that it is not
: obligatory on the Magistrate not to try
the offences separately, but it is entirely
in the discretion of the, Magistrate
whether or not to resort to section 234,
The section is merely enabling section
and does not in any way deprive the
Court of ordering a separate trial. In
other words, it is not obligatory on the
Court to have joint trial of three
offences committed within the period of
12 months. It is also important to notice
that this section governs the case where
there is only one accused. The case of
several persons being accused of more
offences than one of the same kind
committed within the space of twelve
months is dealt with in section 239 (c).”

_ Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-

Similar view has also been expressed by
‘same High Court in its judgment given in the case of
Zia-ul-Haq vs. The State reported as 1973 P Cr. L J
457. In the case of Ghulam Faroog alias Ghulam
Qasim vs. The State reported as 2000 MLD 1504,
Hon'ble Balochistan High Court has held that where
‘prosecution decided to split charges and try accused
separately on those charges, accused could not insist
on joinder of charges. It is thus amply clear that such
power has been left to the discretion of the trial Court,
where its desirability may be seen in relevant facts of

‘the cases in which joinder of charges is sought.

(10. The provisions of sections 233 to
-240 Cr. PC, which deal with charges must also be dealt
together and should not be considered in isolation.
“They are supplemental to each other and not mutually
exclusive as held in the case of The State vs. Mirza
Azam Beg supra, relevant findings recorded in said
judgment are also reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

“This brings me to the one of the central
questions in the case, namely, whether
the exceptions contained in sections 234,
235, 236 and 239 are supplementary to |
each other or mutually exclusive.
Though there is no divergent of views on
this point, but the consensus of the
opinion is in favour of the view that
each of the four sections, namely,

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

sections 234, 235, 236 and 239 can
individually be relied upon as justifying
a joinder of charges in matter of trials,
but use cannot be made of two or more
of these four sections together to justify
a joinder. It is, therefore, not possible to
combine the provisions of two or more
sections or the different sub-clauses of
section 239 in any one case, or to justify
a trial of several persons partly by
applying the provisions of one clause
and partly by applying the provisions of
another clause or other clauses, and a
joint trial is permissible only if it is
permitted by any one of these sections.
Reference may be made to the decision
in Sri Rain Varma vy. State ((1956) All.
466). I may also quote the observation of
Chagla, C. J., in Dt. K. Chandra vy. State
((1952) Bom. 177 at 179) his Lordship
observed:

"It is not very helpful to consider

whether the exceptions contained in

sections 234, 235 and 236 are
mutually exclusive. It would be
better to lay down that if the
prosecution wishes to justify a trial
in which charges are joined, it is for
the prosecution strictly to establish
that the joinder is permissible under
either section 234, 235 or 236. It is a
well-known canon of construction
that exceptions must be strictly
construed, and unless the
prosecution satisfies the Court that
the exception has been strictly
complied with the joinder of charges
in a trial must be held to be contrary
law. It maybe possible in a
conceivable case for the prosecution
to establish that a case falls under
more than one exception. But if it
falls under more than one exception
it must so fall that it must not
infringe the provisions of any of the
three sections."

Again, while discussing the case of Bal
Gangadhar Tilak (10 Bom. L R 973),
His Lordship, observed :-

"We do not dispute the correctness
of the proposition laid down by the

‘Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-11-

learned Chief Justice that more than
one section mentioned in section 233
can be made use of in co-operation,
but the co-operation must not lead to
the contravention of any of the
sections mentioned in section 233."

A somewhat similar view has also been
recorded by Hon'ble Sindh High Court in its judgment

given in the case of Ramesh M. Udeshi vs. The State

reported as 2002 P Cr. L J 1712 in the following

‘words;

“Sections 233 to 240, Cr.P.C. deal with
joinder of charges and they must be
read together and not in isolation. When
the exceptions contained in sections 234,
235, 236 and 239 are read with the
general rule contained in section 233,
Cr.P.C., it appears that the object of
exception is to avoid the necessity of
same Witnesses giving the same evidence
two or three times in different trials and
to join in one trial those offences with
regard to which the evidence would
overlap.”

In light of the principles discussed
labove, I would now analyze arguments of learned
counsel for petitioner to see whether the learned trial
Court had wrongly exercised its discretion by not
treating the case falling in sections 234, 235 & 239
Cr. PC. Section 234 Cr. PC cannot be pressed in
service in the case in hand: Joinder of charges in
. offences carrying capital punishment at different places

‘and times can hardly be taken to be a reasonable

Abdu! Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
@ -12-
exercise of discretion vested in the Court by section
234 Cr. PC. It cannot be perceived that a person
committing an offence of murder of different persons
within a span of one year may be tried together. Such
an interpretation would obviously offend against the

general rule enshrined in section 233 Cr. PC.

11. So far as section 235 Cr. PC is concerned,
it provides that if in one series of acts so connected
together as to form the same transaction, more offences
than one are committed by same person, he may be
charged with, and tried at one trial for every such
offence. This section may be argued to be more
relevant for the present discourse, but it is equally
important to note that essential condition mentioned

herein has been;

a) If more offences than one are
committed by same person;

' b) In one series of acts so connected
together as to form the same
transaction.

Stories of the two FIRs reproduced
hereinabove show that the offences were independent
‘in nature and same could hardly be termed as forming
same transaction. The offences under sections 302 &
324 PPC in respect of which FIR No. 751 has been

registered stood completed at the spot. The accused left

t
' Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-13-

and while travelling in the motorcar noticed the police

party at a different place & time and made firing upon
them, in respect of which FIR No. 752 has been
registered, Except the factum of arrest of accused/
petitioner, and recovery of firearm (weapon of
offence), rest of the evidence of the two cases are not
common and has been independent from each other.
The two transactions cannot be called so connected
together as to form the same transaction. This Court
while giving its judgment in the case of Arshad Khan
ys. The Chairman National Accountability Bureau
NAB and _2 others reported as 2017 YLR 1111, has"

held that following test was normally employed by the
Courts for determining whether the series of acts were

so connected together to form one transaction;

“The test employed by the Courts for
determining whether separate offences
committed in course of the same
transaction is whether they are
connected together by (i) proximity of
time and place; (ii) community of
purpose and design and (iii) continuity
of action. The two last are essential
elements while the first is alone
insufficient for a joint trial.”

Said judgment has been given in a NAB
case, mostly involving allegations of financial
misappropriation in a series of transactions, but even if

we apply the test here, we do not find community of

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) ‘Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
-14-
purpose and design in the two offences, in respect of
which FIR No. 751 and FIR No. 752 have been
registered, nor has there been a continuity of action.
As stated earlier, action in respect of the offence
committed in FIR No. 751, ceased with fulfillment of
objective of the accused as stated therein, they may or
may not be knowing (what to talk of the intention),
whether they would be confronting the police party in
their way. Once they found the police party in their
way, at a different place and time, there a new
transaction started to happen, which has also been
completed there. Offences in the two cases can
therefore be safely held independent from each other
and not forming part of one series of acts so connected
together as to form the same transaction. Due to the
infervening time and totally different venues, the 2"
offence can hardly be termed to have been committed
in the course of hot pursuit. (Facts are referred in this
judgment, as alleged and same should not be taken as
findings of facts in any manner at this stage). Case of
petitioner is therefore not falling in sections 235 Cr. PC
also. So far section 239 Cr. PC is concerned, it
provides for the persons who may be charged jointly.
There is no question about the persons who may be put

to trial in the two cases. All the four accused can no

Abdul Sabooh/* | (S.B.) Hon*ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-
‘doubt be tried jointly but the provisions of law relating
to joint framing of charge and single trial, cannot be
pressed in service in peculiar facts and circumstances

of two cases, as explained above.

12, So far as judgments relied upon by
learned counsel for petitioner are concerned, same
have been returned on different set of facts by the
Horible Courts and the ratios laid down therein cannot

‘be applied to the instant case. In the case of Shah

Nawaz vs. The State reported as 1992 SCMR 1583,
Honble Supreme Court of Pakistan had been dealing
with a case, where a Senior Clerk/Cashier in
Government Science College Dokri, had been facing
trial for an offence of criminal breach of trust and
falsification of accounts. Similarly, in the case of

Nadir Shah ys. The State reported as 1980 SCMR

402, Hon'ble Court had been dealing with case of Nadir
Shah another Cashier in Bannu Woollen Mills, who
had also been charged with commission of the offence
of criminal breach of trust under section 408 PPC, with
regard to various amounts received by him during the
period of 29" June, 1959 to 8" February, 1963. Similar

‘were allegations in the. charge framed against

respondent in the case of State through Deputy

Prosecutor General Camp Office, Karachi vs.

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-16-
Ramesh M.__Udeshi, Ex-Secretary, Board of
Revenue (Land Utilization), Sindh and_ others

reported as PLD 2003 Supreme Court 891, where he
had been alleged to have disposed of public properties
in various transactions in a dishonest manner. Other
case relied upon by learned counsel for petitioner i.e.

Zahid _Ali_and 2 others vs. The State reported as

1986 MLD 2477 was also related to joinder of charges
against same persons committed similar offence of
violation of customs law. Similar was the case with
other judgment reported as 2017 YLR 1111, where the
matter had been arising out of various NAB references.
The law laid down therein cannot be applied to the
facts and circumstances of the present case, where
petitioners have been facing trial on charge of capital
punishment for committing murder against different
persons, at different times and places, with different
motives. Such amalgamation of charge would
‘complicate the matter not only for the prosecution
witnesses, but for the defence and the learned trial

Court as well.

13. Learned trial Court has exercised its
discretion in a matter, which had been falling in its
discretionary powers. Exercise of discretion by the

learned trial Court below, can neither be termed as

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
‘0, \\0

ia

-17-
illegal, perverse, arbitrary, nor resulting into any

injustice or prejudice to the accused. In such

circumstances, interference in order of the learned trial

- Court, by this Court as a Revisional forum is not

justified.

14. The instant criminal revision was

therefore found to have been lacking any substance and

Same is accordingly dismissed.
