Peshawar.

2. The case/FIR was lodged at 17:40
hours on 20.11.2011 in the casualty of LRH by
deceased Hassan Raza Khan (complainant),
then injured, to the effect that he along with
his father Ghulam Farooq and uncle Zikria
Hussain sons of Mehfooz Ilahi and Abdur
Rehman Farooqi son of Said Rehman were
present in street Nadar Ali near the shop of
the complainant situated in Mohallah Nawab
Deendar, Chowk Nasir Khan, Peshawar, at
16:30 hours on the eventful day, when, in the
meantime, Muhammad Hussain Hussaini son
of Kala Khan, Abdul Abbas alias Mohsin and
Askar Abbas sons of Muhammad Hussain
Hussaini residents of the same Mohallah
came duly armed with firearms and suddenly
opened fire at the complainant and his other
companions, resulting in firearm injury to the

complainant on his neck and left side back,
while his father Ghulam Farooq succumbed to
the injuries on his way to the hospital, and his
uncle Zikria Hussain and Abdur Rehman
Farooqi escaped unhurt. The motive for the
occurrence was cited as dispute over
property; and the occurrence was shown to
have been witnessed by the complainant and
his companions. According to the
complainant, he was brought to the hospital
for treatment by his uncle Zikria Hussain. In
his report, the complainant charged all the
three accused named in the FIR for causing
firearm injuries to him, death of his father
Ghulam Faroog and attempting at the lives of
his uncle Zikria Hussain and Abdur Rehman
Farooq by ineffectively firing at them. The
murasila, drafted by Khan Abbas S.| (PW-2),
was thumb impressed by the complainant and
signed by Zikria Hussain. It is noteworthy that
at the time of recording report of the
complainant an injured child namely Salma
daughter of Mifta-ud-Din aged about 10/11

years resident of Mohallah Nawab Deendar,
Chowk Nasir, was also brought to the hospital,
and the SI prepared injury sheets of both the
injured and referred them to the CMO, LRH
Peshawar. The S.| further recorded a note to
the effect that statement of the injured was
recorded in the presence of CMO on duty.

3. The medical examination of the
complainant, Hassan Raza Khan, by Doctor

Nasir Ali CMO, LRH (PW-10) showed that;

“Patient was conscious — having
firearm entry wound on the front of
the throat over the trachea and at the
upper end of the sternum. The size of
wound is half inch. Exit wound on the
back at left side just at the mid of the
medial border of the left scapula.
Patient was advised chest X-Ray and

4. Investigation in the case was entrusted
to Muhammad Riaz Khan SI (PW-14), who
proceeded to the spot, inspected the spot and
prepared site plan (EX.PB). During spot
inspection, the 1.0 secured blood from the
places assigned in the site plan to both the
deceased, Ghulam Faroog and Hassan Raza,
also recovered 11 empty shells in scattered
condition from point-B in the site plan, out of
which five empty shells were that of
Kalashnikov and the remaining six were of
different bores of pistols. The 1.0 also noticed
bullet marks in two groups at three feet height
from ground level on the western wall of the
General Store Shops of Zikria Hussain and
Hassan Raza and also recovered two
deformed spent bullets from the same place.
The IO also assigned point-E in the site plan

to the “disputed Sabeel”. The site plan was
prepared on the pointation of Zikria Hussain
and Abdur Rehman Farooqi. The blood
secured through cotton from two different
places assigned to both the deceased in the
site plan along with blood stained garments of
both the deceased were sent to the FSL,
Peshawar, for chemical analysis; and the
chemical examiner reported the same “was
human blood”. Likewise, the crime empties
and crime bullet recovered from the spot were
dispatched to the FSL, Peshawar, for
opinion/report of the Firearms Expert, who
found five crime empties of 7.62 MM bore,
three crime empties of 30 bore, three crime
empties of 9 MM bore, two crime bullets of 9
MM bore and one crime bullet of 30 bore.

5. The record would show that co-
accused Abdul Abbas died during his captivity
in Central Prison, Peshawar, in the
Government Lady Reading Hospital,
Peshawar, on 25.03.2015. Similarly, co-
accused Muhammad _ Hussain Hussaini

passed away in CMH, Rawalpindi on
08.09.2014 at the age of 73 years. Therefore,
proceedings against the late co-accused
Muhammad Hussain Hussaini stood abated
on 23.09.2014: while proceedings against late
co-accused Abdul Abbas stood abated on
28.03.2015. The appellant/accused, Askar
Abbas and late co-accused Muhammad
Hussain Hussaini were arrested on
01.12.2011, while the other late co-accused
Abdul Abbas remained at large, therefore, on
completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted against both the arrested
accused and, at the same time, challan under
section 512 Cr.P.C was submitted against the
absconding co-accused, Abdul Abbas, after
completion of proceedings against him under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. He was arrested
on 16.12.2011, and supplementary challan
was submitted against him to the learned trial
Court.

7. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of all the three accused, including
the appellant and two deceased co-accused,
were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.
They, while refuting allegations levelled
against them by the prosecution, declined to
be examined on oath or produce defence
evidence. Following arguments on behalf of
both the prosecution as well as the defence,
the leaned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Peshawar, rendered the impugned
judgment dated 25.04.2015, whereby, the only
surviving accused i.e. the appellant, out of
three accused named in the FIR, was

convicted under section 302 PPC and
sentenced to life imprisonment as Tazir on
two counts for the murder of complainant
Hassan Raza and deceased Ghulam Farooq
and also directed to pay Rs:200000/- each as
compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C to
the legal heirs of both the deceased, failing
which, to further six months S.I| on each
account. The accused/appellant was also
convicted under section 324 PPC, and
sentenced to 10 years R.I and fine of
Rs:50000/- and in default to further two
months S.l. The accused/appellant was
further convicted under section 337-F (iii) PPC
to three years R.| with fine/daman_ of
Rs:50000/-, “in the absence of any medical
expenditure etc, which shall be paid to the
injured and in default to undergo two months
simple imprisonment”. Benefit of section 382-
B CrP.C was extended to the
accused/appellant; and all the aforementioned
sentences were to run concurrently “as per
prevailing rules and regulations’; hence the

instant criminal appeal by the
convict/appellant and connected criminal
revision No.60-P/2015 by Zikria Hussain for
enhancement of the sentence of life
imprisonment awarded to the appellant under

section 302 (b) PPC.

8. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict/appellant and learned AAG, assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant party
heard; and record perused.

9. The unique characteristics of this case
are that a father and his two sons were
charged for causing fatal injuries to the
deceased/complainant, Hassan Raza Khan,
then injured, and his deceased father Ghulam
Farooq, who reportedly succumbed to the
firearm injuries on his way to the hospital, and
another female child namely Mst. Salma
daughter of Miftah-ud-Din aged about 10/11
years also sustained injury during the
occurrence. The accused father, namely,
Muhammad Hussain Hussaini passed away
before conclusion of the trial and likewise his

son and co-accused Abdul Abbas also died
before conclusion of trial, leaving behind the
appellant to see the culmination of trial and
face conviction and sentences awarded to him
by the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Peshawar, vide impugned judgment
dated 25.04.02015. However, both the
eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR, namely,
Zikria Hussain and Abdur Rehman Faroogi
escaped unhurt, and did not receive a single
injury in the alleged indiscriminate firing by
three persons, a father and his two sons, with
their deadly weapons, despite the fact that
PW Zikria Hussain was brother of deceased
Ghulam Farooq and, as such, uncle of
deceased complainant, Hassan Raza, and
motive for the occurrence was cited as dispute
over property between the two parties i.e.
complainant and accused.

10. The main thrust of arguments on both
sides i.e. defence and prosecution, was with
regard to the so-called ‘dying declaration’ of
deceased-complainant, Hassan Raza Khan,

who was brought to the casualty in LRH
Hospital, Peshawar, in injured condition and
there his report was recorded in the shape of
murasila. However, his report, carrying his
thumb impression, was verified by his uncle
and PW Zikria Hussain, who signed the same,
instead of CMO LRH (PW-10), who simply
recorded his endorsement on top of the
murasila, without recording time under his
endorsement or name of the patient, his
parentage and address; and without furnishing
a separate certificate regarding the fact that
the injured was able to talk coherently. He
voluntarily admitted in his statement before
the Court that the details of time, name of the
patient, his parentage and address had been
mentioned by the police on the murasila
already written by the police, and that he
had given his endorsement. It may also be
mentioned here that PW-10 only showed the
patient conscious, without reporting about his
faculty of speaking, and whether the injured
complainant was well oriented at the time of

recording his report. These glaring omissions
on the part of the medical officer assume
importance in the face of firearm injuries
sustained by the complainant on the front of
the throat over the trachea and at the upper
end of the sternum, having size of half inch
and corresponding exit wound on the back at
left side just at the mid of the medial border of
the left scapula. The medical officer also
omitted to mention regarding the airway,
breathing, circulation of blood, disability, blood
pressure, pulse rate, colour of face, condition
of the eye-balls, how the patient was reacting
at that time and the manner of his speech and
the pitch of the voice specifically. It may also
be pointed out here that according to the
medical officer the missile was from up to
downward. He agreed with the suggestion that
the bullet, having caused entry and exit
wounds, could injure walls, ribs, cartilages, left
lung, vertebral column, blood vessels, Irynx,
trachea and esophagus and that it was
possible that due to intensive internal bleeding

there would have been pressure on vital
20

internal organs of the injured and further that if
vertebral column was injured the patient would
suffer paraplegia and that due to loss of blood,
the patient could go into shock and comma. It
was also admitted as correct that Irynx was
the organs of voice and vocal cord are also
situated in front of it and that Irynx was
situated in front of pharynx and at the upper
end of the trachea. The medical officer
admitted as correct the suggestion that if
trachea was choked due to foreign body or
blood there would be severe cough and if it is
choked at the lower end the patient will be
having breathing difficulty. The graphic details
furnished by the injured complainant about the
occurrence, including the information about
his father succumbing to the injuries on his
way to the hospital, tend to raise serious
questions about the authenticity of the so-
called ‘dying declaration’. In short, the
statement of PW-10 i.e. the medical officer,
who examined the complainant in injured

condition, and all the aforementioned
21

admissions on his part, raised too serious
doubts about the FIR to be treated as a ‘dying
declaration’, more-so, when the
report/murasila was thumb impressed by
complainant, Hassan Raza, unlike rider of the
murasila and uncle of the deceased-
complainant, namely, Zikria Hussain who
signed the report, without any evidence to the
effect that the deceased complainant was
illiterate and could’ not_ sign; and,
notwithstanding the words“ ”
indicating the report also by Zikria Hussain
and not as ‘dying declaration’ only by the
complainant.

11. Apart from the fact that both the so-
called eyewitnesses did not receive even a
single scratch during the _ reported
indiscriminate firing by three persons, while
they were also in the firing range and not only
both the deceased had received firearm
injuries but the child namely Mst. Salma also
sustained firearm injuries, Zikria Hussain is,

admittedly, brother of deceased Ghulam
22

Farooq, therefore, a highly interested witness,
and the other witness, namely, Abdur Rehman
Faroogi, already booked under sections 420
and 468 PPC for committing cheating and
forgery, hence his credibility and veracity of
his statement under serious doubt. Although
not a marginal witness to the recovery memos
pertaining to blood secured from the spot and
also empties and some bullets recovered from
the spot by the |.0, yet showing his presence
at the time of the said recoveries by the 1.0,
would also expose him as not a truthful
witness and worthy of reliance. He claimed
that his hands and clothes were stained with
blood and that in the same clothes he
accompanied the injured and Zikria Hussain to
the hospital; but neither blood stains were
noticed on his hands nor his blood stained
clothes were taken into possession by the |.O,
thus falsifying his assertion in this regard. In
the same manner, Zikria Hussain (PW-12)
claimed that his hands and clothes were

stained with blood while picking the deceased
23

from the ground, but even on his hands and
clothes no blood stains were noticed, neither
his blood stained clothes were taken into
possession by the I.O.

12. In the FIR, dispute over property was
mentioned as motive for the occurrence, but
neither a single document was placed on
record of the case in support of the motive
alleged by the injured complainant in his so-
called ‘dying declaration’; nor anything was
brought with regard to dispute over Sabeel
introduced, later, in the case by the |.O. The
statement of Abdur Rehman (PW-13)
regarding dispute between the parties
pertaining to the water tank situated near the
shop of the complainant also remained
unsubstantiated. The motive, as such, all
along remained shrouded in mystery, hence
created space for doubting version of the

prosecution.

13. The prosecution failed to produce
injured female child, Mst. Salma, and

abandoned her “being minor’, without any
24

observation by the learned trial Court
regarding her inability to record statement due
to her minority; and her father Miftah-ud-Din
was also abandoned, thus withholding the
best available witnesses, casting shadow of
doubt on the case of the prosecution.

14. In the FIR, all the three accused
mentioned therein were shown armed with
“ ” without specification of the
weapons of offence with which the father and
his two sons were armed i.e. weapons of 7.62
bore, 30 bore and 9MM bore. However, later
in their statements before the Court the
factum of the accused/appellant armed with
Kalashnikov was introduced by way of
improvement, without anything forthcoming on
the record that both the deceased and the
injured female child sustained injuries due to
firing from the Kalashnikov shown in
possession of the accused/appellant at the
time of occurrence. Neither the Kalashnikov
has been recovered as weapon of offence

from the accused/appellant, nor he has made
25

any confession in this respect so as to
connect him with the commission of the
offence.

15. Having scanned the record, comprising
evidence of the prosecution, with valuable
assistance of learned counsel for the parties,
we have no second opinion that both the so-
called ‘dying declaration’ and presence of the
so-called eyewitnesses are bereft of
supporting evidence, receiving corroboration
from rest of the evidence adduced in the case
by the prosecution. In the circumstances,
there was no evidence worth reliance before
the learned trial Court to render judgment of
conviction of the appellant/ accused and
award him the sentence of life imprisonment.
16. The appeal of the convict/appellant is,
therefore, accepted; and the conviction of the
appellant as well as sentences awarded to
him by the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge-V, Peshawar, dated
25.04.2015, are set aside. The appellant is

acquitted of the charges levelled against him;
26

and be set free, forthwith, if not required in
any other case.

17. Since appeal of the convict/appellant
has been accepted and his conviction and
sentences awarded to him set aside, resulting
in his acquittal in the case, the criminal
revision No.60-P/2015 by Zikria Hussain,

having become infructuous, is dismissed,

accordingly.
