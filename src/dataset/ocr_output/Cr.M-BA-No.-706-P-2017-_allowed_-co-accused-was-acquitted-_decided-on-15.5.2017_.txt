JUDGMENT

Date of hearing. 15.5.2017

Petitioners: (Nawas Khan) by Barrister M. Zahoorul Haq,

Respondents:

Advocate.

AAG & Maqsood Anwar Aziz, Advocate.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.-_ Petitioner, Nawas Khan

son of Abdur Rahim, seeks bail in case FIR No. 868 dated

30.8.2009 under Sections 302/324/34 PPC registered at

Police Station City Mardan. He has been refused bail by the

learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Mardan vide order

dated 28.2.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same

purpose.

2. On 30.8.2009, Azizullah complainant lodged a

report to the effect that there was a quarrel in the house of

accused-petitioner etc, who is his neighbours, and for the

purpose of pacification, he went to his house and when

returned to his house, the accused-petitioner along with

Arif (acquitted accused) armed with firearms came and

(The State and another) by M/s Mian Arshad Jan
made firing at him, as a result of which, he and his relative

Sultan got hit and injured. The occurrence was witnessed

by injured Sultan and people present there. Subsequently,

the relative of complainant Sultan succumbed to his injuries

and Section 302 PPC was added in the F.I.R.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of the record reveals that no specific

role of firing has been attributed to any of the accused.

Petitioner’s co-accused Arif, after his arrest, was put on

trial and acquitted of the charge vide judgment dated

26.6.2014. Except for abscondence, the learned counsel for

the complainant could not point out any additional evidence

against the petitioner, which could prima facie distinguish

his case with that of the acquitted co-accused. The Court,

while considering the petitioner’s plea of bail, could not

ignore the acquittal of co-accused vis-a-vis the merits of his

case. In the case of Jam Sadiq Ali vs State (DB) (1989

P.Cr.L.J 1910) even bail before arrest of the accused was

confirmed on the sole ground that his co-accused in murder

charge was acquitted. The Karachi High Court in Nawab
Ali vs State (DB) (2003 YLR 113) has observed that the

case of accused was identical to the case of co-accused,

who had been acquitted on similar charge and _ his

abscondence could not be treated as a bar to his release on

bail. The same view was reiterated in Muhammad Iqbal

Solangi vs State (DB) (PLD 2004 Kar. 377). Therefore, in

view of the above, the petitioner’s plea of bail cannot be

thrown at the threshold on the sole ground of abscondance.

The rule that fugitive from law is no ground to decline the

bail, if the case of an accused is otherwise found fit for bail

on merits and the bail cannot be refused even if he had

remained an absconder because abscondance by itself is not

a pointer towards the guilt of an accused. Reliance can be

placed on the cases of State v. Malik Mukhtiar Ahmed

(1991 SCMR 322) and Mitho Pitafi_ versus The State

(2009 SCMR 299).

5. Resultantly, this bail application is accepted

and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided he

furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four

lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall

ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of

means.

6. Above are the reasons of my short order of

even date.

Announced.
