Appellant-Petitioner

Respondent

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.--- Accused/ petitioners seek their

release on bail in case F.I.R No. 537 dated 24.12.2016 under

section 302/324/148/149 P.P.C, Police Station Nawanshehr,

Abbottabad.

2. The brief and relevant facts leading to the present

petition are that Amanullah Khan (complainant) in injured

condition accompanying the injured PWs Ehsan Ullah, Atta

Ullah, Haji Ghulam Khan and dead bodies of Shahid Faheem

and a passerby as well as injured Munsif Khan and an unknown
-2-

injured lady, reported the matter to the local police in

Emergency room of ATH Abbottabad against the present

accused /petitioners and co-accused to the effect that his father

Haji Ghulam Khan and brother Attaullah were going towards

mosque for offering Isha Prayers. At about 07.00 PM Faisal

Khan came in Jeep and upon seeing the father and brother of

the complainant took turns with speed and started altercation

with the father of the complainant. On hearing hue and cry,

complainant also rushed towards his father. Meanwhile Shahid

Faheem Khan and Habib Ullah Khan also reached at the spot.

Sohrab Khan, Sajawal Khan, Murad Khan, Babar Khan, Safdar

Khan alongwith 4/5 unknown persons armed with firearms

came to the spot. On seeing them, Faisal Khan also took out his

firearm and they all started indiscriminate firing on the

complainant party as a result of which complainant sustained

injury on this left shoulder, while his father Ghulam Khan,

brothers Ehsanullah, Atta Ullah, brother in law Shahid Faheem,

an unknown male passerby, a female passerby and one Munsif

Khan passerby sustained firearm injuries on different parts of

their bodies. Shahid Faheem Khan alongwith one passerby
-3-

succumbed to injuries at ATH Abbotabad. Occurrence was

stated to have been witnessed by complainant, his brother

Ehsanullah, Habibullah Khan, Saifullah Khan, passerby persons

and other people present at the spot. Motive for the occurrence

was stated to be the previous altercation between Attaullah and

Safdar on crossing of vehicle. On the basis of this report,

present FIR was registered.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of the record reveals that regarding the

same occurrence another F.I.R No. 538/2016 was registered by

accused/ petitioner Sohrab Khan against the complainant party,

for attempting at the lives of accused/ petitioner and others,

wherein five persons including passerby sustained severe

injuries on vital parts of their bodies. The time of occurrence in

both the case FIRs is almost same, while place of occurrence

and the parties are the same. It is a case of two versions arising

from the same incident, which version is correct, is to be

decided by the trial after recording evidence. By now it is

settled that in such cases bail is to be granted on the ground of

further inquiry, as it gives arise to a question, as to which party
-4-

is aggressor and which party is aggressed upon. Reliance is

placed on case titled “Shoaib Mehmood Butt Vs Iftikhar-ul-

Hag and 3 others (1996 SCMR 1845), wherein it is held that:

16. In case of counter-versions arising
from the same incident, one given by
complainant in FIR. and the other given
by the opposite-party case-law is almost
settled that such cases are covered for
grant of bail on the ground of further
enquiry as contemplated under section
497(2), Cr.P.C. In such cases normally,
bail is granted on the ground of further
enquiry for the reason that the question as
to which version is correct is to be decided
by the trial Court which is supposed to
record evidence and also appraise the same
in order to come to a final conclusion in
this regard. In cases of counter-versions,
normally, plea of private defence is taken
giving rise to question as to which party is
aggressor and which party is aggressed. In
the case of Fazal Muhammad v. Ali Ahmad
(19)0 SCMR 391) in cross-cases the High
Court granted bail to the accused on the
ground that there was probability of
counter-version being true as some of the
accused had received injuries including a
grievous injury on the head of one accused.
It was held by this Court that in such
circumstances the High Court was right in

granting bail and no interference was
-5-

warranted, In the same context, reference
can be made to the case of Mst. Shafigan v.
Hashim Ali and others (1972 SCMR 682).

5. Perusal of both the FIRs reveal that complainant
of both the cases remained mute regarding damage caused to
the other side and prima facie they have suppressed the real
facts, which factum makes the case of accused/ petitioners
one of further inquiry. Reliance is placed on case titled,

“Muhammad Zahid Umer Vs The State and another” (2016

SCMR 1246), wherein it has been held that:

“Prima facie, both the parties have given
their own version qua the manner in which
this incident took place. Chances of
suppression of real facts by both the parties

cannot be ruled out.”

6. Moreover, one party disclosed the factum of
indiscriminate firing, while the other party attributed the role
of firing to each accused. In the fateful incident, three persons
have lost their lives, while others from both the sides have
received injuries. At this stage, on tentative assessment of the
record, doubt exists that by which accused the injuries have

been caused to the injured as well deceased, in both the case
-6-
FIRs. In such a situation, the accused/ petitioners are found
entitled for the concession of bail. Reliance is placed on case
titled “Ali_Sheheryar_Vs_the State(2008 SCMR_ 1448
wherein it is held that:
“However, on tentative assessment of the
material on record for the purpose of grant
or refusal of bail in murder case of cross-
version, if some doubt is created about the
injuries caused to the deceased as to who
was responsible for the same, which of
course, has to be determined by the trial
Court on minute appreciation of entire
evidence, the provisions of section 497,
Cr.P.C. would be attracted and benefit of

such doubt would be extended to the

accused even at bail stage.”

7. It is also borne out from the record that all the

accused in case FIR No.538 have been admitted to bail by the

learned lower Court vide orders 07.02.2017 and 28.01.2017. It

is settled principle of law that if one party is granted bail, the

other party would also be entitled to the same relief in case of

counter version. Reliance is placed on case titled, “Muhammad

Shahzad Saddiqui, Vs The state and another” (PLD 2009 SC

58), wherein it is held that:
-7-

It is settled principle of law that if one party
is granted bail, other party is also entitled
to the same relief in case of counter-
version. We may profitably quote the
following observations made by this Court
in Shoaib Mehmood Butt v. Iftikhar-ul-
Haq and 3 others, (1996 SCMR 1845):--

"In case of counter-versions
arising from the same incident,
one given by complainant in
F.LR and the other given by the
opposite party case law is almost
settled that such cases are
covered for grant of bail on the
ground of further inquiry as
contemplated under _ section
497(2), Cr.P.C. In such cases
normally, bail is granted on the
ground of further enquiry for the
reasons that the question as to
which version is correct is to be
decided by the trial Court which
is supposed to record evidence
and also appraise the same in
order to come to a_ final
conclusion in this regard. In
cases of —_ counter-versions,
normally, plea of private defence
is taken giving rise to question as
to which party is aggressor and
which party is aggressed. In the

case of Fazal Muhammad y. Ali
-8-

Ahmad (1976 SCMR 391) in
cross-cases_ the High Court
granted bail to the accused on
the ground that there’ was
probability of counter version
being true as some of the
accused had received injuries
including a grievous injury on
the head of one accused. It was
held by this Court that in such
circumstances the High Court
was right in granting bail and no
interference was warranted. In
the same context, reference can
be made to the case of Mst.
Shafiqan v. Hashim Ali and
others (1972 SCMR 682)."

8. The accused cannot be kept in jail as punishment

merely on the ground that they are directly charged for an

offence falling under the prohibitory clause of section 497

Cr.PC, because a mistaken relief of bail may be repaired by

convicting the accused, if proved guilty, but no proper

reparation can be offered for their unjustified incarceration,

albeit, their acquittal in the long run. Reliance is placed on case

titled “Zaigham Ashraf Vs the State and others’ (2016 SCMR

18),wherein it is held that:
-9.

“9. To curtail the liberty of a person is a
serious step in law, therefore, the Judges
shall apply judicial mind with deep thought
for reaching at a fair and_ proper
conclusion albeit tentatively however, this
exercise Shall not to be carried out in
vacuum or in a flimsy and casual manner
as that will defeat the ends of justice
because if the accused charged, is
ultimately acquitted at the trial then no
reparation or compensation can _ be
awarded to him for the long incarceration,
as the provisions of Criminal Procedure
Code and the scheme of law on the subject
do not provide for such arrangements to
repair the loss, caused to an accused
person, detaining him in Jail without just
cause and reasonable ground.”

9. Accordingly, this application is allowed. The

accused-petitioners are admitted to bail provided they furnished

bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/-(five lac) with two

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/

Duty Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are local,

reliable and men of means.

10. The above observations are only tentative in nature

for disposal of this bail petition, which shall not influence the

mind of the trial Court at the trial rather it shall record its own
-10-

findings on the basis of evidence to be recorded. The above are

the reasons of my short order of the even date.

Announced.
