ORI

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Having faced trial in
MCTC. Sessions Case No.71/II of 2017-19, the
respondent/accused Marwat Khan was acquitted by
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model
Criminal Trial Court, D.LKhan vide judgment dated
03.8.2019, in case FIR No.140 dated 16.7.2017,
registered under Sections 302/392 PPC, at police station
Chaudhwan, District D.1.Khan.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR Ex. PA, registered on the basis of murasila, in brief,
is that on 16.7.2017 at 2215 hours, complainant Ahmad
Sultan (PW-11) made report on the spot to Muhammad
Din ASI (PW-7) to the effect that he was present in
house when he was informed on cell phone by Sajawal,
resident of Gara Matt that his brother Sher Zaman was

injured by someone at Gara Matta Morr, by firing at
-2-

him. On this information, the complainant alongwith
other co-villagers reached to the spot and found his
brother dead. On query, he was told that his brother
Sher Zaman was on his way from Gara Abdullah to his
house on a motorbike, when he was fired by unknown
assailant at Isha Vela at Gara Matt Morr with firearm,
who took away motorcycle of the deceased bearing
registration No.FH 6245 and cash amount from his
brother. Subsequently, the complainant in his
supplementary statement charged the accused for the
commission of offence.

3. After completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the trial Court.
Accused was charged for the offence to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its
case, the prosecution examined as many as twelve
witnesses, whereafter, the accused was examined under
Section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein, he denied the allegations
and professed innocence, however, he neither opted to
be examined on oath, nor produced evidence in his
defence. The learned trial Court, after hearing arguments
from both the sides, acquitted the accused/respondent
vide impugned judgment dated 03.8.2019, hence the
instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It appears from the FIR that the occurrence
in the present case took place on 16.7.2017 at Isha Vela,
whereas the report was lodged on the same date at about
2215 hours. On the face of it, there is inordinate delay in
lodging the report by the complainant. The report was
lodged against unknown accused by the complainant
who was not an eyewitness of the occurrence,
therefore, the delay in lodging the report has assumed
great significance, as it could be attributed to
consultations, taking instructions and calculatedly
preparing the report keeping in view the names of the
assailants opened for involving such persons who
ultimately the prosecution might wished to nominate. In

this respect, reliance can be placed on case laws reported

as (AIR_1983 S.C.-810) titled 'Ranji_Suriya_and
another Vs. The State of Maharashtra’, 'Allahyar Vs.
The State' (1990 SCMR-1134), ‘Mahmood Ahmad and
3 others Vs. The State and another' (1995 SCMR-127),
‘Imran Hussain Vs. Amir Arshad and 2 others' (1997
SCMR-438) and ‘Muhammad Rafique Vs. The State’
(2014 SCMR-1698). Recently, in case titled Mst. Asia
Bibi Vs. The State and others (PLD 2019 S.C. 64), the
Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan held that:-

“In absence of any plausible

explanation, the Supreme Court had

always considered the delay in lodging

of FIR to be fatal and it casted a

suspicion on the prosecution story,
extending the benefit of doubt to the
-4-

accused---If there was any delay in

lodging of FIR and commencement of

investigation, it gave rise to a doubt,

which, could not be extended to anyone

else except to the accused”.
6. According to prosecution case, one
Sajawal of Garra Matt had informed the complainant
regarding the occurrence, but neither said Sajawal had
signed the report, nor was produced before the Court to
support the above version. In such circumstances, the
chain of events is broken from the very beginning,
which goes to the very roots of the case.. The
complainant while appearing as PW-11 in the witness
box was unable to disclose the source through which
they reached the spot. He further admitted that neither
the afore-named Sajawal was eyewitness of the
occurrence nor he heard the firing. While going through
the statement of complainant, there appear numerous
discrepancies which have comprehensively been
highlighted by the learned trial Court. Even testimony of
complainant is not corroborated by any independent
evidence.
7. So far as recoveries are concerned,
complainant during cross examination stated that the
accused took everything with him from the pocket of his
deceased brother and they received Rs.12,000/- cash
amount as well as motorcycle from the Court, but during

course of recording his statement at first instance, said
-5-

case property was not produced before the Court for
exhibition, however, complainant was re-examined and
only produced mobile Nokia phone 1200 having SIM
No.03459835301, motorcycle FH-6245/DIK Super Star
Model 2016. The aforesaid currency was not produced
before the Court nor was exhibited. Complainant
admitted that no biometric verification of SIM was
produced. In such circumstances, the alleged case
property seems to be planted one, which could not be
used as evidence against respondent/accused.

8. Basharat Khan SHO while appearing in the
witness box as PW-6, during cross examination stated
that the occurrence was reported against unknown
assailant and there was no eyewitness. No daily diary in
respect of departure and arrival is annexed with the
judicial file. Similarly, no identification parade was
conducted. Similarly, he admitted that accused had not
confessed his guilt before any competent Court of law.
Another important prosecution witness was Muhammad
Din ASI (PW-7), who drafted murasila, prepared the
injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased. He was
also witness of recovery of Kalashnikov. During cross
examination, he admitted that the time and source of
receiving information about the occurrence had not been
explained by him. He further admitted that no one was

charged in the initial report. Even, he was unable to
-6-

disclose regarding PW Sajawal. He was also unable to
disclose the fact that by which means the dead body was
shifted to the hospital. PW-6 has not explained the place
where the Chigha party encircled the accused. He was
even unable to disclose the fact that where-from the
stolen articles were recovered on the pointation of
accused. No daily diary in respect of departure and
arrival of said PW from the police station is available on
the file.

9. Next comes the witness of Chigha party
Muhammad Yousaf, who while appearing as PW-8
before the Court, during cross examination, was unable
to disclose the fact of timing of constitution of Chigha
party and reaching to the spot. He was also unable to
disclose the name of person who furnished information
of murder of Sher Zaman. He did not provide source
through which he joined the Chigha party. He admitted
that recovery of cash amount and motorcycle was not
effected in his presence. Another member of the Chigha
party appeared as PW-9 and during cross examination,
he was unable to disclose the name of the person who
informed them about murder of Sher Zaman. He was
also unable to disclose the name of person who informed

them about presence of the accused on the spot.

In case titled Muhammad Khan_and

another Vs, The State (1999 SCMR_1220), it was

observed that:-

“It is axiomatic and universally
recognized principle of law that
conviction must be founded on
unimpeachable evidence and certainty of
guilt and hence any doubt that arises in
the prosecution case must be resolved in
favour of the accused. It is, therefore,
imperative for the Court to examine and
consider all the relevant events preceding
and leading to the occurrence so as to
arrive at a correct conclusion. Where the
evidence examined by the prosecution is
found inherently unreliable, improbable
and against natural course of human
conduct, then the conclusion must be that
the prosecution failed to prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt. It would be
unsafe to rely on the ocular evidence
which has been moulded, changed and
improved step by step so as to fit in with
the other evidence on record. It is obvious
truth and falsity of the prosecution case
can only be judged when the entire
evidence and circumstances are
scrutinized and examined in its correct
perspective”.

In the case reported as Irfan Ali Vs. The

State (2015 SCMR 840), it was observed that:

“cau, 302(b)---Qatl-i-amd---Death sentence,
award of---Evidence---Interested or inimical
witnesses---To award a capital punishment in
a murder crime, it was imperative for the
prosecution to lead unimpeachable evidence
of a first degree, which ordinarily must get
strong corroboration from other independent
evidence if the witnesses were interested or
inimical towards the accused”.

11. So far as recovery of seven empties of 7.62
bore from the spot and the Kalashnikov allegedly

recovered from the accused are concerned, suffice it to
-8-

say that as per recovery memo, the empties were
recovered on 17.7.2017 and the same alongwith the
Kalashnikov were sent to the FSL where these were
received on 02.8.2017. Though the FSL report Ex. PK is
in positive, but the same could not be taken into
consideration being not procured in accordance with
law, as it is now well settled that the prosecution must
ensure safe dispatch of the crime empties and weapon to
the FSL which has not been done in the present case.

In a case titled Ghulam Akbar and

another Vs. The State (2008 SCMR-1064, it was

observed by their Lordships that law requires that
empties recovered from the spot should be sent to the
laboratory without any delay, failing which such
evidence was not free from doubt and could not be used
against the accused. Even otherwise, this piece of
evidence is a corroborative one and in cases where direct
evidence fails, corroborative piece of evidence is of no
avail as in the instant case where direct evidence of PWs
have already been disbelieved. In this respect, case
reported as Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs The

State (2019 SCMR 652), can also be referred.

12. The medical evidence furnished by
the doctor (PW-2) is of no avail to the prosecution, as it

is well settled that the medical evidence does not
-9-

identify the assailants, rather it is a corroborative piece
of evidence.

13. Besides the above, generally the order of
acquittal cannot be interfered with because the
presumption of innocence of the accused is further
strengthened by acquittal. The golden thread which runs
through the web of administration of justice in criminal
cases is, that, if two views are possible on the evidence
adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the
accused and the other to his innocence, the view which
is favourable to the accused should be adopted. The
paramount consideration of the Court is to ensure that
miscarriage of justice is prevented. A miscarriage of
justice which may arise from acquittal of the guilty is no
less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case
where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty is casted
upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the evidence in
a case where the accused has been acquitted, or the
purpose of ascertaining as to whether the accused
committed the offence or not. The principle to be
followed by this Court considering the appeal against the
judgment of acquittal is, to interfere only when there are
compelling and substantial reasons for doing so. If the
impugned judgment is clearly unreasonable, it is a

compelling reason for interference.

14. We have gone through the impugned
judgment of the learned trial Court and the Court in its
judgment has dealt with each and every aspect of the
case and the findings it rendered are based on proper
appreciation of evidence, which being unexceptional
cannot be interfered with.

15. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, we
see no illegality or irregularity in the impugned
judgment which could attract this Court to reverse the
same. Hence, this appeal being without merit and

substance is hereby dismissed.
