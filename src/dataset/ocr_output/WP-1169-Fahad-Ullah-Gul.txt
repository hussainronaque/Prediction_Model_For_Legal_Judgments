LAL JAN KHATTAK, J:- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 14.12.2018 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV/Judge
Special Court, Peshawar delivered in
case FIR No.1072 dated 13.12.2016
under section 9 (c) of the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 of police
station Phandu, Peshawar whereby the
appellant has been convicted and
sentenced to imprisonment for life with
fine of Rs.1,000, 000/- (ten lac) or in
default whereof to further suffer simple
imprisonment for 06 months with benefit
under section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on

13.12.2016 complainant of the case
namely, Majid Khan, Inspector (PW-1)
along with Squad of Excise & Taxation
received spy information about
trafficking of huge quantity of narcotics
from Jamrud Khyber Agency via Ring
Road to Lahore, Punjab through
motorcar bearing Registration No.LW-
4104/Lahore. In order to foil the bid, he
arranged a Nakabandi on the spot when
in the meantime the motorcar reached
there which was signaled to stop. Driver
of the vehicle disclosed his name as
Suleman Khan. On search of the
vehicle, 70 packets of charas were
recovered lying in secret cavity made in
rear bumper of the vehicle. On
weighment, the charas turned out to be
84 Kg. From the recovered stuff 5/5,
grams were separated for the purpose
of FSL from each packet while the rest
was sealed in separate parcel.

3. On completion of investigation,
challan was put in court which indicted
the accused for the offence to which he

pleaded not guilty. In order to prove its
case, prosecution examined 07
witnesses whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded wherein he
professed his innocence. After
conclusion of the trial, the learned trial
court found the appellant guilty of the
charge and while recording his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned
above.

4. Arguments heard and_ record
available gone through.

5. No doubt, according to the FIR
(Ex.PA), total 84000 gram charas was
recovered by Inspector Majid Khan
(P.W-1) from the secret cavity prepared
in the motorcar which at the relevant
time was being driven by the appellant,
however, pertinent aspect of the case is
that the 70 representative samples
taken from the recovered packets on
13.12.2016 were received at the FSL for
their chemical analysis on 19.12.2016
i.e. after a delay of 06 days for which no
reasonable explanation has been given

by the prosecution. Not the above but
another noticeable aspect of the case is
that the representative samples were
received by P.W-7 namely, F.C Habib
Khan from P.W-3 Noor Muhammad on
14.12.2016 for their taking to the FSL,
however, same were delivered at FSL
on 19.12.2016 and no material is
available on record of the case to show
that in whose custody the samples had
remained during those 06 days. Ibid
aspect of the case has blurred the
prosecution case as to its accuracy
benefit of which must go to the accused
as it has been held umpteenth times by
the superior courts that in order to bring
home guilt to an accused charged in
narcotic cases, the prosecution must
prove through very reliable evidence
that the samples had remained in safe
custody till their receipt at FSL which is
not the case in hand. Besides, in the
register 19, extract from which is
available as Ex.P.W-3/1, there is no
entry in the relevant column that the

representative samples were deposited
in the police malkhana. In addition to the
above, the official namely constable
Farhad who had taken the case
murasila from the spot to the police
station, who was also a witness to
occurrence, too was not produced by
the prosecution which aspect of the
case has also caused cracks in the
prosecution otherwise fragile case.

6. Thorough and careful examination
of the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case
against the appellant beyond any
shadow of doubt and it is the cardinal
principle of criminal law that in order to
bring home guilt to an accused, the
prosecution must establish its case
through reliable and trustworthy
evidence, which is not the case in hand
for which the judgment of the learned
trial court is not sustainable.

7. For what has been discussed
above, this appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment of conviction and

sentence is set aside and consequently,
the appellant is acquitted of the charge
leveled against him. He be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other

case.
