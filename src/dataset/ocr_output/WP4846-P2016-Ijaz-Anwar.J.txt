7. Rule 38 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Motor

4

procedure how to. deal with the issue to provide the duplicate

‘copy of the Registration Book while Rule 40 only provides that

where the original Registration book is found subsequently it
shall be returned to the Registering Authority, but it is silent to
the fact that which one of the Registration books, original or
duplicate will remain in the field.

8 Initially vide office order dated 01.9.2008 of the

Director General, “Excise and Taxation, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa;

’ Peshawar instructions were issued to the following effect. Para-2

is reproduced below:-

» “In order to facilitate the general public all
Motor Registering Authorities are directed to
consider the recovered computerized registration

\

book as original one and cancel and file the

» duplicate registration book on the basis of
FIR/Naqalmad after observing all  codal
formalities”. . -

- only refer to the fact’that when the original Registration book is

found subsequently, it shall be returned to the Motor

Registration Authority but it is silent how to deal with it

subsequently. The instructions issued vide office order dated
01.9.2008 of the Registration Authority were quite reasonable
and appeal to ‘reasons, however, the subsequent instructions
issued vide office ofder dated 12.5.2012 is against the intension
and. plain reading of Rule 40 ibid and had given such
construction, which i no where suggest. |

11. ‘It is by now well settled that construction of

_astatute should be beneficial to the citizen and if there could be
‘two interpretations of a provision of law in a statute, the one
which was consistent. with reasons should be adopted and the
one which lead to, absurdity or unreasonableness or patent
injustice to a citizen should be avoided, therefore, the
construction placed on a provision in a statute, should be such as --

would suppress the: mischief and advance the remedy. Reliance

placed on 2016 SCMR 646, 2015 SCMR 1494, PLD 2016

Peshawar-26 and 2013 P.Cr.L.J, 52 (KHO©).

12, _ We having examined the Rules and the
construction placed ‘on it through two conflicting letters dated
01.9.2008 and 25.5.2012, and tends to resolve it by upholding
the letter dated 01:9.2008 to be more reasonable and beneficial
for the citizens as it Suppress the mischief and advance the
remedy. |
