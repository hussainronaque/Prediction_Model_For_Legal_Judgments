Zz. The occurrence was reported to police
by complainant Bakht Rawan (PW-3) in emergency
ward of DHQ Hospital, Timergara on 09.09.2017 at
18:30 hours. According to his narrations in |
Murasila/F.1.R, his nephew Khan Bahadar (PW-2)
had gone to the nearby shops for purchasing food
stuffs. While coming back when he reached near the
house of Zar Zamin, the present appellant and his
absconding co-accused, who were already present
there, stopped his nephew and questioned him with
regard to his passage over the thoroughfare. A
scuffle took place between them during which the
appellant drew out his pistol and fired at Khan
Bahadar whereby. he sustained injury on the left side
of his chest. The occurrence was stated to have been

witnessed by complainant, Umar Hayat and Zar

Zamin whereas dispute over the thoroughfare was

mentioned as the motive behind the occurrence.

3. After recording the report of
complainant in shape of Murasila (Ex.PA/1),
Muhibullah $.H.O (P-10) prepared the injury sheet
(Ex.PW-10/1) of the injured and submitted the same
for opinion of the doctor. The gist of medical reports
Ex.PW-4/1 to Ex.PW-4/3 prepared by Dr.
Muhammad Salim (PW-4) after examining the

injured, is as under:

Date and time of arrival in Emergency:
09.09.2017 at 06:15 P.M.

One entrance fire arm injury (FAI), wound
size 2 cm circular in shape with inverted
margins over the left side chest 3 cm below the

One exit (FAI, wound size 3 cm circular in
shape with everted margins over the back left
side chest.

4. During spot inspection, the
Investigating Officer (PW-9) collected two crime
empties of 30-bore pistol with one live cartridge
from the spot and also secured blood-stained shirt of
the injured through recovery memo. After remaining

absconder for one month, the local elders produced

the appellant before police alongwith the crime
weapon 30 bore pistol regarding which he could not
produce any license/permit. The pistol was sent for
forensic analysis qua the recovered crime empties
which have matched inter se as per F.S.L report

Ex.PW-9/20.

5. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court where formal
charge was framed against the appellant, however,
he denied the allegation of prosecution by pleading
not guilty. Prosecution produced and examined
eleven PWs in support of its case and closed the
evidence. After examination of the appellant u/s 342,
Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
10.07.2020 found him guilty of the charge, hence,
sentenced him in the manner discussed above. The
appellant, being aggrieved of his conviction and
sentence, has challenged the judgment of the learned

trial Court through this appeal.

7. | -  Perusal of the record would reveal that
the occurrence has taken place in daylight wherein
injured Khan Bahadar sustained firearm injury by
the firing of present appellant in presence of eye
witnesses out of whom complainant Bakht Rawan
appeared before the Court as PW-3 whereas the
injured himself appeared in the witness box as
PW-2. Being victim of the same occurrence by
sustaining firearm injury on his person, presence of
the injured PW-2 is established without any doubt.
His statement being worth credence cannot be
discarded on the basis of minor contradictions which
do happen with the passage of time as observed by
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

Mawas Khan Vs. The State and another reported as

PLD 2004 Supreme Court 330.

It is also to be noted that Murtaza (P.W.2) also
sustained injuries which confirms his presence
at the spot. Even otherwise the statement of
injured witness cannot be brushed aside
merely on the ground of some minor
contradictions which do creep in the passage
on time.

Similarly, the complainant has appeared
before the Court as PW-3 and his statement
corroborate the narrations of the injured witness.

The statements of both the aforesaid witnesses are

Tajamul/PS* | (0.8) Hontble Mr, Justice Ishtiaa brahim:
Tajamul/Ps*;

-6-
consistent on material particulars of the occurrence
and there was no reason for them to implicate an
innocent person in the case, therefore, their
testimony was rightly relied upon by trial Court for
convicting the present appellant. Objection of
learned counsel for the appellant that both the eye
witnesses are interested, is repelled on the ground
that there is no inflexible rule that statement of an
interested witness can never be accepted without
corroboration. When the Court gets the satisfaction
that no innocent person was implicated alongwith
the guilty, the Court can consider the statement of an
interested witness if corroborated through
independent source. Guidance is sought from the
judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
in the case of Riaz Hussain Vs. The State (2001
SCMR 177). The rule laid down by the august Court

is as under:

In order, therefore, to be satisfied that no
innocent persons are being implicated
alongwith the guilty, the Court will in the case
of an ordinary interested witness look for some
circumstance that gives sufficient support to
his statement so as to create that degree of
probability which can be made the basis of
conviction, This is what is meant by saying
that the statement of an interested witness
ordinarily needs corroboration.

8. - The ocular account is corroborated by
medical evidence as well as recoveries in shape of
crime empties, crime weapon and blood-stained shirt
of the injured. The prosecution has produced Dr.
Muhammad Salim (PW-4) as well as the relevant
witnesses of the recovery memos namely constable
Nazir Syed (PW-5), constable Saeedullah (PW-6)
and constable Umar Rehman (PW-7) who have
supported the recoveries of blood-stained shirt of the
injured, two crime empties from the spot and
recovery of pistol from the appellant at the time of
his arrest. Their testimony cannot be brushed aside
on the sole ground that they are police officials
because it is settled law that police officials are as
good witnesses as other private witnesses unless it is
proved that they have deposed against the accused
with ill-will or mala fide, which is not the situation

before this Court in the present case.

9. Thus, in view of the overwhelming
direct and circumstantial evidence available on the
record, the learned trial Court has rightly convicted
the present appellant after proper appraisal of
evidence available against the appellant on record.

At the this juncture, the learned counsel for the

(0.8) Hon’ble Mc. Justice [shttag Ibrohin
TalamuyPs*

-8-
appellant argued that the injury caused on the person
of injured Khan Bahadar is not covered by the »
definition of Jaifa as defined in section 337-C,
P.P.C. In support of his above contention he
produced copy of the judgment of Lahore High
Court in the case of Pervaiz Khan Vs. The State
reported as PLD 1998 Lahore 84 wherein the word
“body cavity of the trunk” was discussed and it was
observed that if an injury does not cause any damage
to any organ located inside the cavity and merely
passes through flesh or muscles, cannot be treated or

considered as Jaifah.

10. The objection raised by learned counsel
for the appellant needs wide consideration of this
Court. According to medico-legal report (Ex.PW-
4/1) on the injury sheet, the doctor has found one
entry wound of 2 cm in size circular in shape with
inverted margins over the left side chest 3 cm below
the left side nipple the exit of which was found over

the back left side chest of 3 cm in size circular in

shape with everted margins. The I.O sought opinion

of the District Public Prosecutor through application

Ex.PW-9/3 who opined that:

(0.8) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtfag ibrahin

Medico-legal report in respect of injured Khan
Bahadar examined which shows that the injury
extends to the body cavity and there are
perforations in wall of stomach, therefore,

section it attracts 337-D P.P.C.

Section 337-D P.P.C prescribes punishment for jaifa

whereas the word “jaifa” has been defined in section 337-C,

P.P.C which read:

337-C. Jaifah. Whoever causes jurh in which
the injury extends to the body cavity of the
trunk, is said to cause jaifah.

The plain reading of section 337-C

shows that once the injury extends to body cavity of

the trunk then that is Jaifa notwithstanding that any

damage has been caused to any vital part of the body

or any evidence has been led by prosecution or not

most particularly by keeping in view the particular

circumstances of the present case. In order to know

that what is “jurh”, the relevant section 337-B is

reproduced below for ready reference.

337-B. Jurh. (1) Whoever causes on any part of
the body of a person, other than the head or
face, a hurt which leaves a mark of the wound,
whether temporary or permanent, is said to
cause jurh.

(2) Jurh is of two kinds, namely:--
(a) Jaifah; and
(b) Ghayr-jaifah.

Jurh Ghayr-jaifah has been defined in

section 337-E P.P.C which reads.

TalamuyPs*,

(0.8)

Hon'ble Me, Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Tappmulese|

-10-

337-E. Ghayr-jaifah. Whoever causes jurh
which does not amount to jaifah, is said to cause
ghayr-jaifa.

Learned counsel for the appellant
argued that there is no evidence that any major or
vital organ of the victim was injured, thus, he
questioned the applicability of section 337-C, P.P.C
to the present case which is misconceived because,
as discussed earlier, section 337-C is applicable
when once the injury enters the body cavity
notwithstanding whether it has damaged any major
or vital organ or not. The word trunk has been
defined in Dorland’s Pocket Medical Dictionary

(29" Edition) as under:

1, The main part of the body, to which head and
limbs are attached. 2. A major, undivided and
often short, part of a nerve, vessel, or duct.

’ The British Medical Association
complete Family Health Encyclopedia has defined

the word “trunk” in the following words.

The central part of the body, comprising the
thorax (chest) and abdomen, to which the head
and limbs are attached. The term trunk also
refers to any large blood vessel or nerve from
which smaller vessels or nerves branch off.

Similarly, the same word has been
defined in Black’s Medical Dictionary (37" Edition)

according to which “trunk” is:

(0.6) Hon‘ble Mr, Justice ishtlag Ibrahim,
Tajamuyes+|

-i1-

A major vessel or nerve from which lesser ones
arise, or the main part of the body excluding the
head, neck and limbs.:

The word “Jaifah” has been defined in
wohagt Osi ul by Maulana Salamt Ali Khan at

Page-343 in the following words.

In view of the medical report and the
above definitions of trunk and Jaifah under the
Islamic Law, the injury sustained by the injured in
the present case is covered by definition of Jaifa and
the learned trial Court has committed no illegality by
directing the appellant to pay arsh equivalent to 1/3"
of the amount of Diyat on his conviction u/s 337-D,

P.P.C.

il. The judgment referred by learned
counsel for the appellant in Pervaiz Khan’s case

supra has no relevance with the facts and

circumstances of the present case because in the ibid
case the injured had sustained firearm entry wound
over back of right upper chest 6 cm from right
posterior axillary fold 12 cm from right clavicle
which made its exit on front of right upper chest
running transversely parallel to middle of right
clavicle which was 5 cm from middle and 4 cm
below right clavicle. In the present case, the position
of injury is quite different because the injured has
sustained firearm entry wound on the left side of
chest below the left nipple the exit of which was
found on the back left side of chest. Thus, it is clear
from the aforesaid difference that the injury
sustained by the injured in the present case has
extended to body cavity which is not the position in

the above referred judgment.

12. For what has been discussed above,
learned counsel for the appellant could not make out
a case for interference in the impugned judgment,
therefore, this appeal, being devoid of merits, is

accordingly dismissed.
