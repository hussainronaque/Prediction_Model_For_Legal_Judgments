shape of Qameez, Ex. PW-19/8 and pictures,
Ex. PW-19/10 to 19/12. The pictures of the
dead body of the deceased Mst. Salma Bibi
were made by Maqbool Hussain alias Ashiq,
PW-16, however, in the present case the said
pictures of the dead body of the deceased were
produced before the complainant on
03.12.2013, who had identified that the said
pictures were of #@ her deceased daughter
through identification memo Ex. PW-14/1 on
03.12.2013. The dead body of the deceased
was medically examined by lady doctor
Mahnaz Khan, PW-21 on 01.12.2013 at 12:30
P.M. The acquitted accused Nausherawan,
Sherin Zada and Bakht Munir on 03.12.2013
made pointation of the graveyard of the
deceased. Challan against the accused was
placed before the trial Court on 24.01.2014. In

the said proceedings the present appellant

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Naseeb Zada, Khaista Gul, Hazrat Wali- and
Gul Zada were proceeded under section 512
Cr.P.C. However, at the trial, the
complainant-party effected compromise with
the then arrested accused Nausherawan,
Sherin Zada and Bakht Munir on 04.08.2014
and as such on the basis of compromise they
were acquitted by the trial Court on the same
date.

4. On 09.9.2015 the accused-
appellant Naseeb Zada alongwith Khaista Gul |

and Gul Zada had obtained bail before arrest

from the competent Court, however, the said

application was dismissed on 18.9.2015,
consequently. they were arrested and
supplementary challan was submitted against
them before the trial Court on 14.10.2015.
5. During trial, the prosecution has
produced as many as 22 witnesses whose
statements were recorded and placed on file.
On closure of the prosecution evidence, the
accused were examined under section 342,

Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the charges,

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Alt
claimed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case.

6. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court convicted the appellant
vide judgment impugned herein, whereas the
co-accused Gul Zada and Khaista Gul were
acquitted of the charges by extending them
the benefit of doubt.

7. We have heard arguments of
learned counsels for the accused/appellant,
learned Astt: Advocate General appearing on
behalf of the State and gone through the
record with their able assistance.

8. It is evident from record that the
local police took cognizance of the offence on
registration of FIR, Ex. PW-17/1 by the
complainant Mst. Dil Hasiyat on 27.11.2013,
wherein on the said date at 17:00 hours she
had ~—s reported = that’ =o her — daughter
Mst. Salma Bibi was married to the present

NAWAB/PS* OB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
appellant some 8 years back, out of the
wedlock they had two children. The present
appellant was working for gain at Saudi
Arabia for the last 6/7 months. Her daughter
Mst. Salma Bibi was not on good terms with
the appellant and therefore for the last 6
months she was residing with the
complainant. On 22.10.2013 when she had
gone to the house of her father-in-law Khoona
Gul. on her return at 12:15 hours to her house,
the younger daughter of the deceased namely
Sony informed her that the accused
Nausherawan (acquitted accused), who was
the cousin of the appellant took along Mst.
Salma for medical treatment and collecting of
money sent by Naseeb Zada (appellant) for
her. However, till evening when her daughter
could not come back, she started inquiry about

the whereabouts of her daughter from the

NAWAB/PS* = OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
i

hospital at Timergara and the in-laws of her
daughter, however, no clue of Mst. Salma was
traced. On the following day i.e. 23.10.2013,
the present appellant called her through her
cell number and assured her that Mst. Salma
is safe, however, after few days, he once again
called her that on the direction of the appellant
the accused Nausherawan took along Mst.
Salma on pretext of medical treatment,
however, later with the help of the brothers of
the appellant namely Sherin Zada and Bakht
Munir Killed her. She had also recorded her
conversation with the appellant, therefore,
charged the accused Nausherawan, Sherin
Zada and Bakht Munir for the murder of
deceased and the present appellant Naseeb
Zada for the abetment. Motive was that the
appellant suspected the deceased being

involved in illicit relations with other men.

9. The prosecution case against the
present appellant rests on the statement of the
complainant, PW-5, the conversation recorded
wherein the appellant had confessed his guilt,
the confessional statement of his brother
acquitted accused Bakht Munir and the
recovery of the dead body of the deceased.

10. Allegedly, the deceased went
along with the acquitted accused
Nausherawan on 22.10.2013. When the
complainant appeared before the Court as
PW-S, she had reiterated the story narrated by
her in the FIR that the deceased was taken
along by acquitted accused Nausherawan and
she had a first conversation with the appellant
on the following day i.e. 23.10.2013 and
subsequently after 7 days the appellant had
informed the complainant that the deceased

was killed by Nausherawan and his brothers

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
si

Sherin Zada and Bakht Munir on his direction,
however, despite this fact/disclosure on behalf
of the appellant she did not lodge any
reporv/FIR till 27.11.2013, the said FIR was
registered after almost 35 days of the
occurrence and after 28 days when she
(complainant) was informed by the present
appellant about his role of abetment,
therefore, there is inordinate considerable
delay in registration of the FIR, which
remained unexplained during the _ trial
proceedings. In case of such unexplained
delay in lodging of FIR creates serious doubt
on the authenticity of the prosecution version.
It was laid by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in “Muhammad Akram _vs_the
State” (2009 SCMR_ 230).-“Conduct of the
father of the abductee, who knew the accused,

lodged the FIR after an ordinate delay of six

NAWAB/PS* = DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
months of the abduction and recovery of his
son, had cast heavy doubt on the veracity of
the FIR.

11. However, the most important
fact, which is fatal to the prosecution case is
the alleged recovery of the dead body of the
deceased Mst. Salma by local police of police
station Risalpur on 01.12.2013. The recovery
of dead body was reported through FIR No.
688, Ex. PB dated 01.12.2013. According to
the said FIR, the dead body of an
unidentifiable woman was recovered from
field, who was slaughtered. On the same date
ie. 01.12.2013 at 12:30 hours the dead body
of the deceased was medically examined by
lady doctor Mahnaz Khan, PW-21 whose
report Ex. PW-21/1 contained the following
observations in respect of the dead body of the

deceased:-

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
aie

-ll-

° Half of the neck was cut
extending from one ear to another.
Decomposed body wearing blue
colored printed shirt and plain
shalwar. The whole body was
swollen and peeling of skin
present. Maggots were also
present. Due to  putrefaction
changes face and organs were
distorted. In my opinion cause of
death was asphyxia due to cutting
down of neck organs and blood
vessels.’

In view of the above report, the
probable time between the death and
postmortem of the deceased was 48/72 hours.
PW-21 in her cross-examination has stated
that the face of the dead body of the deceased
was distorted and not identifiable. PW-16
Magbool Hussain alias Ashiq had caught
pictures of the dead body of the deceased,
which are placed on record as Ex. PW-16/1 to
Ex. PW-16/8. Similarly, PW-22 the then Sub
Inspect of police station Risalpur had also
confirmed that the face of the dead body of

the deceased was not identifiable. According

to the prosecution case i.e. statement of the

NAWAB/PS" DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
-12-

complainant, PW-5 that the deceased was
killed on 23.10.2013 and in the confessional
statement of the acquitted accused Bakht
Munir he had also confessed that on the
following day of 22.10.2013 at Isha Vela the
deceased was killed, however, the dead body
was recovered on 01.12.2013 after 36/37 days
of the occurrence and according to the
medical report the approximate time between
death of the deceased and postmortem was
48/72 hours. Therefore, the dead body of the
lady, which was recovered on 01.12.2013
might have been killed on 29.11.2013 and not
before that. Hence, in the aforesaid
circumstances, it is established on record that
the dead body which was recovered and has
been considered to be the dead body of Mst. }
Salma, cannot presumed to be her dead body

in view of the above-referred contradiction

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
-13-

between the version of prosecution and the
medical evidence, therefore, the death of Mst.
Salma could not be established before the trial
Court.

12. Although, Bakht Munir, the
acquitted co-accused has confessed his guilt
during the investigation on 04.12.2013 before
the Judicial Magistrate, PW-18, wherein he
has also charged the present appellant for
abetting the murder of the deceased, however,
in order to prove the said confession against
its maker, it must be established that the said
confessional statement was voluntary and
true. In the present case, the maker of the
confession was arrested on 29.11.2013 and the
alleged confession was made 04.12.2013 after
delay of 5 days. Thus, recording confession at
such belated stage when the accused remained

in police custody for about 5 days, the said

NAWAB/PS* — DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
5

-14-

confession does not appear to be true because
the identity of the deceased could not be
established.

Even otherwise, the confession of
accused is a circumstantial evidence against
the co-accused under Article 43 Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, which need strong
corroboration. In this regard reliance is placed .
on “Mushtag and others vs the State (2012
SCMR_109)”, wherein it was held by the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan:- “As the
accused did not admit to have killed the
deceased, therefore, he could not be held
responsible for killing on the confessional
statements of co-accused.”

The same ratio further reflects in

“

Abdur _Rehman’s case reported as 2018

YER_1629”, wherein it was held by the

Hon’ble High Court:- “Confession made by

NAWAB/PS* DB: “Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
-15-

accused could not be used as a substantive
piece of evidence to make the same basis of
conviction of co-accused. Confessional
statement could be used a corroborative piece
of evidence, if corroborated by independent

evidence.’

13. Admittedly, at the time of
missing of the alleged deceased, she was in
the house of her parents and the present
appellant was at Saudi Arabia, therefore, his
alleged role was only that of abatter, who has
confessed his guilt before the complainant on
cellphone and the said statement was
recorded. The said recording was produced
before the Court, however, it is still a mystery
that who has recorded the said conversation as
the complainant herself is an illiterate woman
and no expert evidence has been procured by

the prosecution to establish that the voice so

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

recorded was that of the present appellant or
otherwise. True, that under Article 164 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the Court may
allow prosecution of any evidence that may
have become available because of modern
devices/techniques etc, however, the
prosecution has failed to establish that indeed
the voice so recorded was that of the appellant
and even the person who has made the
recording was also not produced before the
Court by the prosecution, therefore, this
evidence is also not worth reliance.

14. The gist of the whole discussion
is that the prosecution case against the
accused/appellant is pregnant with doubts and
it is settled principle of law that in case of
doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in
favour of the accused as a matter of right and

not of grace.

15. In view of the above discussion,
we are of the absolute view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the accused/appellant beyond any shadow of
doubt; nevertheless the death of alleged
deceased could not be established, therefore,
his conviction cannot’ be maintained,
resultantly, we accept this appeal by setting
aside his conviction and sentence recorded by
the learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment dated 12.04.2017 and acquit him of
the charge levelled against him. He be set free
forthwith, if not required in any other case,

16. These are the reasons of our short
order of even date.
