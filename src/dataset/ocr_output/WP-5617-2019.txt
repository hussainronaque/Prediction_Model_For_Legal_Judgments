for the petitioner.

Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, AAG, for
respondents.

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the petition in hand,
filed under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner
(Fazal-e-Haq) has prayed this Court for the
following relief:-

“It is most respectfully prayed that
this Hon’ble Court may graciously be
pleased to issue a writ in favour of
the petitioner by directing the
respondents

i. To direct reduction of 02
years SI in default of payment
of fine to 06 months;

ii. To direct concurrent running
of substantial imprisonment
with the imprisonment in
default of payment;

iii. To grant any other adequate
remedy or _ remission not
specifically asked but deemed

”

Sit by this august Court.

2. In essence, the petitioner, after having been

tried by the learned trial Court in a criminal case
under section 9-C CNSA, 1997, was convicted and
sentenced to 14 years RI with fine of Rs.500,000/- or
in default thereof to suffer 02 years S.I. It is further
averred in the petition that the convict/petitioner has
already served 06 years & 11 months of his
substantial sentence while has earned 07 years & 9
months remission and his date of release has already
expired on 15.02.2019, but he is still behind the bars
and serving the simple imprisonment of 2 years in
default of payment thereof, hence the instant writ
petition.

3. Before parting with this order, it is necessary
to have a look at the provision of Section-65 of the

Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) which reads as under:-

“S.65. Limit to imprisonment for non-
payment of fine, when imprisonment
and fine awardable—The term for
which the Court directs the offender to be
imprisoned in default of payment of a fine
shall not exceed one-fourth of the term of
imprisonment which is the maximum
fixed for the offence, if the offence be
punishable with imprisonment as well as
fine.”

Bare perusal of above section of law reveals that it
does not provide minimum but contemplates
maximum i.e. not more than 1/4" of a sentence
actually passed by Trial Court. Section 35, Cr.P.C.
empowers Trial Court to allow substantive sentences

to run concurrently, but this power is not conferred

upon it, in case of sentence or sentences provided in
lieu of default of payment of fine. Sentence of
imprisonment in lieu of default of payment of fine is
a separate and distinct punishment and is in addition
to the main sentence or substantive sentence. No
Court has power to direct that sentence in default of
payment of fine shall run concurrently with
substantive sentences or even when sentences of fine
are awarded for more than one offences. Section 65-
P.P.C. only governs the question of sentence in lieu
of default in payment of fine and S.35, Cr.P.C. only
deals with the substantive punishments. Section 65-
P.P.C. refers to 1/4" of a "sentence" and not of
"sentences". Reliance could be placed on case titled
“Mian Khan v. Government of the Punjab and
others” reported in 2005 P.Cr.L.J 627 & PLD 2008
Lahore 497.

4. Even otherwise, the sentence in lieu of
payment of fine awarded to the present petitioner is
02 years S.I, whereas the maximum punishment
awarded to him for the offence is 14 years R.I. If
reckoned with ratio of 1/4" in light of provision of
Section 65-PPC referred to above, the sentence in
default of payment of fine would become 3 & %
years. Therefore, the learned trial Court has fully

complied with the governing provision and also

shown its leniency in awarding the default sentence,
which cannot, at all, be reduced, by this Court while
exercising the Constitution jurisdiction under Article
199,

5. In view of the forgoing discussion, the instant
writ petition, being meritless, is dismissed, in limine.
