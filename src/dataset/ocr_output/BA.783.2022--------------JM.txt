Vs
The State etc
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 20.04.2022

Petitioner (s) by: | M/s Anjum Pervez and Nazmeen Akhtar,
Advocates

State by: Mr. Muhammad Nisar Khan, AAG

Complainant by: = Mr. Amin-ur-Rehman Yousafzai,
Advocate

S M ATTIQUE SHAH, J-. The petitioner seeks his

post arrest bail in case FIR No. 123 dated
08.02.2022 charged under section 489-F PPC
registered at Police Station Shaheed Gulfat
Hussain, Peshawar. Earlier, the petitioner was
declined similar relief by Additional Sessions Judge-
IV, Peshawar vide order dated 14.03.2022.

2. Heard. Record perused.

3. Record reflects that accused/petitioner is

charged by the complainant for issuing him three

cheques, (i) cheque bearing No.10327928
Thsan

amounting to Rs.40,800,000, issued on 12.10.2021,
(ii) cheque bearing No. 10327929 amounting to
Rs.1, 60,00,000/, issued on 21.10.2021 and; (iii)
cheque bearing No.10327930 amounting to
Rs.94,50,000/-, issued on 21.10.2021, in
consideration regarding business transaction qua
supply of different Mobile sets to the
accused/petitioner, which on presentation before
the concerned Bank, were dishonored on account
of alleged payment stopped by the drawer and;
insufficient funds.

4. Be that as it may, without going into deep
merits of the case, lest it may prejudice the case of
either party at the trial, suffice it to say that the
offence with which the petitioner is charged, does
not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C. Besides, the maximum punishment
provided for the offence is three years, or with fine,
or with both. The scheme of section 497 Cr.PC is to
release an accused on bail if his case does not fall
within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.PC.
Indeed, bail in such like cases is a rule, and refusal
thereof is an exception. (2021 SCMR 2092)

“Muhammad Nasir Shafique Vs The State
through Prosecutor General Punjab and
another”. (2011 SCMR 1708) “Riaz Jafar Natiq
Vs Muhammad Nadeem Dar and others”.

5. Given, that a huge amount is involved in the
instant case, however, the legislature in its wisdom
has provided in clear terms that the offence shall
be punishable with imprisonment which may
extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.
Therefore, bail cannot be withheld merely on the
ground of the involvement of a huge amount in a
case. Granted, that bail can be declined in offences,
which do not fall within the prohibitory clause of
section 497 Cr.PC, but, in the circumstances, when
strong and; exceptional grounds exist, i.e. where
the accused is habitual or has misused the
concession of bail, which is certainly not the case
here. Moreso, it is settled that to err in granting
bail is better than to err in declining it.

6. So far as the registration of other criminal
cases against the accused/petitioner is concerned,
there is nothing on record regarding his previous
conviction in any of such cases. Mere registration of
other cases against an accused without any

conviction therein is not sufficient ground to deprive
him of the concession of bail. Besides, investigation
in the case is complete and the petitioner is no
more required for further probe, therefore, it would
serve no useful purpose to keep him behind the
bars for an indefinite period.

7. Furthermore, the enlargement of an accused
on bail does not amount to his acquittal, rather,
instead of being in jail, he is surrendered into the
hands of sureties, who are responsible for his
presence before the trial Court.

8. For what has been discussed above, this
petition is allowed and the petitioner is admitted to
bail, provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees one Million) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction
of Illagqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

Above are the detailed reasons for the short
order of even date, which is the result of the
tentative assessment of the available record of the
case, which shall not influence the judicial mind of

the learned trial Court in any manner.
