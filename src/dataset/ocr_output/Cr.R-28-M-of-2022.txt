JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Complainant Syed
Ahmad, herein petitioner, through this petition under
Section 439 read with Section 561-A of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 has challenged the order of
the learned Sessions Judge, Dir Lower at Timergara
dated 13.05.2022 whereby application of the District
Public Prosecutor (DPP) was accepted and the accused
were discharged in case FIR No. 131 dated 24.12.2021
under Sections 302, 109/34 PPC, 15 A.A. registered at
P.S Talash, District Dir Lower.

2. Precise facts of the case are that petitioner
made a report to local police on 24.12.2019 at 09:00
hours regarding dual murders of Siddiq Ullah and Mst.
Nabila Bibi, his son and daughter-in-law respectively,
on the same day at 06:45 hours in their residential
room by some unknown accused. Petitioner recorded

his statement under Section 164, Cr.P.C. on

Taamurcs*| OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr, shahid Khan
10.11.2021 wherein he charged Ubaid Ullah, Amjad Ali
and Muhammad Sherin for committing murders of both
the deceased at the instigation of their co-accused Mst.
Bakht Haram (Eram Bibi) out of whom Ubaid Ullah
(respondent No.4) remained at large whereas the
remaining accused (respondents No. 2, 3 & 5} were
arrested. Final report under Section 173, Cr.P.C. was
submitted before the Court with request for trial of the
arrested accused and for proceedings under Section
512, Cr.P.C. against the absconding accused.
Alongwith challan, the DPP submitted application
under Section 4{1)(c)(ii) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and
Powers) Act, 2005 read with Section 494, Cr.P.C. for
discharge of the accused, except the absconding
accused, from the case. After hearing the parties, the
learned trial Court accepted the application vide order
dated 15.05.2022 and accordingly discharged the
accused, hence, instant petition.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended
that the learned trial Court has accepted the
application of prosecution for discharge of the accused
against the law, norms of justice and without
application of judicious mind. He further contended
that the Prosecution Act does not empower the DPP to

withdraw from prosecution in the offences of murder,

Tapemules*| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon‘ble Me, Justice Shahid Khan
therefore, the order of the learned trial Court is not
legally sustainable. He placed reliance on “Syed Aijaz

Hussan Vs. The State” _(1983_P Cr. L J 1741
Karachi).

4. Conversely, the learned counsel representing
the accused respondents opposed the above
contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner and
contended that in view of insufficient evidence, the DPP
has moved the application in accordance with the
relevant provisions of law for discharge of the accused,
therefore, the impugned order may be maintained. He
fortified his view point with “Muhammad Nawaz Khan
Vs. The State” (1990 P Cr. L J 986 Karachi).

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. In essence, the petitioner is aggrieved of
discharge of the accused by learned trial Court on
accepting the application of the District Public
Prosecutor under Section 4(1)(c){ii) of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Prosecution Service (Constitution,
Functions and Powers) Act, 2005 (hereinafter the
Prosecution Act) read with Section 494 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (hereinafter the Code). In
order to know the powers and functions of the DPP
under Section 4(1)(c)(ii) of the Prosecution Act, the said

provision is reproduced herein below.

“4. Powers and Functions of a Public Prosecutor.
(1) A District Public Prosecutor or a Public

Tajamul/Cs* OB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Me, Justice Shahig Khao
Prosecutor, as the case may be, shall be in-charge of
the Prosecution in the district concerned and in
discharge of his lawful duties with respect to a case
the prosecution whereof is lawfully assigned to him,
shall perform the following functions, in relation to
conducting prosecution of offences before courts of
competent jurisdiction, namely: -

(a) safeguard the interest of the public in
prosecution of cases before the courts of
competent jurisdiction;

(b) shall, on receipt of the final report, -

(i) lodge the same before the competent
court trial; or

(ii) withhold the same for want of proper
evidence and return it to the
Investigation Officer with written
direction to resubmit the report after
removal of the deficiencies so identified
by him;

(c) in_respect of compoundable offences, other
than those which are punishable by death
or life imprisonment, the Director General
Prosecution, and in respect of
compoundable_offences_punishable__with
imprisonment for seven_years or less, the

District Public Prosecutor, may
(i) withhold prosecution if reasonable

ground exists to believe that the offence
is compoundable; provided that if the
offence is not compounded within a
period of one month, a report shall be
lodged in the court of competent
jurisdiction for prosecution and trial; or
(ii) apply, for reasons to be recorded in
writing, to the court of competent
jurisdiction for the discharge of the
case, if its institution has been found to
be mala fide, wrongful or weak from
evidentiary point of view:
Provided that an application under
this section shall accompany the final
report under section 173 of the Code:
Provided further that the competent
court may dispose of the application in
such manner as it may deem fit.
(2) In respect of any case instituted by a Public Prosecutor
before a competent court, any private person representing
the complainant shall act under the directions of the

Public Prosecutor”. (emphasis supplied)

The record shows that the accused
respondents have been charged for dual murders of a

married couple which offence is punishable with death

Tapmui/cs*| Da: Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon‘bie Mr, Justice Shehid Khan
as gisas or ta’zir, imprisonment for life or imprisonment
which may extend to twenty-five years as emerging from
the three clauses of Section 302 PPC. It is manifest from
close perusal of clause (c) of the Prosecution Act that no
application can be made for withholding the prosecution
of an accused who is charged with offences punishable
with death or imprisonment for life, hence, the Director
General Prosecution is empowered to move an application
for discharge of an accused who is charged with
compoundable offences punishable with imprisonment
above seven years except the offences punishable with
death or imprisonment for life whereas the DPP can only
move such application for discharge of an accused
indicted with compoundable offences entailing the
punishment of seven years or less. The scheme of the
above provision shows that sub-clauses (i} and (ii) are to
be read in conjunction with the main portion of clause (c)
containing the specification of the powers of Director
General and DPP. In other words, sub-clause (ii) cannot
be read in isolation for the purpose of authorization of the
DPP for withholding prosecution of accused in each and
every case. Thus, it is abundantly clear from clause (b) of
Section 4(1) of the Prosecution Act that the learned DPP
had no powers to request for discharge of the accused
respondents who are charged for commission of the
offence of murders entailing the punishment of death or
imprisonment for life as neither he nor the Director
General Prosecution was authorized to move

application for withdrawal of prosecution of the

Taamut/cs"| DB: Hon’ble Mr. fustice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Me, Justice Shahid Khan
accused respondents in view of the bar contained in the
aforesaid provision. I would fortify my above view with
the judgment of this Court in the case titled “Zaiwar
Khan Vs. Sahib Zada_and_ another” (2018 YLR
2025) wherein it has been observed that:
“District Public Prosecutor is not competent under the
Act ibid either to withhold prosecution or apply to the
Court for discharge of the accused in respect of
offences punishable with death or life imprisonment,
which have specifically been mentioned in the said

clause; even Director General Prosecution cannot
exercise those functions under the law”.

7. No doubt, Section 494, Cr.P.C. is in the field
which empowers the Public Prosecutor to withdraw
from prosecution of accused with consent of the Court
and before the judgement is pronounced but Section 11
of the Prosecution Act gives overriding effect to the said
Act over other laws for the time being in force. The said
provision reads as under:

11. Act to override other laws. The provisions

of this Act shall be enforced notwithstanding

anything repugnant or contrary contained in any
other law for time being in force.

The non-obstante clause has been added to
the above provision in order to uphold its enforceability
over any provision in any other law for the time being
in force which is contradictory or repugnant to it.
Section 494, Cr.P.C. confers the power on any Public
Prosecutor to withdraw from prosecution of an accused
irrespective of the nature of allegations leveled against

him, however, those powers of the Public Prosecutor

have been curtailed by the Prosecution Act. Insertion of

Tala mutjcs| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

‘ble Mr, Justis Nd Kh:
Section 11 in the Prosecution Act manifests the
unambiguous and clear intention of the law makers to
limit the powers enjoyed by the Public Prosecutor
under Section 494, Cr.P.C. Thus, after promulgation of
the Prosecution Act, having the overriding effect on any
other law for the time being enforce, the learned DPP
was debarred to exercise his powers under Section 494,
Cr.P.C. Wisdom is taken from “Messrs Rajby
Industries _Karachi_and_ others Vs. Federation of
Pakistan and others” (2023 SCMR 1407). In the said
case, the Hon’ble apex Court, while highlighting the
meaning and scope of the expression ‘non-obstante’,
observed that said phrase, for all intents and purposes,
invests powers in the legislature to set down any
provision which may have an overriding effect on any
other legal provision under the same law or any other
laws, being a legislative apparatus and method of
conferring overriding effect over the law or provisions
that qualifies such clause or section of law. Likewise,
the Prosecution Act though is a provincial enactment
but it is a special law and it is settled rule that where
there was a conflict between a special law and a general

law, the former would prevail over the latter. Wisdom is

drawn from “Syed Mushahid Shah and others Vs.

Federal Investment Agency and_others” (2017

SCMR_ 1218). Even otherwise, the judicial order is

Tapmuycs| pa: Hon’‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
I thi
revisable by High Court when direction improperly or
arbitrarily exercised by Court. An application moved
under Section 494, Cr.P.C. for withdrawal from
prosecution not made on any ground of public policy or
public peace and interest but merely on grounds
directly related to detailed appreciation of evidence
would tantamount to an attempt to throttle prosecution
and to interfere with ordinary course of justice. While
discussing the scope of Section 494, Cr.P.C. and
supervisory powers of the Courts, the Hon’ble apex
Court observed in the case titled “Mir Hassan Vs.

Tariq Saeed and others” (PLD 1977 S.C 451) that:

It is clear that this supervisory function of the Court
can be exercised only on a consideration of all the facts
and circumstances of the case available to the Court,
and not in disregard of any material factor or
circumstance having a bearing on the issue. At the same
time, it is also clear that in undertaking this exercise the
Court cannot embark upon the kind of detailed analysis
of the evidence which can appropriately be undertaken
only at the conclusion of a judicial trial. Any such
attempt would amount to throttling the prosecution or
interfering with the ordinary course of justice.

In light of the wisdom contained in the afore-

referred dicta, the learned trial Court has committed an
illegality in exercise of its discretion arbitrarily by giving
consent for discharge of the accused on the sole ground
of insufficient evidence. The case law in Muhammad

Nawaz Khan’s case (1990 PCr.LJ_ 1986 Karachi)

supra relied upon by learned counsel for the

Tajamul/Cs* DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
‘ble Mr, fH hy
respondents is not applicable to the present case having
distinguishing background.

8. Even otherwise, in terms of Section 169,
Cr.P.C. recommendation for discharge of an accused is
the sole prerogative of Investigating Officer. When in
light of investigation it appears to Investigating Officer
that the evidence is not sufficient to justify forwarding
of the accused to a Magistrate, he shall release the
accused, if in custody, on his executing a bond for his
appearance before the Magistrate when required.
Section 169, Cr.P.C. reads as under:

169. Release of accused when evidence deficient.---lf,
upon an investigation under this Chapter, it appears to the
officer incharge of the police station or to the police-officer
making the investigation that there is not sufficient
evidence, or reasonable ground or suspicion to justify the
forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate, such officer
shall, if such person is in custody, release him on his
executing a bond, with or without sureties as such officer
may direct, to appear, if and when so required, before a
Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence on
a police report and to try the accused or send him for trial.
In case the Investigating Officer is satisfied

that sufficient evidence is available against the
accused, he shall forward him in terms of Section 170,
Cr.P.C to concerned Magistrate for his trial. In both the
cases either under Section 169 or 170, Cr.P.C. the
Investigating Officer shall submit final report under
Section 173, Cr.P.C. and thereafter it is the sole
domain of the Magistrate to agree or disagree with the

opinion of the Investigating Officer. In view of the

Tajamuticst| oB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Me, Justice Shetid Khan

-10-

powers conferred upon the Investigating Officer for
discharge of the accused or his recommendation for
trial under the aforesaid provisions, no sanctity is
attached to the opinion of Public Prosecutor. In this

regard the judgment in the case titled "Muhammad

Sharif alias Bhuller v. The State" (2008 YLR 1462)

may be referred wherein it has been held that:

“On perusal of report under section 173, Cr.P.C. I have
found that the Investigating Officer concluded that so
many persons appeared before him in defence of the
accused and they stated that Muhammad Shafique
deceased had died his natural death and accused-
petitioner Ashraf was found innocent and
recommended to be placed in Column No.2 of challan,
but thereafter the District Public Prosecutor gave a note
at the end of the report under section 173, Cr.P.C. to
place the name of petitioner-accused in Column No.3,
which, in my considered view, falls out of the purview
of duties assigned to the District Public Prosecutor. As
no legal sanctity is attached to the opinion of District
Public Prosecutor qua the guilt of an accused and it is
always the Court, which is to charge the accused under
the relevant provisions of law keeping in view the
evidence available on record regarding the crime
alleged and not the District Public Prosecutor.
Reference can be had to PLD 1954 Sindh 256. Even no
Court can order to the Investigating Officer to submit
challan while placing the name of the accused in
Column Nos.2, 3 and 4, rather the Court can direct the
Investigating Officer only to submit final report after
completing investigation. Reference can be had to 1983
SCMR 370".

9. The record further shows that the 1.0. has

submitted the final report before the Court for trial of
the accused already arrested but to the contrary, the

learned DPP has submitted the application for

Tajamuiyes*| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-ll-

discharge of the accused. Before submitting the
application for withdrawal from prosecution of the
accused, which was otherwise incompetent, the learned
DPP was bound under sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of
Section 4(1) of the Prosecution Act to withhold the final
report for want of proper evidence and should have
returned it to the 1.0 with directions in writing to
resubmit the report after removal of the deficiencies so
identified by him. Sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) referred
to above is reproduced below for ready perusal.

(ii) withhold the same for want of proper evidence and
return it to the Investigation Officer with written
direction to resubmit the report after removal of
the deficiencies so identified by him;

There is nothing on the record to show any
such effort on the part of the DPP under the above
mandatory provision of giving any directions to the 1.0
for removal of deficiencies or collecting of further
evidence rather he straightaway filed application for
withdrawal of the accused, for which not only he was
not authorized under the law but the application was
otherwise also no warranted in circumstances of the
case.

10. We deem it appropriate to note that the
learned DPP has filed application for discharge of the
arrested accused namely Muhammad Sherin, Amjad Ali
and Mst. Bakht Haram but the impugned order of the

learned trial Court suggests that all the accused

Tajamutses+| DB: Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
on‘ bh if uu in
-12-

including the absconding accused Ubaid Ullah son of
Waris Khan were discharged because no specification
with regard to discharge of the accused except Ubaid
Ullah is emerging from the impugned order. Request of
the I.0 to the Court for proceedings under Section 512,
Cr.P.C. has nothing to do with Section 173, Cr.P.C. nor
any such request of the I.0 can be termed as final
report. Since, there was no final report in consonance
with Section 173, Cr.P.C before the learned trial Court
in respect of absconding accused Ubaid Ullah as
required under the first Proviso to Clause (c) of Section
4(1) of the Prosecution Act, therefore, his discharge by
the learned trial Court along with the remaining
accused, as suggested by the impugned order, was
illegal.

11, In light of what has been discussed, the
impugned order is not legally sustainable. Resultantly,
instant petition is allowed, the impugned order is set
aside and the learned trial Court is directed to proceed

with trial of the accused in accordance with law.
