2. On 21.06.2009 at 2100 hours, complainant

Saleem Khan (PW.13), in company of dead body of his

deceased brother Fida Muhamamd Khan, reported to local

police in Casualty of Topi hospital Swabi, that on the

fateful day he alongwith his deceased brother while

returning from Topi Bazaar, met their uncle Mohabat Khan

(appellant-convict herein), near the house of one Jans Khan,

situated in Mohallah Sana Khel; that the deceased

demanded return of his loan Rs.5,00,000/- from the

appellant, on which he infuriated and give dagger blows to

the deceased one after the other, which resulted into his

death on the spot. Report of the complainant was reduced

into writing in the shape of murasila Exh.PA/1, by Abdul

Mateen ASI (PW.9), on the basis of which FIR No.325

dated 21.06.2009 under section 302 PPC was registered at

Police Station Topi, against the accused. He prepared injury

sheet and inquest report of the deceased Exh.PW.9/1 and

Exh.PW.9/2, and referred his death body to the mortuary

for postmortem examination.

3. Dr. Fazal Qadar SMO (PW.10), conducted

autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on 21.06.2009 at

8.45 p.m. and found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Stab wound 3 x % cm at left medial lower chest
at the level of 8" intercostals space.

2. Stab wound 3 x 4% c.m. on left side of abdomen, 3
c.m. lateral to umbilicus.
Abdomen, walls, peritoneum, small intestine,
damaged.

Walls, pleurae, left lung, pericardium, heart and
blood vessels as well as thorax injured.
Opinion:- According to opinion of the Medical Officer,
death of the deceased occurred due to stab wounds, causing
damage to the heart, left lung, blood vessels and small

intestines.
4. Muhammad Shoaib SI (PW.14), proceeded

to the spot and prepared site plan

Exh.PW.14/1 at the instance of eyewitness/complainant.

During spot inspection, he secured bloodstained earth from

the place attributed to the deceased vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.14/2. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.14/3, he took

into possession an electric tube-light from the spot.

Similarly, vide recovery memo Exh.PW.4/1, he took into

possession the last worn bloodstained attires of the

deceased having cut marks. He sent the bloodstained

clothes and earth to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PK,

initiated proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C.

against the appellant and after completion of investigation,

he handed over case file to SHO, who submitted challan in

terms of $.512 Cr.P.C. against the appellant.

5. On arrest of the appellant, supplementary challan

was submitted against him before the learned Trial Court,

where he was formally charge sheeted, to which he pleaded

not guilty and claimed Trial. To prove its case, prosecution

examined as many as fourteen witnesses. After closure of

the prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant was

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the

prosecution allegations and professed his innocence. He,

however, declined to be examined on oath under section

340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce defence evidence. On

conclusion of trial, the learned Trial Court convicted and

sentenced, as mentioned above.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant-convict while

arguing the case on merits half heartedly, lastly submitted

that keeping in view the extreme old aged of the appellant

as 83 years, non-proof of motive, premeditation and

intention of the appellant to commit the crime coupled with

the fact that what actually happened just before the incident

which at the spur of moment provoked the appellant,

penalty of death awarded by the learned Trial Court to the

appellant, seems to be a harsh one, as such stressed for

reduction of the same. In support of his contention he

placed reliance on case titled, “Muhammad Ishaque

Khan and others Vs the State and others” (PLD 1994

Supreme Court 259), case titled, “Muhammad Tariq Vs

the State” (2003 SCMR 531), this Court judgment in

case titled, “Muhammad Aslam Shah Vs the State”

(PLJ 1993 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 276) (DB), and case titled,

“Nazir Ahmad and another Vs_ the _ State”

(2013 P Cr L J 505).

7. Complainant was afforded an opportunity to

engage a counsel, but he on 28.04.2015, stated at the bar

that being a destitute, he could not engage a counsel,

therefore, would rely on the arguments of learned AAG.

AAG contended that prosecution has proved the guilt of the

appellant up to the hilt through cogent and confidence

inspiring evidence and there is no mitigating circumstance

which may warrant lesser sentence; that mere extreme old

age of the appellant cannot be a ground of awarding lesser

sentence. He while supporting the impugned judgment

sought dismissal of the appeal.

8. We have heard the arguments advanced from

either side and perused the record carefully.

9. Record divulges that complainant Saleem

Khan has directly and singularly charged the appellant for

committing the murder of his nephew Fida Muhammad by

giving him dagger blows on vital parts of his body. The

incident took place at 20.00 hours, which has been reported

with promptitude at 2100 hours i.e. within an hour,

eliminating any possibility of consultation, deliberation and

concoction. Appellant is the real uncle of the complainant

and nothing is on the record even to show previous ill will

of the complainant with the appellant, therefore, it does not

appeal to a prudent mind that he he would let off the real

culprit of murder of his brother by implicating his innocent

real uncle.

10. Saleem Khan complainant while appearing as

PW.13, furnished the ocular account of the incident which

is straightforward, trustworthy and confidence inspiring

supported by medical evidence in the shape of testimony of

the Medical Officer, who conducted autopsy on the dead

body of the deceased, according to which the deceased met

unnatural death because of stab wounds on vital part of his

body, like heart and abdomen. Recovery of blood from

place of the deceased on the spot, his bloodstained garments

having cut marks, coupled with positive Serologist report

Exh.PK qua the bloodstained articles, squarely corroborate

the ocular account. Eyewitness Saleem Khan has been

subjected to taxing and comb searching cross-examination

by a skillful hand, but nothing beneficial to defence could

be extracted from him. He remained stuck on his stance and

defence failed to create any dent in his testimony on any

vital aspect of the incident so as to render his presence on

the spot with the deceased at the time of incident as

doubtful.

11. Moreso, appellant being real uncle of the

deceased, instead of giving shoulder to the “Jinaza” of the

deceased, went into hiding for considerable period,

therefore, his unexplained abscondance, in _ the

circumstances, is another corroborative piece of

circumstantial evidence supporting the direct evidence.

12. In light of the above discussed evidence, we

are firm in our view that it was the appellant who

committed the murder of his deceased nephew Faida

Muhammad by giving him dagger blows, hence, the learned

Trial Court was quite justified by holding him guilty of the

murder. The findings of the learned Trial Court qua guilt of

the appellant being based on proper appreciation of

evidence, is not open to any interference.

13. Now the moot point for determination before

us is what should be the quantum of sentence to meet the

ends of justice. On the face of record, the appellant is an old

man of 83 years and such extreme age can be considered by

itself as an infirmity. Besides, no shred of evidence, much

less tangible, is on record to prove to show the immediate

cause of this untoward incident. As per complainant’s

version deceased and the appellant met by chance on the

way, where the deceased demanded his loan, as a result the

appellant infuriated and give him dagger blows but this

stance of the complainant does not appeal to our mind as on

10

mere demand of a loan, a real uncle cannot be expected to

take the life of his nephew. What actually happened just

little before the incident, which provoked the appellant, has

been suppressed by the complainant. The peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case suggests that on refusal of

demand of loan by the appellant, the deceased might have

exchanged hot words or abusing language with the

appellant, by virtue of which the appellant being the real

uncle of the deceased, might not have controlled his temper

keeping in view the offensive language and disrespectful

conduct of his nephew, which resulted this untoward

incident. There is no evidence to prove that appellant was

specially waiting for the deceased at the place of the

incident having prior plan to do him away. Rather, the

deceased and appellant met by chance on the way; and what

actually happened in a spur of moment, which resulted in

this unfortunate incident, shrouded in mystery. We deem

this as a sufficient mitigating circumstance coupled with

extreme old age of the appellant, for reduction in his

11

sentence. Reliance placed on cases titled, “Muhammad

Ishaque Khan and others Vs The State and others”

(PLD 1994 Supreme Court 259), “Muhammad Tariq Vs

the State” (2003 SCMR 531) and Muhammad Aslam

Shah Vs the State” (PLJ 1993 (Peshawar) 276.

14. For what has been discussed above, we
maintain conviction of the appellant under section 302 (b)
PPC, however, reduce/convert his sentence from penalty of
death to imprisonment for life. The amount of
compensation as awarded by the learned Trial Court shall
remain intact. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to the
appellant.

15. With the above modification in the sentence of

the appellant, this appeal stands dismissed.

16. The murder reference is accordingly answered

in the negative.

Announced.
