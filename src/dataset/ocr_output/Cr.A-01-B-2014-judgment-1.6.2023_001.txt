RRA EEE ERE EERE ERE ERA AK

FAZAL SUBHAN, J.— Through this criminal appeal,

the appellant Zarghoon Shah has challenged the judgment
and order dated 16.12.2013, passed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III, Bannu, whereby accused /respondent
No.2, namely, Zer Muhammad has been acquitted from the

charges.

2. Relevant facts of the case are that on
08.05.1970, the complainant Zarghoon Shah reported that
he along with Gul Mir Shah s/o Piyo Shah, Asal Mir s/o
Ghous Amir and Mohsan Shah, his cousin had gone to

cloth market/ Mandi, Kotka Jumma Khan, for sale of
-2-

clothes and when were busy in their business, at about
11:30 hours, Zer Muhammad (the present respondent)
along with Mir Sahib Shah and Amir Hamza came duly
armed with Rifles/ topaks. Respondent Zer Muhammad
fired at Moeen Shah with his Rifle, who was sitting in the
shop got injured, with this Asal Mir and Ghous Amir
caught up, however, they both were fired by Amir Hamza,
Mir Sahib Shah and Amir Hamza fired upon them with
their respective rifles and as a result he was hit and got
injured. Asal Mir and Moeen Shah tried to catch hold the
accused, but after covering 2 to 5 paces they fell on the
ground. All the three accused announced that, whosoever
came near to them, would face the same consequences,
whereafter accused decamped from the spot of occurrence.
Motive for the occurrence was stated to be a land dispute
which they had purchased, some 15/20 days back, which
was earlier mortgaged with all the three accused, which
annoyed the accused party, he, therefore, charged the
accused for firing and causing injuries to the above

injured.

3. The injured were then shifted to the hospital,
where they were provided medical treatment and at the
same time, Doctor Ghulam Farid Khan medical Officer

also recorded his statement, already on file. The injured
-3-

Asal Mir and Moeen Shah later on succumbed to their
injuries and their Postmortem was conducted. After
completion of investigation in the case challan was
submitted against the arrested accused Noor Sahib Shah
and Mir Hamza, who thereafter faced their trial in the case
and vide judgment dated 17.08.1970, the then learned
Sessions Judge, Derajat Division, Camp Bannu, while
arriving to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to
prove its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt

extended benefit of doubt to them and were acquitted.

4. The respondent Zer Muhammad was arrested
vide Naqal Mad No.30, dated 22.01.2013, and after
completion of investigation challan was submitted against

them.

5. On submission of challan, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu, summoned the
accused from jail, where after proceedings under section
265- C Cr.PC were complied and charge was framed to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
prove its case the prosecution examined Doctor Faizuddin
Qazi, SMO, as PW-01, who deposed that the injured was
examined by doctor Ghulam Farid Khan (Late) and he also
conducted their post mortem examination. The said

medical officer had also recorded dying declaration of two
-4-

injured Moeen Shah Ex: PD/4 and dying declaration of
deceased Asal Mir Ex: PD/S. On the request of prosecution
the statement of Doctor Ghulam Farid (Late) was
transferred from the previous trial into the trial of present
respondent. Similarly, on the request of prosecution the
statements of PWs , Ghulam Daud, Saadullah Khan
Judicial Magistrate-, D.I-Khan, Muhammad Aleem Rtd,
Patwari and Mehrul Wahab Khan SI, Ghosa Mir, Gul
Nawaz, Mir Qalam Khan FC No.158, Sattar Jan ?SI and
Sadiq Ali shah SI, recorded in the earlier trial, as Ex: PW
4/2 to PW 4/12 were also transferred to the present trial on
the ground that the said PWs were died and accordingly
the trial court transferred their statements to the present
trial. Thereafter state of eye-witness namely Zarghoon
Shah and Gul Mir Shah were recorded as PW-02 and PW-
03, respectively, while statement of Mehran Shah Khan
and Muhammad Aslam Khan S.H.O were recorded,
whereafter prosecution closed its evidence. learned trial
Court recorded statement of accused under section 342
Cr.PC, wherein he professed innocence and false
implication, however, he did not opt to produce defence
evidence or to be examined on oath as provided under
section 340(2) Cr.PC. learned trial Court after hearing

arguments of learned counsel for the parties, vide
-5-

impugned judgment acquitted the accused/ respondents.

Hence, the instant criminal appeal.

6. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Asstt: Advocate General were heard at length and with

their valuable assistance the record was gone through.

7. It is on the record that as a result of firing by
all the accused including accused facing trial, Asal Mir and
Moeen Shah sustained injuries, whereafter they were
shifted to the hospital for treatment. It is in the statement
of PW Doctor, Ghulam Farid that he not only provided
treatment to the injured, but also recorded their statements
Ex: PD/4 and Ex: PD/S. To accept dying declaration there
are certain preconditions which includes the factum that
the injured must have apprehension of immediate death
and that the person in whose presence dying declaration is
recorded must endorse that the person recording his dying
declaration is in proper senses and is able to talk and
communicate and could give true and complete account of
the incident. In this case the dying declaration was
recorded by the PW doctor Ghulam Farid Khan, medical
officer, Civil Hospital, Bannu and therefore, he qualify the
criteria to declare that the injured at the relevant time was
in proper senses and was capable to make his statement

clearly and give complete account of the incident, hence,
-6-

his credibility to record dying declaration cannot be
questioned, however, it is clear from the statement that the
then injured recorded his statement before the Medical
Officer in Pashto language and Dr. Ghulam Farid recorded
his statement in English. He admitted that deceased Moin
Shah told him that he did not “know” the names of other
accused, who accompanied the accused facing trial Zer
Muhammad and that he first wrote the word “know”, but
thereafter he strike down the word “know” and substituted
the word “remember” because according to his mind the
word “remember” conveys the proper meaning of the
statement made by the said injured (deceased) in Pashto.
Similarly said Medical Officer admitted that he has not
mentioned father name of the deceased Asal Mir and that
is why he has not written his father name at the time of
recording his dying declaration. From the statement of PW
Dr. Ghulam Farid, it is clear that he was changing the
words which at his own whims and wishes. The word
‘Know, convey a totally different meaning as compared to
the word “remember” and if a person do not know any
fact, it would mean that he had no knowledge in respect of
the said fact, whereas “did not remember” means that the
person know about the fact, but at the time of recording his
statement he forget the said fact. In this view of the matter

we are of the view that though PW-01, Dr. Ghulam Farid
-7-

was competent to record dying declaration of the then
injured (deceased), but the way/manner he recorded
‘translated statement creates doubt and hence, said dying

declaration cannot be accepted to be correct.

8. Besides the above fact there is contradictions
with record to the presence of other persons at the time of
recording of dying declaration of the above mentioned
injured/ deceased. Admittedly one Mir Qalam FC
accompanied the two injured, but subsequently PW Dr.
Ghulam Farid negated as to whether the injured brought to
the hospital by Mir Qalam FC or not. The said medical
Officer also affirmed that two injured persons were
accompanied by their relatives, whereas PW Zarghoon
Shah in his cross-examination has stated that at the
relevant time of recording dying declaration of the then
injured no one was present with them. The cross-
examination of Dr. Ghulam Farid further reveals that Asal
Mir was literate, but he could not signed dying declaration
due to injuries which has caused shock as well, this answer
to the question further brings a cloud of doubt on the dying
declaration for the reason that if the injured Asal Mir was
in shock then how he could record his dying declaration.
He further admitted that, while recording dying declaration

of the injured Moeen Shah he did not knew names of two
-8-

other assailants, who accompanied Zer Muhammad present
respondent. From the above, it is further clear that there
are certain doubts about dying declaration recoded by the

PW Dr. Ghulam Farid.

9. In the initial report, the complainant Zarghoon
Shah has reported that all the three accused were armed
with Rifles (Topaks), however, when examined in the
Court he made improvement by replying that the accused
were armed with single barrel shotgun known as Kohati
Topak, similarly reply was given by PW Gul Mir Shah in
respect of kind of weapon, this clearly indicates that both
these witnesses have made willful improvements in respect

of kind of weapon allegedly used in the offence.

10. So far as ocular account of the case is
concerned PW Zarghoon Shah and PW Gul Mir Shah
presented themselves as eye-witnesses of the case, but on
thorough analysis it is clear that both these witnesses were
inconsistent on many aspects of the case. PW Zarghon
Shah in cross-examination replied that they, at the relevant
time, were standing in front of their Chappar shop, but
added that they were inside the Chappar shop. As
discussed above, no description of the weapon was given
in the F.IL.R by PW Zarghoon Shah, but in his statement he

has given the description by answering that it was Kohati
-9-

Topak. As per his reply after receiving fire shot the
injured Asal Mir and Moeen Shah got up and ran away out
of the shop, but fell down after covering 5/6 paces,
however, the Investigating Officer did not recover or
mention anything about trail of blood from the spot where
he received fire shot and the place where they fell on the

ground.

11. PW Zarghoon further admitted that accused
did not fire upon him or at PW Gul Mir Shah. Admittedly
the occurrence has taken place on Friday Mandi and as per
site-plan the said Mandi was surrounded by Walls having
numerous Chappar shops, none of them came forward to
depose regarding the occurrence, no independent and
disinterested evidence come up on the record to support

the prosecution case.

12. In respect of the presence of customers both
these witnesses have contradicted each other. It is also on
record that one Ghulam Daud had also visited the spot, but
PW Gul Mir Shah had contradicted by saying that at the
relevant time said Gulam Daud had not seen the assailants
decamping from the spot. In cross-examination PW Gul
Mir Shah further reveals that another person had also
received pellet injuries and had gone to the hospital,

however, the prosecution has concealed the injuries
-10-

sustained by such person, who admittedly was sitting
outside the shop. Thus from the statement of these
witnesses it is doubtful as to whether they are actually
present and had seen the entire occurrence, when the
alleged eye-witnesses are closely related to the deceased
and at the same time are inimical to the accused party,
while in such a situation an independent corroboration is
always required to believe the interested eye-witness,
however, in the present case no such corroboration is

available to support the statements of these eye-witnesses.

In the case of “Abid Ali and 2 others Vs the
States” (2011 SCMR 208) the august Supreme Court has

held that:

“We have thoroughly discussed the
statements of two eye-witnesses claiming
to be present at the scene of crime but
they on their own admissions were chance
witnesses and have admitted their enmity
with the appellants. Both these witnesses
could not reasonably explain their
presence with the deceased Muhammad
Azam rather their conduct runs against
the natural behaviour of normal human,

therefore, their testimonies appears to be
-ll-

unbelievable in the circumstances of the

case.”

13. So far, motive aspect of the case is concerned
PW Zarghoon Shah has admitted that the transfer of
property through mutation of the land, which become bone
of contention between the parties, was attested in his name
and in the name of Gul Mir Shah PW, and father of Moeen
Shah and that the names of Moeen Shah and Asal Mir
(deceased) was not entered in the mutation of the land in
dispute. Surprisingly the person, who allegedly attacked
and murdered were not beneficiaries of the transfer
mutation, whereas the complainant Zarghoon Shah and
PW Gul Mir Shah to whom the property was transferred
were not fired at, which further creates doubt about the
motive of the occurrence. It is further noticeable that both
the parties belong to the same village i.e. Warana, district
Karak, and admittedly the complainant party visit their
village twice in a month, then it does not appeal to prudent
mind that why the respondent/ accused chose to commit
the offence in the presence of large number of people in
Jumma Bazar, while they could have achieved their target

much easier in their village.

14. From reappraisal of the entire evidence and

record, we have no doubt in our mind that prosecution has
-12-

badly failed to prove its case against the respondent Zer
Muhammad through cogent, convincing and confidence
inspiring evidence and, therefore, trial court after
extending benefit of doubt to the accused was correct in

acquitting the respondent in the case.

In the case of “Muhammad Akram Vs State”

(2009 SCMR 2360), it was held that:

“It is an axiomatic principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof must
accrue in favour of the accused as matter
of right and not of grace. It was observed
by this Court in the case of Tariq Pervez v.
The State 1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving
the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary
that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is circumstance
which created reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused would be entitled
to the benefit of doubt not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of

right.”
-13-

15. No illegality, irregularity, mis-reading or non-
reading of evidence is shown in the impugned judgment,

hence, this criminal appeal being meritless, stands

dismissed.
