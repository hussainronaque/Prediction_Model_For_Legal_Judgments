Cr.A No.108-M/2015.
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 02.11.2015.

Appellants (Muhammad Shah Khesro & Gul Muhammad)

by M/s Syed Abdul Hag & Aurangzeb Advocates.

Respondents (State etc) by Mr.Faheem Naeem Advocate as

State Counsel.

MUHAMMAD DAUD KHAN, J.- Through this single
judgment, I intend to dispose of instant appeal (Cr.A No.108-
M/2015) filed by Muhammad Shah Khisro and connected Cr.A
No.112/2015, filed by Gul Muhammad, as both the appeals are
directed against one and same Judgment dated 27.5.2015, passed
by learned trial Court, whereby both the appellants involved in
case FIR No.517 dated 26.5.2013 u/s 5/6 Explosive Substances
Act, Police Station Timergara, were convicted and sentenced to
undergo SI for five years each.

2. According to the prosecution case, the local police
during Nakabandi intercepted Datsun bearing No.SWA-60151,
being driven by the appellant/convict Gul Muhammad, the search
of which led to the recovery of 400 meters safety fuse, 200
detonators and 150 dynamite sticks from the same, for which the
appellant/convict failed to produce any permit or license.

Consequently the above explosive materials alongwith Datsun
were taken into possession and a case vide FIR mentioned above
was registered. During investigation, the arrested appellant also
implicated Muhammad Shah Khisro(appellant/convict) and
Zabih Ullah (now absconding) in the case as accused.

3. After completion of investigation, challan against
all the accused submitted in the trial Court, where after framing
of formal charge against the accused, the prosecution examined
as many as 9 witnesses. At conclusion of trial, both the appellants
were convicted and sentenced through impugned judgment
whereas co-accused Zabih Ullah was declared Proclaimed
Offender as during trial he remained fugitive from law. Hence
both the appellants approached this Court by filing the instant
appeal as well as connected appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. So far as the case of appellant/convict Gul
Muhammad is concerned, though he was caught red handed
while transporting huge quantity of explosive materials in his
Datsun, but in his confessional statement recorded u/s 164/364
Cr.PC, he totally denied the knowledge of any explosive material
concealed in the bags, which were handed over to him by the
absconding co-accused for taking it to the appellant Muhammad
Shah Khisro. The said statement cannot be treated as
confessional statement because the appellant has not admitted his
conscious knowledge regarding concealing of the explosive in
the bags recovered from his Datsun. For the sake of arguments if

it is presumed that it is a confessional statement, even then it has
no weight as the same has been recorded after remaining in
police custody for three days and there is every possibility of
having been persuaded by police by coercion, inducement or
torture to give the confessional statement, therefore, the same
cannot be made basis for conviction. Besides, as per cross
examination of PW.1, the appellant Gul Muhammad after arrest
was taken by Security Forces/ Army for investigation, who
remained with them for 3/4 hours, so when a person remains first
in the Army interrogation for some time and thereafter in the
police interrogation, then confession of that person is not a big
problem. It is pertinent to mention here that two days custody of
the accused till 29.5.2013 was granted to the PW.1(First
Investigation Officer) but as per PW.6, who also conducted
investigation in the case, on the pointation of appellant Gul
Muhammad, further two bags of explosive powder were
recovered from the said datsun on 28.5.2013, who prepared
pointation memo, recovery memo and _ conducted other
proceedings in the instant case. It means that after custody of
Army officials, the appellant was under investigation of PW.1 till
29.5.2013 but surprisingly PW.6 disclosing himself as I.O, on
28.5.2013, effected further recovery from the datsun on the
pointation of appellant. So it is not clear as to under whose
custody the appellant remained during that period as on
29.5.2013, he was produced for confessional statement before the
Court. The above assertions shows that the appellant was under

interrogation/investigation of several officials, who were turn by
turn shifting/throwing him to each other like a Football and after
getting the desired result, the appellant was produced before the
Court for recording confessional statement. No doubt, the
conviction can be based on the retracted confession alone but if it
is found voluntary, true and confidence inspiring. In Aala
Muhammad and another's case reported in 2008 SCMR 649 it
has been held that:--

"Retracted judicial confession should not be acted upon,
unless corroborated by some other reliable evidence."
6. It is also surprising that the first 1.O/complainant
started investigation at his own after drafting the murasila
without assigning to him by his highups. The other I.O, has also
not been mentioned in the FIR regarding investigation in the
matter, who in his cross examination admitted that it is not
mentioned in the FIR that to whom the investigation of the case
was entrusted. He added that he was orally directed by the
highups for conducting investigation in the case and it is not
necessary to be entrusted in writing. Such act of both the
Investigation Officers, creates doubt regarding mode and manner
of recovery advanced by the prosecution.
7. Admittedly in the instant case Khaista Khan ASI
(PW.1) acted as complainant, witness, and Investigating Officer.
Under the law, complainant and accused are two opponent
parties. In other words, they are two contesting parties. Role of
an Investigating Officer is of a neutral authority whose object is

to unearth the truth. The Investigating Officer cannot be a part or
a member of a party in a case which he is investigating. In this
regard, guidance may be sought from Chapter 25 of Investigation
from Police Rules, 1934. Rule 25.2(3) reads as under:---

"It is the duty of an Investigating Officer to find
out the truth of the matter under investigation.
His object shall be to discover the actual facts of
the case and to arrest the real offender or
offenders. He _ shall not commit himself
prematurely to any view of the facts for or against

any person."

The language of Rule 25.2 above noted clearly
requires of an Investigating Officer not to commit himself
prematurely to any view of the facts for or against any person.
This cannot be expected from an Investigating Officer who
himself is a party. As a matter of fact, concept of honest
investigation is based on non-partisanship and neutrality. The
reason and spirit of separating investigation wing from the
operation wing of police also emanates from the same fact which
reflects in Article 18 of the Police Order, 2002, therefore, this
Court feels that element of honest, transparent and fair
investigation lacks in the instant case. Reliance is placed on 2009
P.Cr.L.J, 1334. The same point has been discussed by the
learned Sindh High Court reported in Nazir Ahmad v. The State
PLD 2009 Kar. 191. The Honourable Supreme Court has
analyzed the above point from another angle also. According to
the Honourable Supreme Court, Investigating Officer is an

important witness for the defence also and in case he acts as a
complainant and raiding officer, the defence is deprived of his
very precious right at the same time and is forced not to depend
upon the same. The Federal Shariat Court also observed that such
an investigation is biased investigation. (Ashiq alias Kaloo v.
State 1989 PCr.LJ 601). In State v. Bashir_and others 1998
SC 408, the Honourable Supreme Court observed that

"as observed above, Investigating Officer is

as important witness for the defence also

and in case the head of the police party

also becomes the Investigating Officer, he

may not be able to discharge his duties as

required of him under the Police Rules".
8. As per assertion PW.6, the other recovery of
explosive materials was made on the pointation of appellant Gul
Muhammad from his Datsun but in respect of the said recovery,
no formal charge has been framed against the appellant by the
learned trial Court and only to the extent of initial recovery,
formal charge has been framed, creating doubt in the prosecution
case.
9. The prosecution witnesses are also not consistent
on material points. According to PW.1, he prepared the site plan
at the instance of eye witnesses but according to PW.2 (eye
witness), the site plan has not been prepared at his instance.
PW.1 asserts that he took 30 minutes on preparation of murasila
and recovery memo whereas PW.2 states that 10/15 minutes
were consumed on the same. According to PW.1, he measured

the safety fuse with measurement tap(feetha) while as per PW.2,
no such measurement has been conducted by the PW.1. As per
stance of PW.6, the explosive were sealed by him but during his
examination in the Court, on opening of two bags on the order of
trial Court, it was found unsealed. The said witness also deposed
that the latter recovery was made on the day of first recovery of
explosive however he again stated that it was made on 28.5.2015.
PW.6 stated that further recovery was effected at 'Maspakheen
Velaâ€™ whereas according to PW.8, the same was effected at 9/10
AM. According to PW.1, there are separate Check Posts of Army
personnel and police at some distance from each other whereas
PW.2 asserts that Army and police officials are standing together
on the Checkpost. PW.1 who after drafting murasila, started
investigation without assigning to him, did not bother to record
statements of any Army official who were present at the relevant
time.

10. The samples from explosive material earlier
recovered were sent to the BDU, Special Branch KPK, Peshawar
on 28.4.2013, which date is more than one month prior to the
present occurrence as the present occurrence has taken place on
26.5.2013, but in the application Ex.PW.6/4, the date of FIR is
written as 26.4.2013 and beneath the signature of scriber, date
28.4.2013 has been mentioned, which shows that the sample sent
to the BDU were not of present case rather it was of another
criminal case registered one month prior to the recovery, and
arrest of present appellants, creating doubt in the prosecution

case. Besides, in the reports Ex.PW.6/10 and Ex.PW.6/17, the
date of its receiving has not been mentioned however, it was
examined on 17.6.2013, which also creates doubt as to in whose
custody, it was lying during this period nor any statement of
concerned official in this regard has been recorded. This
controversy could have been resolved by examining the Bomb
Disposal Expert but the prosecution did not bother to examine
Khanzada ASI, who had examined the referred explosive in the
BDU, which shows lack of interest of prosecution in the matter.
In the absence of date of receipt of samples in the BDU, and non-
production of Expert, the said report has got no weight and on the
basis of such report accused cannot be convicted. The
prosecution was bound to prove the recovery of alleged explosive
material by producing the Expert etc but they did not bother to do
so for the reason best known to them.

11. The CDR data collected by the prosecution could
not establish any link of the appellants with each other as
according to PW.6 he had not pointed out in the CDR about any
contacts of the appellants and that he has not annexed any CNIC
of the appellants or any record on which the SIMs were
registered. The CDR data has also not been exhibited during trial
which could support the prosecution case and only it has been
placed on file just to strengthen the fake prosecution case. PW.1
asserts in his cross examination that as per his investigation,
appellant Gul Muhammad being Taxi driver used to take goods
of people from lower area to upper area for which a good amount

was paid to him. He added that according to his investigation,
accused is not previously involved in any terrorist or illegal
activities. The record is also silent regarding any contact of the
appellants with any Terrorist Organization or Taliban etc. There
is also nothing available on file as to whether the appellants are
dangerous, hardened or desperate criminals.

12. As per PW.2, the vehicle of appellant was signaled
by the Constable Farman whereas Constable Irshad had
conducted search of the vehicle but surprisingly both the witness
have not been examined by the prosecution in order to strengthen
the prosecution case rather they were abandoned by the
prosecution being won over. Non-production of such material
witnesses further makes the story of prosecution dubious. It is
well-settled principle of law that if a best piece of evidence is
available with a party and the same is withheld by him, then it is
presumed that the party has some evil motive behind it in not
producing the said evidence. Even otherwise, a presumption
under illustration (g) to Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order

can fairly be drawn in the matter. Reliance is placed on the case

of Darwesh & others Vs The State (2014 YLR 2233).

13. The Datsun from which the alleged explosive
materials were recovered, has not been produced in the trial
Court for exhibition and non production of case property throws
doubt on the credential of the prosecution story, which has
rendered the foundation of the case shaky, on the basis of which

conviction and sentence passed by trial cannot be sustained.
10

Reliance is placed on the case of Said Muhammad Vs The State
reported in 2009 P.Cr.L.J 604.

14. Apart from the above, Muhammad Rasool, the
father of appellant Muhammad Shah Khisro, produced the
license and other documents Ex.PW.6/13 renewed upto 4.6.2015,
to the ILO, regarding Drill Machine installed in his shop,
according to which they were allowed to possess small quantity
of explosive for own use. Besides, no private person has been
associated to the recovery proceedings which is clear violation of
mandatory provision of Section 103 Cr.PC, though as per
prosecution witnesses, there were shops at some distance and
Army officials were also present with them but they did not
bother to associate any of the person from the public nor any
effort was made for the same. The prosecution was bound to
prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt against the appellant
which they failed to do so, the benefit of which must go to the
appellant.

15. So far as the appellant/convict Muhammad Shah
Khisro is concerned, admittedly there is nothing on record
against him except the exculpatory confessional statement of co-
appellant which was also not proved by the prosecution. No
recovery has been made from the immediate possession of the
appellant or at his instance. Besides, in the light of above
material contradictions of prosecution witnesses as well as loop
holes in the prosecution case, the conviction and sentence of

appellant Muhammad Shah Khisro is also liable to be set aside.
11

In view of what has been observed above, the
prosecution case is full of doubt and material contradictions the
benefit of which would go to the accused as it is settled law that
for creating doubt single circumstance is sufficient and not many
circumstances are required. Therefore, the prosecution has badly
failed to prove its case against the appellants beyond shadow of
reasonable doubt and the learned trial Court has not appreciated
the prosecution evidence in its true perspective and has erred in
convicting the appellants vide impugned judgment which cannot
be held intact. Resultantly, the instant Criminal Appeal and
connected Appeal are allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside and both the appellants are acquitted of the charges leveled
against them. They are in custody, be released forthwith if not
wanted in any other case.

These are reasons of my short order of even date.
