Mr.Sardar
Ali Shah APG.
 
Date of hearing            :         19.04.2016
 
 
                                       ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:- Through captioned pre-arrest bail
application, applicant Barkat Mari has impugned order dated 29.09.2015, passed
by the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Gambat, whereby his earlier
bail application was declined.
2.      Relevant
facts spelt out from instant application are that complainant lodged instant F.I.R.
stating that parties are disputed over landed property. On 28.11.2014, at about
3.00 p.m. accused persons namely Barkat armed with TT pistol, Suhno, Muhammad
Murad and Zahid, Dhani Bux with guns and Khan Muhammad with lathi intercepted
complainant party and on instigation of accused Khan Muhammad, accused Barkat made
pistol fire shot and complainant sustained bullet injury on his left side of
jaw, while accused Suhno caused gun fire and Allah Dino sustained pellet injury
on his back side.
3.      Learned
counsel for applicant contended that applicant is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in the instant case  by the complainant as party are disputed over
landed property     and matrimonial affairs, as they are residing in same
village and belonging to same caste; that alleged incident occurred on
28.11.2014, but complainant lodged the FIR with the delay of  8 months; that applicant
allegedly caused one injury to the complainant but did not repeat pistol fire;
that applicant is behind the bars for about 11 months but prosecution has
failed to examine a single witness against the applicant; that place of
incident is a thickly populated area and no independent person has been cited
as witness and all the PWs are close relatives of complainant; that all
co-accused have been granted bail by the learned trial Court. Learned counsel relied
on the case of Aziz and 2 others v. The State (2007 P.Cr.L.J 299) and Muhammad
Rafique and another v. The State (2015 Y L R 896).
4.      Learned
APG has produced criminal record of the applicant, which is taken on record,
and he further submitted that applicant remained involved in 35 criminal cases,
but was not convicted in any case. However, considering the period of detention
of applicant, he extended no objection for grant of bail.
5.      Heard
arguments advanced by learned counsel for applicant, learned APG and perused
the material available on record carefully, which emanates that alleged
incident was occurred on 28.11.2014, and complainant obtained letter for
medical treatment from police station but he did not lodge F.I.R. instantly
against accused persons and registered the same on 16.07.2015 with the delay of
8 months for which no        plausible explanation. The stance taken by the
complainant is not convincing the prudent mind that after the incident accused
persons approached him for private faisla and they kept him on hopes and ultimately
refused to resolve their dispute through faisla on 25.06.2015, but even then he
registered F.I.R. with the delay of 21 days. Moreover, the place of incident is
situated in a thickly populated area but none independent person form the
vicinity was associated as witness of the incident which also necessitates
serious consideration to thresh out the truth.
6.      The
averments of F.I.R. reflect that parties are belonging to same caste of Mari
and residing in same village and their animosity is going on over the purchase
of one Jareb land. Allegedly, applicant made one pistol fire upon the
complainant but he did not repeat the same though complainant was empty handed
and entirely at the mercy of accused. Per medical report the injury caused to
the complainant falls within the definition Shajjah-i-Hashimah as provided in
S.337-F(v), PPC which is punishable for five years and in such nature cases
bail is granted as a rule. Reliance is placed on the case of Tariq Bashir v.
The State (PLD 1995 SC 34). The allegations for attempt to commit murder in
absence of repetition of subsequent attempt by the accused require further probe
 which can only be crystallized by the learned trial Court by recording the
evidence of PWs. In the case of Umer Hayat v. The State (2008 SCMR 1621), the
honourable Supreme Court has observed that accused had allegedly fired 4/5
shots from his pistol on complainant; out of them one fire hit on his left
knee. Said injury fell within the ambit of S.337-F(v), P.P.C. Accused had
rightly been granted bail by Trial Court and High Court while cancelling the
same had failed to observe whether bail granting order was arbitrary, capricious
or fanciful. Petition for leave to appeal was converted into appeal and accused
was granted bail in circumstances. In the case of Jan Muhammad v. Haji Noor
Jamal and another (1998 SCMR 500), the honourable Supreme Court has observed
that case against accused in the light of the provisions contained in S.334,
P.P.C. read with S.337, P.P.C. did not fall within the prohibitory clause of
S.497(1), Cr.P.C. Petition for leave to appeal was converted into appeal and accused
was released on bail accordingly. 
7.      After
completion of investigation, Challan has been submitted and applicant is no
more required for investigation, thus his further detention will serve any
useful purpose. Moreover, applicant is behind the bars for a period of more
than 08 months but prosecution has failed to examine a single witness to prove
the allegations against him, which reflects that complainant is not interested
to proceed with the case and he wants to keep the applicant behind the bar only,
while rest of accused have been enlarged on bail by the learned trial Court
including accused Suhno who made gunshot and PW Allah Dino sustained pellet
injury on his back. 
8.      Considering
the above circumstances referred supra,  applicant has succeeded to make out a
case for grant of bail on the score of further enquiry as contemplated u/s
497(2), Cr.P.C. However, considering the criminal record of applicant, he is
enlarged on bail subject to his furnishing two solvent sureties in the sum of
Rs.100,000/- each and P.R Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned trial Court. 
8.      The
observations made supra are tentative in nature and shall not influence upon
the merits of the case and learned trial Court shall decide the case purely on
its merits.
