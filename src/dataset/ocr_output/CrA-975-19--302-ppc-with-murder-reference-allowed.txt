SM ATTIQUE SHAH, J:-Through instant criminal
appeal filed under Section 410 Cr.PC, the appellant Fazal
Dayan alias Fazal Gujjar has challenged the impugned
judgment dated 20.07.2019, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Peshawar; whereby
appellant involved in case FIR No.1205 dated 23.05.2016
under Sections 302/34/109 PPC, Police Station Faqir
Abad, Peshawar, was convicted under Section 302(b)/34
PPC as Tazir and sentenced to death alongwith

Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation to the legal heirs(if any)
of the deceased under Section 544-A Cr.PC, for causing
death to Ali Shah and in default of compensation, he shall
suffer Simple Imprisonment for six months. The
compensation amount shall be recoverable as an arrear of
land revenue. He shall be hanged by the neck till declared
dead; subject to confirmation by this Court. Benefit of
Section 382-B  Cr.PC was’ extended to _ the
appellant/convict.

2. As per. prosecution case, Ali Shah
(transgender) was present on the spot; when in the
meanwhile, appellant alongwith three unknown accused,
came there and; appellant started firing at him, as a result
of which he sustained injuries. He was shifted to the LRH,
Peshawar; where in injured condition he reported the
matter to the local police present at casualty LRH,
Peshawar; on the basis of his report, initially FIR was
registered under Section 324 PPC. However, after death of
complainant, section of law was altered to Section 302
PPC. Lateron, co-accused Rehmat Ullah was. also
nominated as accused in the instant case.

3. After completion of investigation, complete

challan against accused was submitted before the learned
trial Court; where after framing of formal charge against
appellant as well as co-accused Rehmat Ullah, the
prosecution in support of its case, examined as many as 12
PWs. On close of prosecution evidence, statements of
accused under Section 342 Cr.PC were recorded; wherein
they denied the allegations levelled against them;
however, they did not opt to be examined on oath under
Section 340(2) Cr.PC or to produce defence evidence.
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, the learned
trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant/ convict
vide impugned judgment dated 20.07.2019; whereas co-
accused Rehmat Ullah was acquitted from the charges
levelled against them. Hence instant criminal appeal has
been filed by the appellant/convict while Murder
Reference No.38-P/2019 was sent by learned trial Court

for confirmation of death sentence awarded to the

appellant/convict.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. The contents of murasila Ex.PW.4/1 depicts

that occurrence has taken place at 11.00 PM; but no
source of light has been disclosed by deceased then

injured in his report; that how he identified the accused in
a pitch dark; where no source of light was available. The
entire case of prosecution is based upon dying declaration
of complainant as well as recovery of crime pistol from
possession of appellant; which had allegedly been
matched with three empties of .30 bore recovered from
the spot as per FSL report. No doubt dying declaration is a
valuable piece of evidence made by a person in the
extremity when he/ she is at the point of death and every
hope of survival has vanished. Since the deponent cannot
be subjected to cross examination; therefore, close
scrutiny of dying declaration should be made so as to
ascertain its reliability and; therefore, before taking such
statement into consideration the Court in order to satisfy
itself regarding fitness of mind of deceased then injured,
shall look into the medical opinion. Besides, it has been
laid down by superior Court that dying declaration by
itself is sufficient to sustain conviction thereon; provided
following conditions are fulfilled:- (i) Whether there was no
chance of mistaken identity? (ii) Whether deceased was
capable of making statement? (iii)After how-long time after
sustaining injury deceased made statement? (iv)Whether

statement rings true? (v)Whether it was free from
promptness of outside? (vi) Whether deceased was a man of
questionable character?

6. So far as identification of accused by deceased
then injured is concerned, admittedly no source of light
has been mentioned by deceased then injured in his
report; besides no bulb or tube-light has been taken into
possession by local police from the spot; being lit at the
time of occurrence; which fact was duly affirmed by PW.4
Qadar Shah ASI; who incorporated the report of deceased
then injured into murasila Ex.PW.4/1; by stating that no
source of light has been shown in the murasila. Likewise,
PW.3 Naveed Khan ASI; who partially investigated the
case and; prepared site plan Ex.PW.3/1 in the case; has
denied recovery of any bulb from the spot; rather stated
that he prepared site plan through torch light; however, he
failed to mention this fact in the headnote of the site plan;
meaning thereby that at the time of occurrence, it was
pitch dark and; identification of actual culprit in absence
of any light, was not possible.

7. Coming to the question as to whether
deceased then injured was capable of making statement at

relevant time, it is not established that who brought the
deceased to the hospital. Murasila is silent qua person;
who brought the complainant to the hospital; however, as
per PW.4, the complainant was brought by a passerby; but
neither name of said passerby has been mentioned nor
was he examined by local police in support of its case.
Likewise, Farzana Riaz (PW.7-A), who being transgender
and friend of complainant; introduced himself to be
present with the complainant at the time of report and
also thumb impressed the said report being rider of the
same; but the murasila does not bear any other thumb
impression except that of alleged deceased then injured.
Though as per PW.4, complainant was in well oriented
condition at the time of report; but as per statement of
PW.7-A; when he reached the hospital, Ali Shah was in
Operation Theater and; after laparotomy as well as
becoming conscious, complainant reported the matter to
the local police in her presence. Had he/she been present
at time of report in casualty LRH, Peshawar, she would
have been mentioned as rider of the same; but neither
scriber of murasila nor the Investigation Officer has shown
him present at the time of report. Even PW.3, who

conducted partial investigation, has deposed that when he
went to LRH, Peshawar, the deceased then injured was
unconscious and; was not capable of giving statement that
is why his statement was not recorded at that time. His
assertion was further affirmed by PW.6 Dr.Anwar Ahmad;
who initially examined the deceased then injured; by
stating that complainant received in casualty LRH,
Peshawar at 22.41 hours in semi conscious condition
through casualty slip Ex.PW.6/1; which assertion not only
smashes the report Ex.PW.4/1 of complainant; whereby
time of occurrence has been shown as 11.00 PM; but also
the depositions of PW.4 and PW.7-A; as according to him,
complainant was in shock and sufficient amount of blood
might have been lost and; at the time of examination, the
patient was not responding to his questions being in
shock. Had the occurrence had taken place at 11.00 PM,
then how the deceased then injured was received in the
hospital at 22.40 PM, prior to the alleged occurrence,
creating doubt qua authenticity of alleged dying
declaration as well as the mode and manner of the
occurrence. All the witnesses are only at one page qua
oozing of sufficient blood from the deceased then injured;

due to which there was possibility of going in shock of
complainant as well as incapability of making his
statement. In light of above, it can be presumed that the
deceased was done to death by some unknown persons
prior to 22.40 hours and subsequently on arrival of PW.7-
A, the alleged dying declaration was manipulated at his
behest; thereby nominating the accused in instant case on
the basis of previous motive of ill-will of appellant with the
deceased. No doubt dying declaration is a strong piece of
evidence but such evidence could only be believed when it
comes through mouth of independent and uninterested
witnesses; whose credibility and impartiality was
otherwise, not questioned; but in instant case no such
independent witness had come forward to lend
corroboration to such piece of evidence; therefore, the
said statement/ dying declaration does not ring true.
Moreover, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case

titled “Mst. Zahida Bibi .Vs. the State” reported in PLD

2006 SC 255, has held that the dying declaration like the

statement of an interested witness requires close scrutiny
and is not to be believed merely for the reasons that the

person is not expected to tell a lie.
8. So far as other circumstantial evidence qua recovery
of crime pistol as well as its matching with empties recovered
from the spot as per FSL report is concerned, admittedly the
empties of .30 bore were recovered from spot on 22.5.2016; but
these were not sent to the FSL on the same day in order to
ascertain as to whether these were fired from one and same
weapon or more. Likewise, appellant was arrested on 29.5.2016
alongwith pistol and: FIR No.1231 dated 29.05.2016 under
section 15 AA, was registered against him at Police Station Faqir
Abad, Peshawar; however it was taken in the case in hand by
Investigation Officer (PW.9) on 7.6.2016 with a delay of (08)
eight days. Moreover, the same was sent to the FSL for its
comparison alongwith recovered empties, which were received
in FSL on 10.06.2016, after three days of its so receipt by the
Investigation Officer; therefore, the positive report of FSL qua
pistol is of no help and support to the prosecution. The record is
silent qua safe custody of the recovered empties of .30 bore, from
22.5.2016 till arrest of accused on 29.5.2016 and; subsequently
crime pistol and recovered empties till 10.6.2016. The
prosecution has not examined any concerned official/officer in
whose safe custody these were lying during this period; which

creates doubt qua recovery of crime pistol and empties of .30
10

bore. “Mushtaq Ahmad & 3 others Vs The State” (PLD 2008 SC
1) and “Ali Sher & others Vs The State” (2008 SCMR 707).

9. It has been advocated by the opposite side,
that appellant has been convicted under Section 15 AA and
sentenced to 8 months RI by Miss Saifa Irfan JMIC,
Peshawar; however, in support of its case, neither any
judicial order/record of the concerned Court was
produced before the learned trial Court nor the
representative of jail authorities examined by learned trial
Court as CW.3 was in a position to explain that on what
ground appellant was convicted and sentenced.

10. Moreover, there is no eye witness of the
occurrence and; being a dark night occurrence,
identification of actual culprits in absence of any source of
light, is not possible. Besides, appellant has not confessed
his guilt before the competent Court of law despite
remaining in police custody for sufficient time; therefore,
his mere nomination on the basis of a manipulated dying
declaration without corroboration by other strong and
cogent evidence, is not sufficient to establish guilt of

accused for the offence carrying capital punishment.
11

11. The motive advanced in the instant case for
commission of offence has not been satisfactorily proved
by the prosecution; as there is nothing on record which
could show that appellant has ever made any demand of
extortion from deceased; nor any report in this regard has
been made by deceased or PW.7-A in any Police Station
against appellant; which could support the motive
advanced by the prosecution.

12. It is primary and legal duty of prosecution to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the standard
of evidence shall be at par with the punishment provided
for a capital offence. It is a well settled principle of law that
one who makes an assertion has to prove it. Thus, the onus
rests upon the prosecution to prove guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt throughout the _ trial.
Presumption of innocence remains throughout the case
until such time the prosecution on the evidence satisfies
the Court beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is
guilty of the offence alleged against him. There cannot be a
fair trial, which is itself the primary purpose of criminal
jurisprudence, if the judges have not been able to clearly

elucidate the rudimentary concept of standard of proof
12

that prosecution must meet in order to obtain a
conviction. Two concepts i.e., "proof beyond reasonable
doubt" and "presumption of innocence" are so closely
linked together that the same must be presented as one
unit. If the presumption of innocence is a golden thread to
criminal jurisprudence, then proof beyond reasonable
doubt is silver, and these two threads are forever
intertwined in the fabric of criminal justice system. As
such, the expression "proof beyond reasonable doubt" is of
fundamental importance to the criminal justice: it is one of
the principles which seeks to ensure that no innocent
person is convicted. Where there is any doubt in the
prosecution story, benefit should be given to the accused,
which is quite consistent with the safe administration of
criminal justice. Further, suspicion howsoever grave or
strong can never be a proper substitute for the standard of
proof required in a criminal case, i.e. beyond reasonable
doubt. The lacuna occasioned in evidence of prosecution,
creates serious doubt not only qua mode and manner of
the occurrence; but also a big question mark on the
alleged dying declaration of deceased then injured.

Needless to mention that while giving the benefit of doubt
13

to an accused it is not necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubt. If there is a circumstance
which creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about
the guilt of the accused; then the accused would be
entitled to the benefit of such doubt, not as a matter of
grace and concession; but as a matter of right. It is based
on the maxim, "it is better that ten guilty persons be
acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted”.

13. For what has been discussed above, we are
unanimous in our view that the prosecution has not
proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the
appellant and the learned trial Court has not properly
appreciated the evidence and other material produced
before it while awarding conviction and sentence to the
appellant vide impugned judgment, which is not
sustainable in the eye of law. As such, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned conviction & sentence recorded by
learned trial Court/ Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
Peshawar vide judgment dated 20.07.2019 is set aside and
the appellant/convict is acquitted of the charges levelled
against him. He is in custody, be released forthwith if not

wanted in any other case.

14. The Murder Reference No.38-P/2019 is
answered in negative.

The above are reasons of our short order of

even date.
