a period of 30 days to avoid any untoward incident and to

ensure peaceful atmosphere in respect of the following

30

matters:

i. Distribution of Sale and purchase of fire cracker;
ii. Aerial firework;
iii. Sale/purchase and transportation of chemicals;

Mosques and other religious places;

firearms;

ix. Use of loudspeakers except azans;

(posters/ pamphlets);

xi. Installation of warning lights on private vehicles
which are using by police L.E.As. These lights are

allowed to Police/ L.E.As vehicles; and _
xii. Entry of Afghan Refugees to Bazar.

It is averred in petition that on 07.10.2022, the
petitioners alongwith others have assembled near Medical
College Timergara situated at Rani District Lower in order to
get record their peaceful protest for violating their rights by
the administration which exacerbated their grievance,
however, this protest was within the limits of law and within
half an hour, the people gathered dispersed. Their assemblage
resulted into.issuance of a murasila, which vas sent by Jawad
FC No.69 to S.H.O of Police Station Khai, District Dir Lower
with allegations that they have violated the order passed
under section 144 CPC, as such, the petitioners were charged
u/s 188 P.P.C in FIR No.173 ibid, hence, this petition.

03. Mr. Asghar Ali Advocate representing the petitioners,

contended that the FIR was lodged for an alleged non-

cognizable offence, which could only be dealt with through
complaint in term of section 4 (f) Cr.P.C read with Schedule
II column 3, therefore, the lodging of FIR is illegal, against
the law, unjustified, not sustainable, uncalled for and without
any lawful authority in consonance with section 195 (a)
CrPC. In support of his submissions, he placed reliance on
the case of “Shahid Khan Vs. State through Station House
Officer and 02 others” (PLJ 2017 Peshawar 354).

04. Contrarily, Mr. Alam Khan Adenzai, learned Assistant
Advocate General while making a reference to notification
No. Judl. -1-3(1)/69 dated 14.03.1969 published in P.L.D
1969 West Pakistan Statutes 52 submitted that offence
committed. u/s 188 PPC is cognizable, for which the
petitioners were rightly charged through lodging of FIR as
such, he prayed for dismissal of the instant petition.

05. Arguments heard and record perused.

06. Séction 154 Cr.P.C provides the mode of information in
the offences as defined ws 4 (f) of Cr.P.C and its treatment,

which reads as under:

“Every such information pertaining to cognizable offence if
given orally to the officer in-charge of the police station shall
be reduced into writing by him or under his dictation and be
read over to the informant and every such information
whether given in writing or reduced into writing as aforesaid
shall be signed by the person giving it and the substance
thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in
such form as the Provincial Government may prescribe in this

behalf”.

The ibid provision of law casts a duty of officer in-
charge of the police station to enter the information regarding
commission of a cognizable offence for which he has no
discretion to refuse registration of FIR. Taking cognizance of
an offence by a Court of law (on a complaint) or lodging of
FIR are two distinct legal remedies under criminal law,
likewise, law does‘not prohibit the lodging of FIR in respect
of a cognizable offence. But when it comes to a non-
cognizable offence as provided under section 155 of Cr.P.C it
puts a clog on the power of Police for direct registration of
case. The term “cognizable offence” has been defined in
section 4 (f) of Cr.P.C, that the offence in which a police
officer, may, in accordance with the second schedule or under
any law for the time being in force, arrest without warrant.
We have gone through from Schedule-II of CrP.C, where
section 188 PPC in column No.3 provides “shall _not arrest
without warrant’ as such, the offence u/s 188 PPC is a non-
cognizable offence. When an offence is non-cognizable then
no FIR could be lodged in terms of section 195 (a) Cr.P.C,
which, for convenience, is reproduced as under:

“(1) No Court shall take cognizance: -

(a) Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of
public servants; of any offence punishable under
sections 172 to 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, except on
the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned
or of some other public servant to whom he is

subordinate.”

The above reproduced provision of law manifests that
the Court shall not take cognizance of the prosecution for
contempt of lawful authority of public servants of any
offence punishable ‘under sections 172 to 188 PPC, except on
the complaint in writing of public servant concerned or of
some other-public servant to whom he is subordinate. In the
instant matter, irrespective of this fact that respondent No.3
has passed an order by imposing ban in respect of the
activities mentioned therein and procession by petitioners
alongwith others ‘on a particular date, after issuance of
notification u/s 144 Cr.P.C, could not provide any
justification to respondent No.3 ( Duty Commissioner), SHO
or any other public servant especially of Police Station Khal,
District Dir Lower to get register an FIR and that too u/s 188
P.P.C, which in Schedule-Il of Cr.P.C has been categorized
as a non-cognizable offence. In non-cognizable offences no
FIR could be lodged except as ordained in section 155 of
Cr.PC. Reliance is placed on the cases of “Bux Ali And 2
Others versus The State and Another” (1980 PCr.LJ 626).
“Sabz Ali Khan and 2 others Versus Inspector General of
Police, KPK and 3 others” (2016 YLR_1279), “Shahid
Khan and 3 others. Versus the State through Station House
Officer (SHO) and 2 others” (2017 YLR 2419), “Muneer
Ahmed Abbasi and 5 others Versus Sessions Judge/Justice

of Peace Bagh, District Bagh and 5 others” (2018 MLD
196), and “Aslam Pervaiz and another Versus Tameer Ali

and 7 others” (2019 YLR 228).

07. Turning to the objection of the learned A.A.G, for
which, he has referred to a notification u/s 10 (1) of Criminal
Law Amendment- Act, 1932 (Act No. XXII of 1932),
whereby the offence punishable under section 188 PPC in
West Pakistan was regarded as a cognizable offence,
regarding which, a note has been provided as pointed out by
the learned A.A.G. When section 195 (a) Cr.P.C has provided
a mechanism for taking the cognizance of a non-cognizable
offence and likewise, section 54 Cr.P.C in cognizable
offences and when no such amendment has been made either
in section 195 of 154 Cr.P,C then on the strength of
notification (supra), without any amendment in section 195
Cr.P.C and by the amendment only in column No.3 of
Schedule-II of CePC, the offence u/s 188 PPC, by no stretch
of imagination, shall be termed as a cognizable offence and
when the offence is non-cognizable, no FIR could be lodged.
Cognizance of such offence could only be taken when a
complaint is made in writing by a public servant concerned or
any of his subordinate, as such, mandatory provision of law
was grossly violated by the police by registering the FIR
against the petitioner in a non-cognizable offence without

following the prescribed procedure provided in Cr.P.C,

Sabz Ali/* (@.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IOBAL,

-7J-
lodging of FIR is" unjustified, void ab-initio, uncalled for,
unwarranted, violative to section 195 Cr.P.C and that too by
responsible officer. ie., respondent No.2 on the basis of an
order passed by respondent No.3 u/s 144 CrP.C. Both the
responsible officers, being public functionaries, were
required to act in-“accordance, with proper and reasonable
justification. In similar situation, in the case of “Akhtar Said
Vs. Rozi Mul and others” (W.P No.515-M/2021) decided on
18.01.2022, this Court has directed to quash FIR registered
u/s 188 PPC. Likewise, in W.P No.2208-P/2022 titled

“Peshawar High Court Bar Vs. The State etc.” decided on
15.09.2022, this Court has also held that “lodging of FIR in

non-cognizable offence is utter violation of the provisions of

sf

Cr.P.C_and now_it has been well settled that FIR can_be

quashed if from the bare reading of its contents, a cognizable
offence is not made.out”.
08. In the case of “Muhammad Aslam (Amir Aslam) and

others Vs. District Police Officer, Rawalpindi_and others”
(2009 SCMR 141) it was held by the apex Court that there is

no invariable rule of law and it dependents on the facts of
each case whether.to allow the proceedings to continue or to
nip in the bud especially when no offence has been made out
and when the allegations from the face of it appears to be
groundless and in such circumstances continuation of the

proceedings would be a futile exercise and wastage of time.

Cr.P.C. Thus, for the reasons discussed above, instant petition

succeeds, same stands allowed and resultantly FIR No.173

ibid is hereby quashed.

Announced.
