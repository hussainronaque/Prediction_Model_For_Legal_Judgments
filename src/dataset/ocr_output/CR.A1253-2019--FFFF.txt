ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J:- This criminal appeal filed

by Shakeel Ahmad, convict/appellant, is directed
against the judgment/order dated 17.09.2019 of
learned Judge Special Court (CNS) Peshawar,
whereby, the appellant was convicted under section 9
(c) 14/15 CNSA, 1997, and sentenced him to life
imprisonment with fine of Rs.1,000,000/- (One
Million) and in default of payment of fine, he shall
further undergo for a period of one year S.I; with
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C; in case registered
against the accused/appellant vide F.I.R No.57 dated

23.05.2016 under Section 9 (c) 14/15 CNSA, Police
Station ANF Peshawar. It was ordered by the learned
trial Court that in case of default of payment of fine
the sentences shall run consecutive to the main
sentence.

2. It is the case of prosecution that ANF high-
ups received information about trafficking of huge
quantity of narcotics by drug peddler Muhammad
Zeb son of Jehanzeb and Liaqat Afridi through their
Agent Shakeel Ahmed through motorcar Honda Civil
bearing registration No.HB-778/Islamabad from
Peshawar to the Province of Punjab. Upon the
information, complainant/IO alongwith his team laid
a barricade on the spot, meanwhile, the said motorcar
arrived from Peshawar which was stopped for the
purpose of checking. The driver of the motorcar was
de-boarded who disclosed his name as Shakeel
Ahmad and upon query, he accepted the
presence/concealment of narcotics in secrete cavity
made in the floor of the diggi of the motorcar. Upon
the pointation of accused/driver Shakeel Ahmad, the
secrete cavity was opened on the spot and 44 packets,
containing 29 packets of chars and 15 packets of
opium (in the shape of tikkies/pieces) were recovered

by the complainant/IO in the presence of witnesses.
“y

The complainant/IO weighed the contraband and
each packet came out to be 1200/1200 grams each
and thus total 34.800 kilograms chars and 18
kilograms opium. The complainant/IO separated
10/10 grams chars from each packet and also
separated small quantity from each tikki of opium
making 10/10 grams opium from each packet for the
purpose of FSL. The separated samples as well as the
remaining narcotics were sealed into separate parcels
with SRK monogram on each. After his arrest,
accused Shakeel Ahmed disclosed that the vehicle
containing the contraband was handed over to him by
one Amjad Khan, who is the partner of Muhammad
Zeb and Liagat Afridi, owner of the narcotics. The
complainant/IO (PW-2) prepared the recovery memo
Ex.PW2/1, drafted the murasila Ex.PW2/2 and sent
the same to the PS for registration of the case through
HC Shafi Ullah/driver. The complainant/PW-2 has
also conducted investigation in the case. Hence the
case was registered against the accused.

3. During trial, the prosecution examined as
many as five (05) witnesses in the case. Statements of
the accused were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,

wherein, they neither wished to be examined on oath
nor desired to produce evidence in their defense.
After hearing learned counsels for the accused and
learned Special Prosecutor for the State, the learned
Judge Special Court (CNS) Peshawar, rendered the
impugned judgment dated 17.09.2019, thereby,

convicting the accused/appellant as mentioned above.

4. Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused.
5. The complainant/Investigation Officer Saif-

ur-Rehman appeared before the learned trial Court
and examined as PW-2. In the start of his cross
examination he has stated that “Now-a-days I am not
in service because I have been dismissed from
service. It is correct that I was dismissed from
service by my department because I had asked
illegal gratification from the accused of some other
case. Volunteered that I was trapping in the SOS of
the case of 34/16 of PS ANF Peshawar but sadly I
was involved in a false case. It is correct that a
month or two ago I was arrested by the FIA for
receiving illegal gratification. Volunteered that I
was dismissed already by the ANF from service.”
From the above deposition of this PW it is

abundantly clear that he has been dismissed from
service once on the allegations of asking for illegal
gratification then again a month or two prior to his
examination before the Court he was again arrested
in another case by the F.I.A for receiving illegal
gratification. If this is the state of credibility of the
prime witness of prosecution on which they expects
this Court to impose capital punishment or for that
matter life imprisonment, indeed the Court will strive
for some strong independent corroboration. In cases
of narcotics conviction is based on the testimony of
police officials and police officials are considered to
be as good witnesses as any other witness. The
reason is that they being member of the respectable
law enforcing agencies the Court rely on their
testimony and award capital punishment to the
accused most particularly in cases wherein they have
recovered considerable quantity of narcotic which of
course is a manic for the society but on the other
hand Courts being custodian of the constitutional
rights and under obligation to administer justice
according to law and the well settled norms of the
criminal justice, when a witness having such a
dubious record how the prosecution could expect the

Court to consider his testimony and award sentence
to the accused. The narcotic laws has given ample
powers to the police officials and even safeguard
under section 103 Cr.P.C has been taken away by
section 25 Control of Narcotic Substances, Act 1997,
which reads as under;

“25. Mode of making searches and arrest.
The provision of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898; except those of Section 103,
shall mutatis mutandis, apply to all searches
and arrests in so far as they are not inconsistent
with the provisions of sections 20, 21, 22 and 23
to all warrants issued and arrests and searches
made under these sections.”
6. Prosecution in such circumstances and most
particularly ANF is expected to conduct fair and
impartial investigation through efficient and honest
officials. When, if any doubt arises with regard to the
credibility of the PWs then the Court is left with no
other choice but to discard that evidence produce by
the prosecution. Even then we would look for some
strong independent corroboration but the same is not
available. Admittedly the recovery has been effected
near M-1 Toll Plaza Peshawar but the CCTV footage
has not been taken into possession. Even photographs

at the time of arrest have not been placed on the file

which could have corroborated the testimony of
A.NF officials most particularly the statement of
complainant/ Investigation Officer (PW-2). By
considering the facts and circumstances of the present
case it was incumbent upon the prosecution to have
brought some corroborative piece of evidence in
addition to the evidence referred above.

7. Coming to the statement of Shafi Ullah/PW-
3, marginal witnesses to the recovery memo. He was
subordinate to complainant/Investigation Officer/
PW-2 and he was supposed to toe the line of
complainant and his statement is alone is not
sufficient for maintaining life imprisonment of the
appellant.

8. Besides the above, complainant/investigation
officer (PW-2) in his cross examination stated that
they made their departure and arrival back in the
Police Station, extract of daily diary is not available
on the record. Complainant/IO/PW-2 in his cross
examination admitted correct that he has not placed
on file the extract of the said daily diary regarding his
departure and arrival back to the PS in the present
case. It is revolving common practice with the
investigation officers that they are lacking, their

interest to collect the material evidence in the cases
and even no heed is paid to collect the daily diaries
from the police stations regarding the arrival and
departure of all concerned with the investigation of a
particular case, as these are the documents which can
correctly explain the status of the witnesses, their
presence at the spot, the time they consume in
reaching to the spot and the names of police officials
who accompany. If these documents are brought on
record, the Investigation Officer will lose the courage
to manipulate the cases in police stations. In the
present case, when the complainant/Investigation
Officer (PW-2) was questioned regarding the arrival
and departure from the police station to spot, he
blatantly answered that he did not place on record the
daily diary in this respect. His lack of seriousness
tells nothing but to stamp him as an interested
witness and his testimony cannot wholeheartedly be
relied upon. Reliance is placed on the case titled
“Pir Noroz Ali Shah v. The State” {2019 PCr.LJ
457 (Peshawar Abbottabad Bench} wherein it is

held that;

“In order to establish the movement of police
official through confidence inspiring
evidence, the production of daily diary of the
police station showing the departure,

constitution of raiding team, its members and
subsequent arrival, was a material piece of

evidence in favour of prosecution. Indeed the

daily diaries are maintained under the

erstwhile Police Rules 1934. Under Rule

28.48 it is mandatory for every police official

to make entry of his departure, arrival and all

proceedings conducted between the

intervening period of departure and arrival.

Non-production of the daily diary has caused

serious doubts in the prosecution case

regarding the mode and manner of raid”
9. Likewise there is no extract of Register-19
and Register-21 on the record. Ishfaq Hussain
Muharrir/PW-5 has stated that on return of the IO to
the PS he handed over to him the case property and
that he made its entry in Register-19. In his cross
examination he admitted correct that he has not
brought register 19 or register 21 in support of his
contention before the Court. Similarly Receipt
Rahdari and acknowledgement receipt are also not
available on the file. The prosecution did not
produce the Register No. 19 of the Police Station so
as to prove that the case property was ever kept in
Malkhana of the police station. In this way, the
prosecution, has wasted the best evidence available

with it to have been established the safe custody of

recovered contraband. It is also on record that one
10

of the PW, namely, Imtiaz Khan constable, who
was the 2nd marginal witness to the recovery memo
was abandoned by the prosecution for reasons best
known to them. So, in the situation, not only
adverse inference under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984 can be safely drawn, but the
legal inference could also be drawn that if the said
witnesses had entered into the witness box then
they would not have supported the prosecution
case. In this regard wisdom can be safely derived

from case law reported in NER 2015 SCJ 121 and

PLD 2016 SC 17.

10. According to the FIR, the recovery was
effected near Motorway Toll Plaza Peshawar and
near the place of occurrence there is permanent check
post of the local police station which is admitted in
his cross examination by complainant/Investigation
Officer (PW-2). Volunteered, that the customs and
Excise departments are also laid down nakabandis
for specific period. They were not private witnesses.
They were the police official of local Police Station
and the alleged recovery was effected near the said
check post. At least to extent of their arrival to the

spot, recovery and arrest of the accused someone of
11

the officials of the police post should have been
examined by the prosecution to authenticate the
recovery proceedings. PW-2 in his cross examination
has admitted correct that he neither informed the
local police nor has associated them with the
recovery proceedings, despite the fact that the local
police were present near the spot. Volunteered, that
he has the jurisdiction and the powers to conduct his
case without involving any other force in his case.
Moreover, the occurrence had taken place at 09:15
hours while complainant/PW-2 in his cross
examination has stated that he handed over . the
murasila to HC Shafi Ullah at 1215 hours whereas
the time of report is also 1215 hours. In view of
above, it seems that the occurrence had not taken
place in the mode and manner as alleged by the
prosecution.

11. The crux of the above discussion is that the
prosecution case is pregnant with shortcomings,
doubts and dents. It is an axiomatic principle of law
that in case of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue
in favour of the accused as matter of right and not of

grace.
12

12. For what has been discussed above, we hold
that the impugned judgment dated 17.09.2019
rendered by the learned Judge Special Court (CNS)
Peshawar, is suffering from misreading and non-
reading of the evidence available on the record, hence
not sustainable. As such, this appeal is allowed and
the appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled
against him. He be set free forthwith, if not required
in any other case.

13. The above are the reasons of our short order
of even date.

Announced.
