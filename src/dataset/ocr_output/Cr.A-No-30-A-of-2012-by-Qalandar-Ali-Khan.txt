application of the complainant. However, spot was
inspected by the 1.0. during which, blood stained
earth was secured from the places assigned to all the
three deceased in the site plan, while four crime
empties of 7.62 bore were shown to have been
recovered from the places assigned to the
accused/appellants in the site plan. The blood stained
earth secured from the spot and blood stained
garments of the deceased were dispatched to the
Forensic Science Laboratory and report therefrom
was received in the affirmative. The report of Fire
Arms Expert in respect of the crime empties
recovered from the spot and the 7.62 bore rifle,
alleged weapon of offence, was also received in the
affirmative with respect to the two crime empties and
in the negative with respect to the remaining two
crime empties. After arrest of the accused, recording
statements of witnesses under section 161 Cr.P.C. and

accused/appellants under sections 302/148/149 PPC,
to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
During trial, as many as eight P.Ws were examined by
the prosecution, namely, Munawar, complainant,
(P.W.1); Nizamuddin, eyewitnesses mentioned in the
FIR alongwith another eyewitness and his brother
and cousin of the complainant, Muhammad Ali
(P.W.2); Muhammad Abbas Khan SHO submitted
challan (P.W.3); constable Syed Naseer, witness to the
dispatch of various articles recovered in the case to
the FSL and Fire Arms Expert (P.W.4); Muhammad
Tahir ASI drafted Murasila on the report of the
complainant (P.W.5}; Khurshid Ahmad MHC

here that one of the accused/appellant, namely, Abdul
Latif also lodged FIR No.10 dated 03.04.2011 under
section 337-F(ii)/34 PPC police station, Karang,
Kohistan, in respect of the same occurrence by giving
his own version and therein charging both the
eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR, namely,
Muhammad Ali and Nizamuddin for causing him
injuries with axe blows. Anyhow, the trial culminated
in che impugned judgment.

6. The judgment of the learned trial court leading
to conviction and sentence of the accused/appellants
is primarily based on the motive for the offence,
ocular account of the eyewitnesses mentioned in the
FIR, recovery of crime empties from the spot and
weapon of offence, together with presence of
accused/appellant Abdul Latif and eyewitnesses on
the spot at the time of occurrence in view of report by
the accused /appellant.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for the convict-
appellants, learned Additional A.G. and Jearned counse!
for the complainant heard, and record perused.

&. The FIR was, admittedly, lodged after delay of 14
hours at 04:00 hours on the following day of the

occurrence ic. 30.03.2011, while the occurrence had
taken place at 1400 hours on 29.03.2011. The
distance between place of occurrence and _ police
station has been shown as 8/10 kilometers; but the
report was not lodged by the complainant in the
police station; and he reported the occurrence to the
police on their arrival at his residence, where he was
present alongwith the dead bodies of his brothers
Anwar Khan and Fazal-e-Qadir; and even injured
Shamsul Qamar was present there and not taken to
he hospital for treatment. It is, indeed, noteworthy
that the complainant was himself a fugitive from law
and declared proclaimed offender in case FIR
No.17/10 under sections 506/448/449/34 PPC of
police station Karang. The inordinate delay in lodging
the FIR in the house of the complainant instead of the
police station or hospital, presence of seriously
injured, Shamsul Qamar, who later on succumbed to
his injuries, in the house even after 14 hours of the
occurrence and his non-shifting to the hospital for

Copy treatment, together with the fact that the compiainant
ro be True

Certified , , ,
bo was himself proclaimed offender and fugitive from
= 4 Court

Peshay  nch . Lae c
Appotisne ees eras law, would cast serious doubts about credibility of the
patronized

report and authenticity of the FIR.

9. Neither the complainant nor the two
eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR received a single

injury or even a scratch in the occurrence despite
alleged indiscriminate firing, claiming three lives who

have been shown in the close proximity of the
deceased in the site plan, which would make it next to
impossible for the persons in the line of firing to
escape unhurt. These facts would also give rise to
serious doubts about the presence of the compiainant

_—' and eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR,
otwithstanding the fact that all the three deceased
namely, Anwar Khan, Fazal Qadir and Shamsul Qamar
are real brothers of the complainant while beth the
said eyewitnesses are his cousins, and apart from the
fact that Nizamuddin furnished no explanation for his
presence and presence of his real brother and other
eyewitness, Muhammad Ali, on the spot at the time of
occurrence, except that they had gone to the
residence of the complainant on the eventful day. It

cop ray also be added here that both the eyewitnesses

10. One of the accused/appellant, Abdul Latif, also
sustained axe blow injuries and lodged his report vide
FIR No.10 dated 03.04.2011 under section 337-
F(ii)/34 PPC police station Karang against both the
eyewitnesses, Nizamuddin and Muhammad Ali, while
giving a different version about the occurrence. If
viewed in the context of cross case/version with
regard to the same occurrence, one would find the
scene of occurrence situated close to the house of the
accused as compared to the residence of the
complainant and deceased and genuinely suspect
them for aggression.

11. The police could, allegedly, recover only one
weapon of offence from the residential room of
accused/appellant, Abdul Latif; but it is intriguing to
note that the accused/appellant was arrested form
the same room on 31.03.2011, while the weapon of
offence was shown to have been recovered on his
pointation on 3.4.2011. In any case, the crime empties
recovered during spot inspection on 30.03.2011 and
the so called weapon of offence recovered on 3.4.3011
were received in the Forensic Science Laboratory for
their examination by the Fire Arms Expert with

considerable delay on 8.4.2011, with no cogent
10

evidence with respect to their safe custody during the
intervening period, thus eroding the evidentiary value
of the report of Fire Arms Expert. Above all,
accused/appellant, Abdul Latif, has been acquitted of
the charge under section 13 AO, vide judgment/order
of even date.
12. Likewise, the recovery of the other weapons of
offence i.e. axes, which were handed over to the LO.
by the two accused/appellants, Hakim Zai and
Nizamuddin, would be of no significance as the axes
were not having blood stains and their handles were
found freshly cut. Besides one of the axes was shown
to have been recovered from accused /appellant
flakim Zai instead of Ameer Zai, which has been
declared a clerical mistake by the learned trial court.
It is noteworthy that axe blows to deceased Shamsul
Qamar had been attributed to accused /appcllants
Nizamuddin and Ameer Zai, but the 1.0. not only
TONE In Be THe Cony showed recovery from the accused/appellant Hakim

13. Moreover, the accused/appellants have been

shown arrested in the Card Of Arrest at 1245 hours

on 31.03.2011 but in his statement in the court the
1.0, mentioned the date of arrest as 30.03.2011, which
fact was also supported by Muhammad Tahir ASI
(P.W.5). On account of these  contradictions/
discrepancies, the learned trial court was constrained
to pass remarks against the I.0., and approach DIG
Hazara Division and DPO Kohistan for action against
him. Even then benefit of such discrepancies/doubts
was not extended to the accused/appellants.

14. Apart from the above  discrepancies/
infirmities in the case of the prosecution, the learned
trial court acquitted co-accused, Fazal Wadood, on the
ground that he was suffering from some kind of
mental ailment and was charged for consultation
alongwith co-accused Alamzeb by the mother of
complainant in the court on 22.02.2012, though Fazal
Wadood was specifically charged for the ‘Qatl-i-Amd’
of Fazal Qadir alongwith convict appellant Abdul Latif.
Likewise, the co-accused, Alamzeb, who was
specifically charged and assigned the same role of
causing axe blows, as attributed to the co-accused

Ameer Zai and Nizamuddin, was acquitted on the

a

Pesnawa’ han Court . . ;
Abgotiabea Bench basis of concessional statement of the mother of the

sau@rorizey Unies ec 07) Acts Ordms’
complainant in the court on 22.02.2012, coupled with
the fact that he was aged about 70/71 years and no
recovery was made from his possession.

15. The learned trial court took extra pain to
explain that absence of postmortem report would
have no adverse effect on the prosecution case, but
lost sight of the fact that in view of substantial delay
in lodging the FIR and fatal discrepancies in the ocular
and circumstantial evidence of the prosecution, the
absence of postmortem report could not be so easily
overlooked.

16. In view of the foregoing discussion, the instant
appeal is accepted and on setting aside the impugned
judgment of the learned Zilla Qazi/Sessions Judge,
Kohistan dated 24.02.2012, the impugned conviction
and sentences of the appellants under section 302-B
Cr.P.C. are set aside and they be set free forthwith if
not required in any other case.

17. Resultantly, Cr.A.No.39-A/2012 by the
complainant against acquittal of accused/respondents
Alamzeb and Fazal Wadood, is dismissed as abated
against the deceased accused/respondent_, Alamzeb;
and also dismissed on merits against
accused/respondent Fazal Wadood in the light of this

judgment.
18. Likewise, as a natural corollary, the
Cr.R.No.11-A/2012 of the complainant for
enhancement of sentence of the appellants stands

dismissed.
