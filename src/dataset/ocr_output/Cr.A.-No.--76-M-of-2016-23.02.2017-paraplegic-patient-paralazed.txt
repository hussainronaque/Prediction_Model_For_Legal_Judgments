4. After closure of the prosecution evidence,

accused/Appellant was examined under section 342,

Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the charges, posed

innocence and stated to have falsely been implicated in

the case. He, however wished to produce no defence,

nor to examine himself on oath as required under

section 340(2), Cr.P.C

5. Evidence of the prosecution entailed

judicial prudent mind of the Presiding Officer of the

Court of learned Sessions Judge/ Zila Qazi Malakand

at Batkhela, therefore sentences thought for were

awarded through the impugned order, hence the

present appeal.

6. Here, fair opportunity of hearing was

afforded to the learned counsel for accused/Appellant,

learned counsel for the complainant and learned State
“Nawab”

-7-

counsel, record with their valuable assistance gone

through.

7. Learned counsel for the accused/Appellant

relied on NLR 2014 Criminal 495 “ Jehad Ali vs Riaz

Ali_and_ another”, 2010 SCMR_ 374 “ Muhammad

Saleem vs the State”, 2008 SCMR 6 “ Akhtar Ali and

others _vs_the State”, NLR _ 2014 Criminal 516 “

Muhammad Sharif vs the State”, 2007 SCMR 1825 “

Farman Ahmed vs Muhammad Inayat and others” ,

2007 SCMR 670 “ Muhammad Pervez and others vs

the State_and_ others”, 2011 SCMR_ 527 “ Nazir

Ahmad_vs_Muhammad_ Iqbal”, 2012 MLD _ 964

(@eshawar) “ Abdul Majeed and 2 others vs the State

and_another”, 2006 P Cr. L_J_ 1827 (Lahore) “

Muhammad Arif vs the State” and 2007 MLD 613

(Peshawar) “ Sajjad _Ali_vs_ Mst. Mah _Pari_and

another”. In the light of these dictums of the Hon’ble

superior Courts, prayed for acceptance of the appeal

and acquittal of the convict-appellant as _ the

prosecution failed to prove their version in respect of
“Nawab”

-8-

ocular account as the alleged eyewitnesses of the

occurrence were abandoned coupled with the fact that

the identification of the accused/Appellant at the time

of occurrence is also shrouded in mystery. Inversely

the learned counsel for the complainant referred to

2016 MLD 1997 (Sindh) “ Irfan alias Irfoo and 2

others vs the State”, 2016 P Cr. L J 722 (Lahore) “

Abdul_Sattar_vs_the State”, 2005 P Cr. L_ J 667

Lahore) “ Muhammad Hanif vs the State” and_2012

PCr. L J 1662 (Peshawar) “ Khan Ahmad Khan and

another _vs the State and 2 others”. Learned State

counsel also placed reliance on PED 2015 Sindh 426 “

Qadan_ alias Qadir Bux and another vs the State”,

2016 P Cr. L J 1408 (Peshawar Mingora Bench Dar-

ul-Qaza) “ Mst. Bukhti-Haram ys Sabir and 4 others”

+ PLD 1995 Supreme Court 46 “ Mushtaq alias

Shaman __vs_the State” and 2012 YLR__1355

(Baluchistan) “ Shah Jehan and another vs the State

They both vehemently opposed the arguments

advanced by learned counsel for the accused/Appellant
“Nawab”

-9.

and prayed for dismissal of the appeal being shorn of

merits as the medical evidence, self-stated testimony of

the injured/complainant and recoveries effected from

the spot in shape of blood stained earth, empty shells of

30 bore pistol and above all the Torch fully

corroborates the version of prosecution.

8. In the case in hand PW-8 Nek Muhammad

alias Neko is the complainant who was on his way to

attend the call of nature at "Fajr" time. At the relevant

a sole accused Sabir Shah who was armed with his

pistol asked him where he is proceeding, he was

replied that he is on way to attend the call of nature

then the accused/Appellant Sabir Shah resorted to

firing due to which the complainant was hit on various

parts of his body. But the most deadly fire shot of the

accused/Appellant proved effective which has hit him

on his lumber region who has since been paralysed.

9. While developing his arguments, learned

counsel for the accused/Appellant mainly prayed for

the acquittal of his client (Appellant) on the ground
“Nawab”

-10-

that the identification is at stake as it was "Fajr" time

when the occurrence took place so due to low visibility

identification of the accused/Appellant was almost

impossible. The accused/Appellant was not properly

identified hence it is an alone ground for his acquittal.

10. This proposition was replied to the effect

that since the time of occurrence is not disputed as in

the month of August otherwise at 4.10 A.M in the

morning there is almost light as rays of the sun are next

to come out. Besides the distance between the assailant

and the victim is so short or in other words so nearer

i.e. 7 paces that even in dark night if the parties are

known to each other it would hardly be a matter of

creating any doubt regarding identification. It has come

in the statement of PW-8 Nek Muhammad alias Neko

that while he was on his way to attend the call of

nature he was holding a torch in his hand, thereby

mistaken identification would hardly be ground for

acquittal of the accused/Appellant. Even if

identification for sake of arguments is taken as ground,
“Nawab”

-ll-

even then the torch light is sufficient source of light at

the time of witnessing the incident. In this case the

torch has been taken up vide recovery memo Ex. PW-

5/3 and to this extent statement of PW-5 has been duly

recorded thus leaving no room for misidentification of

the accused/Appellant.

11. In this case as many as nine (9) witnesses

have been examined and all statements of the

prosecution witnesses are linked in chain. The Medical

Officer Dr. Amjad Ali who has been examined as

PW-1 has affirmed the injuries sustained by the

complainant Nek Muhammad alias Neko. The

complainant has narrated the version of

happening/occurrence in the mode and manner when

hardly cross-examined had adverted to disbelieve him.

The fire shots of the accused/Appellant have been

proved so effective that it has resulted into complete

L1/L2 Paraplegia as affirmed by the Discharge

Certificate from Paraplegic Centre Hayat Abad.
“Nawab”

-12-

12. The report of the injured/complainant in

shape ‘Murasila’ would reveal that Salih Muhammad

and Shah Riaz who were present at the time of

occurrence have been named therein to have witnessed

the occurrence but these witnesses were abandoned as

they did not opt to record their statements as they have

been pressurized, so mere on this score too the

complainant being sole witness, his self-stated

testimony cannot be brushed aside. The complainant

has been held to be a truthful witness and whatever he

has stated is confidence inspiring and it rings true.

Then his version is further supported by the medical

evidence which is sufficient to bring home the charges

against the accused/Appellant. In all criminal cases

when conviction is based on singular testimony of a

witness it is always quality and not quantity of the

evidence which is to be seen by the Court. Intrinsic

value of the statement of the injured/complainant who

has sustained injuries which has altogether brought him

the endless misery by way of disability for the rest of
“Nawab”

-13-

his life, the Court ought to have satisfied and it should

be believed according to the Article 17 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order 1984. In the Hudood cases and

financial matters there is requirement of the

competency and number of witnesses but in all other

criminal cases even the single injured/complainant

could testify the occurrence, which in this case has

been explained reasonably and alone the

accused/Appellant has been charged.

13. Therefore, in view of what has been

discussed above I am of the firm view that there is no

persistence in this appeal in respect of extending of

benefit of doubt to the accused/Appellant; hence it is

hereby answered in negative. The findings of the

learned Court of Sessions Judge/ Zila Qazi Malakand

at Batkhela are absolutely decorously delivered for

the sentences as awarded.
