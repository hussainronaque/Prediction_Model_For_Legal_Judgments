QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:-This appeal by

Mst. Saira Khan widow of late Rizwan under
Section 48 CNSA is directed against the
judgment/order of learned Judge, Special
Court (CNS), Peshawar, dated 31.03.2016,
whereby, application of the petitioner for
return of the vehicle (Honda Civic) No.VV-

155/Islamabad, was dismissed.

2. The aforementioned motorcar was

taken into possession in case vide FIR No.05
dated 11.01.2014 under Sections 9 ( c )/14/15
CNSA P.S ANF, Peshawar, after recovery of
seven packets of opium, each packet
weighing one kilogram total 7 kilograms, and 4
packets of chars, each packet weighing one
kilogram, total 4 kgs chars Garda, from a
secret cavity in the dish-board of the motorcar.
At the time of recovery of the narcotics, Imran
Dilawar son of Dilawar Masih was found on
the driving seat of the motorcar, and along
with cash amount and other articles, a receipt
of Madina Rent-A car, showing the said
accused/appellant in the connected
Cr.ANo.607-P/2014 having hired the car for
self driving, was also recovered from his
possession. After facing trial before the
learned Judge, Special Court (CNS),
Peshawar, the said accused/appellant was
convicted under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and
awarded the sentence of life imprisonment
with fine of Rs.200000/-. The
accused/appellant preferred appeal, which

has been partially accepted, and
imprisonment for life reduced to five years R.|
and fine of Rs.200000/- also reduced to
Rs.50,000/- and in default of payment of fine
to further two months S.I.

3. The learned Judge, Special Court
(CNS), Peshawar, dismissed application of
the petitioner/appellant, mainly, on the ground
that partnership of late Rizwan, predecessor
of the  petitioner/appellant, with the
accused/appellant in the connected criminal
appeal could not be ruled out; and, at the
same time, passed order of confiscation of the
vehicle, which was not made earlier on
account of pendency of petition of late Rizwan
for return of the vehicle on superdari.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG heard, and record
perused.

5. The perusal of record would show that
there is no rival claimant; and further at the
time of arrest of Imran Dilawar, appellant in
the connected appeal, after recovery of the

contraband from the motorcar, a receipt of
Madina Rent-A Car, owned by Rizwan, late
husband of the appellant, was also recovered
from the accused/appellant in the connected
appeal, showing hiring of the car by him for
self driving. As such, with proof of driving of
the car by accused/appellant, Imran Dilawar,
at the relevant time, this fact was also clearly
proved that the car belonged to Madina Rent-
A Car, owned by the late husband of the
appellant. Moreover, it has also been proved
on the record that Rizwan purchased the car
from Azam Khan who had purchased the
same through an open transfer letter from the
registered owner, namely, Noor-ul-Amin. The
said Noor-ul-Amin, a doctor by profession,
also appeared as CW.3 and deposed about
sale of the car by him.

6. Therefore, in view of evidence
adduced in support of purchase of the car by
Rizwan, late husband of the appellant,
absence of rival claimant, and also proof of
the fact that the cavity was not specially

created in the vehicle, together with evidence
proving the motorcar hired by the
accused/appellant in the connected appeal
from Madina Rent-A car, there was no
justification for declining request of the
appellant for return of the vehicle.

7. As such, the appeal is accepted; and
while setting aside the impugned order dated
31.03.2016, the application of the appellant for

return of the vehicle is accepted, accordingly.

Announced.
