ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Through the instant appeal, Amir

Ullah, the appellant has questioned order dated 30.11.2021, passed
by learned Judge Child Protection Court, Peshawar, whereby his
minor son, namely, Obaid Ullah (to be referred hereinafter as the
child), has been placed under the care of the Child Protection
Institute, namely, “Zamung Kor” till his discharge or attaining the
age of 18 years.
2. Facts in brief forming the background of the instant writ
petition are that Syed Omar Ali Shah, SWO of “Zamung Kor” vide
js" dated 30.11.2021, produced the child before the Child
é Protection Court, Peshawar. The child was rescued by the said
Institution on the basis of video gone viral on social media where
the child can be seen wearing no shoes in winter season and selling

masks. The child interviewed by the Child Protection Court,
Peshawar, wherein he disclosed that his father is a daily wages
labour and from the last one year he is selling Masks and is also
engaged in beggary staying outside home till late night.
Appellant/father of the child appeared before the learned Child
Protection Court, Peshawar, and showed his regret and promised
that he will not engage his child in selling Masks and begging,
therefore, his custody may be returned to him. Keeping in view age
of the child i.e. 5/6 years and feeble financial status of his father,
the learned Child Protection Court, Peshawar, turned down the

request of the appellant and passed the following order:-

“In the circumstances, by keeping in view the welfare of

child being at risk, he is placed under the care of Child
Protection Institute “Zamung Kor” till discharge or till

ee)

3. Through the instant appeal, the appellant/father of the
child has questioned the aforesaid order, seeking return of custody
of his child.

4. On 11.02.2022, when the case was taken up for hearing,
Mr. Rafiullah, Social Welfare Officer “Zamung Kor” along with the
worthy Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa appeared and
stated that child, namely, Obaid Uliah aged 5/6 years had been
taken into custody from BRT Station Abdara road Peshawar and
was admitted in KG in a welfare school where he is being provided
quality education. Appellant/father of the child stated that he is a
daily wager and used to leave home early in the morning and return
late at evening. The child always slips away with his friends for
roaming and vagrancy. Keeping in view the weak financial
situation of appellant, his careless attitude towards his child and to
determine welfare of the child, the Director “Zamung Kor” was
directed to submit a detail report with regard to education and social
welfare activities of the children staying in the Organization,
namely, Zamung Kor.

5. On 05.09.2022, Syed Umar Ali Shah (litigation Officer)
“Zamung Kor” stated at the bar that during vacations, the child was
handed over to his parents, but now the parents are avoiding to
return him to “Zamung Kor”. Accordingly, Naseem Khan SHO
Police Station Tehkal was summoned and directed to produce the
child along with his parents on the next date of hearing. On
09.09.2022, the child was produced before the court and handed

over to Litigation Officer, named above for keeping him in
“Zamung Kor” for care and education purposes. On next date of
hearing i.e. 19.10.2022, Mr. Muhammad Inam Khan Yousafzai,
AAG pointed out that Provincial Government has made certain
amendments in the Vagrancy Act wherein efforts for rehabilitation
of beggars are introduced for first time instead of penal action. He
further stated that the worthy Commissioner Peshawar is
instrumental in eradication of vagrancy in Peshawar Division and
he has done a lot of reforms in this regard. Accordingly, the worthy
Commissioner Peshawar was put on notice with direction to file
comprehensive report. Similarly, the Director Chief Child
Protection Commission, Peshawar, was also summoned with
direction to personally appear before the court along with record.
On 15.11.2022, Mr. Muhammad Ijaz Muhammad, Deputy Chief
Child Protection Welfare Commission Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
appeared and stated that they have taken serious steps for
rehabilitation of the child at risk and child begging in the streets,
however, requested for time to submit a detail report in this regard.
The case was, therefore, posted to 06.12.2022.

6. The requisite report has been submitted by the Director
“Zamung Kor”, according to which the Government of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa is envisaging “a child sensitive society where
children can enjoy their rights of protection, survival and
development and participation in a peaceful and congenial
atmosphere without any discrimination”. In order to convert these
ideas into reality, a Model Institute for State Children, namely,

“Zamung Kor” has been established in July, 2016 under the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, amended in
2016 and with the gradual increase of the State children, the
number has now touched the figure of 652, who are being provided
Shelter, clothes and other facilities such as boarding, lodging, free
books, health services and quality education, psycho-social support
and opportunities for co-curricular and extracurricular activities.
The day to day affairs of the Institution are carried out by the
Director and his dedicated team. For psycho social support of the
children with traumatic backgrounds the Institution has also
furnished facility of counseling them. For this purpose two
psychologist are assigned the task of psychosocial support to the
students. After getting admission in the Institution “Zamong Kor”
the children remain under observation of those psychologists for 15
days. Psychologists counsel the children and make their mind ready
to get education. In academic wing the Institution has enrolled 652
students and has placed them in different grades according to their
aptitude. The children are getting formal education according to the
new technologies and up to date teaching methodologies. Similarly,
An MOU is being signed with Technical Education and Vocational
Authority (TEVTA) for skill development of the children and
TEVTA will also help the Institution Zamung Kor in equipping its
Labs. An endowment fund is also generated i.e. Rs.2000/- per
month for each child of the Institution from July 2021 which will be
given to the children after leaving the Institute at the age of 18
years. This amount will be helpful for the children to start any

business in future. All 652 students are housed in different hostels
including Model Block and 14 other hostels. Each house includes a
warden and Aya who perform paternal duties and take good care of
the children to make sure that the rooms and the dress of the child is
neat and tidy. Food is also an important element of the Institution in
which a balance and hygienic diet is served to the children in
accordance with the instruction of renowned nutritionists who are
consulted on quarterly basis to suggest changes in the menu
keeping in view the health requirements of the children. After
successful functioning of the Institute at Peshawar, the Provincial
Government has planned to extend the facilities to the
disenfranchised, destitute and vulnerable children of the other
districts. For this purpose a PC.1 titled, “Establishment of Boys
Campuses of Model Institute for the State Children in District Swat,
Dera Ismail Khan, Abbottabad and Girls Campus at Peshawar has
also been approved at a total cost of 365.982 Million for a period of
three years. In the report the achievements of the Institution
“Zamung Kor” for the welfare of the children has also been
highlighted in detail. With the report daily schedule of the children
has also been annexed.
7. It is uncontroverted fact that child begging has become a
raising menace throughout the world. In the third world countries
the main reason behind this menace is the poverty and lack of
/ education facilities, particularly, in the rural areas. On one side
stringent law is need of the time to curb the menace of vagrancy,
while on the other side, Institutions Like “Zamung Kor” are

required to be promoted, surely, the civil Society and the
Government shall play greater role creating awareness in the
masses about Muslim Laws and commandments regarding imperial
effect of vagrancy. We appreciate the struggles and functions of
“Zamung Kor” being conducted and carried out for rehabilitation of
children. The Institution besides providing food, shelter and
education is trying to train the children for their future life. In case

in hand, parents of the child were summoned and informed about
better welfare of their ward in Zamung Kor, however, their only
request was that the child be allowed some time to stay with them.

We are conscious of the love and affection of parents and children
towards each other, however, welfare of the child is the prime
consideration under the law. In view of the above discourse and
report of “Zamung Kor, coupled with the feeble financial position

of parents of the child and his welfare in the Institution “Zamong
Kor” we are of the firm view to hold that it would be in the best
interest of the child’s future to stay in the above named Institution
instead of handing him over in the custody of the appellant, in
which circumstances there is no guarantee of his better future. The
learned trial court has rightly turned down the request of the
appellant to which no exception can be taken, however, keeping in’
mind the love and affection of the parents, we deem it appropriate

. and in the interest of justice to provide a visitation right to the child

é l stay with his parents on each off day in the week.

r 8. Accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed with the
observation that parents of child Obaid Ullah shall be entitled to

visit and see him in “Zamung Kor” on any day of the week inside
the Institution, whereas, they would be entitled to his custody for
shifting him to home on Saturday of each week after his school
timing and shall be bound to return him to the Institution on coming
Monday before 9.00 A.M. provided the petitioner furnishes bail
bond in the sum of rupees one lac with one surety in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the learned Child Protection Court,
Peshawar.
