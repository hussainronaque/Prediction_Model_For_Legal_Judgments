Cr.P.C.

2. The complainant-party has also preferred

connected Cr.R No.70-M/2019 titled ‘Naik Muhammad

Vs. Bakht Anwar_and 03 others’ against the same
impugned judgment of the learned trial Court seeking
enhancement of the above sentence of the appellants,
therefore, we would decide both these matters through

this single judgment.

3. On 17.01.2014 at 20:00 hours, complainant
Naik Muhammad (PW-12) at his house reported the
matter before the police in presence of dead body of his
daughter Mst. Zakia to the effect that on the eventful
day, he went to mosque for maghrib prayer. On hearing
noise, returned home and saw that his daughter Mst.

Zakia was lying dead being murdered while his wife

Mst. Shahmina was lying in injured condition. Injured

Mst. Shamina was shifted to the hospital. The

complainant was informed by inmates of the house that

the appellants entered his house and fired at his wife and
daughter, as:a result of which, his daughter Mst. Zakia
died on spot while his wife Mst. Shahmina sustained
injuries. Motive behind the occurrence was stated that
deceased Mst. Zakia was engaged to appellant Bakht
Anwar in childhood and in exchange thereof, one Mst.
Khairon d/o Nasib Zaman was engaged to Noor
Muhammad (son of complainant) but due to strained
relations between the parties, both the engagements were
broken. Womenfolk of the house were cited as
eyewitnesses to the occurrence. This report of the
complainant (PW-12) was reduced into writing in shape
of murasila (Ex.PW3/1) by Muhammad Ali Inspector
(PW-3). On receipt of murasila at Police Station, its |
contents were incorporated into F.I.R (Ex.PW4/1) by

Fazal Rahim Inspector (PW-4).

4 Injury sheet (Ex.PW3/2) and inquest report

(Ex.PW3/3) of deceased Mst. Zakia were prepared by
PW-3 and thereafter same alongwith dead body were
sent to Hospital for medical examination. On same day,

injured Mst. Shamina also succumbed to injuries and

accordingly section 324 P.P.C was deleted from record
of the case. Injury sheet (Ex.PW10/1) and inquest report
(Ex.PW10/2) deceased then injured Shamina were
prepared by Wakil Zada Khan (PW-10). The dead bodies
of both the deceased were examined by lady Dr. Shah
Bano (PW-2) at District Headquarter Hospital Daggar,
Buner vide medico-legal reports Ex.PW2/] & Ex.PW2/2.
Investigating Officer prepared site plan Ex.PB on
pointation of the complainant and eyewitnesses. During
spot inspéction, blood stained earth etc were taken into
possession from place of deceased Mst. Zakia through

Anwar, five empties of 7.62 bore (Ex.P6) from place of
presence of appellant Bakht Amin and five empties of
7.62 bore (Ex.P7) from place of presence of appellant

Muhammad Anwar were also taken into possession.

therefore challan for proceedings w/s 512 Cr.P.C was
submitted against them and on completion of

proceedings in their absentia, they were declared

-5-
proclaimed offenders and perpetual warrant of arrest was

issued against them by the then learned trial Court vide

order dated 05.05.2014.

On 14.12.2016, appellant Muhammad Anwar
was arrested by Riaz Khan SHO (PW-6) vide his card of

the place of occurrence to the I.O vide pointation memo
Ex.PW15/l. On completion of his investigation,

18.04.2017, appellant Bakht Anwar was also arrested in
Karachi u/s 54 Cr.P.C and accordingly he was
transferred to District Buner in this case. During
interrogation, he allegedly led the I.O to the crime scene
vide pointation memo Ex.PWI11/1. Crime weapon was
also recovered on his pointation in presence of marginal
witnesses from his house vide recovery memo
Ex.PW11/2. On completion of his investigation,

the learned trial Court. On 21.06.2017, a joint formal

’ charge was framed against both the arrested appellants
namely Muhammad Anwar and Bakht Anwar. However,
during their trial, on 23.02.2018, appellant Bakht Amin

accordingly, he was also transferred to District Buner in
this case. During his interrogation, he pointed out the
place of incident to ILO vide pointation memo
Ex.PW16/4 while pictures of pointation proceedings are
Ex.PW16/5. Crime weapon was also recovered on his

completion of his investigation, supplementary chalaln
was submitted against him. On 31.07.2019, all the three
appellants were jointly charge sheeted, to which, they

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

| In order to substantiate its case against the
present appellants/convicts, the prosecution produced
and examined as many as 18 witnesses. Lal Said Shah
Khan S.I who has conducted investigation prior to the
arrest of the appellants was reported dead. In this regard,
statement of the concerned D.F.C as CW-1 is placed on
file. On acceptance of the request of the prosecution,
earlier statement of said dead PW Lal Said Shah Khan
S.I recorded during proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C was
transposed in the trial against the appellants. Then
statements of the appellants were recorded u/s 342,

Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the prosecution allegations,

Sabz ays] oe: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTLAQ IBRAHIM
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE WIGAR AHMAD
-7-
however they neither wished to be examined on oath nor

desired to produce evidence in defence.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the appellants were
convicted and sentenced by the learned trial Court as
stated above vide its judgment dated 10.08.2019, hence,
this criminal appeal and the connected criminal revision

petition.

6. Arguments heard and record of the case
perused with the valuable assistance of learned counsel

for the parties and learned Assistant A.G representing the

State.

7. It is case of the prosecution against the
appellants that on 17.01.2014 at 17:30 hours, they
entered the house of complainant and committed
murders of his daughter Mst. Zakia and wife Mst.
Shamina through firing. Breaking of engagements of
appellant Bakht Anwar with deceased Mst. Zakia and of
one Mst. Khairon with Noor Muhammad (son of
complainant) due to strained relations between the
parties was disclosed as motive behind the occurrence. In
support of its allegations against the appellants, the

prosecution mainly relies upon ocular account furnished

by the eyewitnesses namely Mst. Khaman Bibi and Said

Sabz Ati/* DB: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM.
-8-
Khan. They have been examined during trial before the
learned trial Court as PW-13 & PW-14, respectively.
Mst. Khaman Bibi (PW-13) is a rustic/uneducated
female while Said Khan (PW-14) is a farmer by
profession. The complainant has also been examined as
PW-12 before the learned trial Court. From critical
‘analysis of their statements, it appears that their
testimonies are trustworthy, confidence inspiring and
unimpeachable, as on all the materials points they have
remained‘ consistent. Their testimonies are also fully in
line with the initial prosecution version as well as the site
plan. Needless to note here that the occurrence had taken
place or 17.01.2014 whereas all the three prime
prosecution witnesses have been examined by the
prosecution, after a considerable time on 25.06.2019,
before the learned trial Court, despite that they are in .
conformity with each other qua time and place of
occurrence beside being unanimous regarding all other
events having relevancy with the incident, for instance in
the initial report as well as in his statement before the
Court, the complainant (PW-12) asserts that at the
relevant time, he went to the mosque for maghrib prayer
but on hearing noise returned home. This assertion has
been confirmed by both the eyewitnesses (PW-13 &

PW-14) in their respective statements. The complainant

Sabz aiy| DB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAG IBRAHIM
HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
-9-
(PW-12) is also unanimous with the eyewitnesses (PW-
13 & PW-14) on certain other crucial points of the
matter, such as the approximate distance between their
house and mosque where the complainant has gone for
maghrib prayer before the incident and time of arrival of
complainant to the house. In view of simple-minded
nature of the PWs even not knowing the consequences of
some answers by them, the eyewitnesses (PW-13 & PW-
14) have given confirmatory answers to the questions put
to them by defence in a perplexing manner as the female
eyewitness (PW-13) states to have not made any
consultation before lodging the report. This fact has also
been confirmed by PW-3, the scriber of the report
(Ex.PW3/1) by stating that before approaching the house
of the complainant, he did not get any detail about the
occurrence from any other person on way. Despite of
confronting these eyewitnesses, during their cross
examination by the defence in a very confusing manner,
their testimonies could not be shattered by the defence
that the occurrence has not taken place in the alleged
mode and manner as they have successfully explained
that the incident has taken place inside the house of the
complainant. Both these eyewitnesses are the residents
of the spot house as PW-13 is daughter-in-law of the

complainant while PW-14 is son of the complainant,

Sabr aiy>| DB: HON’BLE MIR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM,

HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
-10-

therefore, in absence of their any disintegration in their
testimonies to doubt their presence on the spot at the
relevant time, their presence was natural on the spot at
the relevant time. The entire testimony of these
eyewitnesses of the incident could not be shattered by
the defence besides upon careful scanning of the
prosecution evidence, there could not be noticed even a
single occasion on the entire record to render their
presence on spot at the relevant time doubtful. Though
there are certain minor contradictions in the statements
of the PWs but same, in our considered view, would not
go to the roots of the case to shake the truthfulness of the
witnesses and thus same are excluded from consideration
in the peculiar circumstances of the case. Moreso, there
is nothing on record which would-transpire that the PWs
had any motive to falsely implicate the accused in the
case, therefore, their established natural presence on the
spot at the relevant time could not be brushed aside on
the ground of their mere close relationship with the
deceased. In this respect, reliance may also be placed on
judgment in the case of “Zafar Igbal and others V/s. The
State” reported as 2014 SCMR 1227 wherein it was held

by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that:

“Mere relationship of prosecution witnesses
with deceased cannot render their evidence

Sabr Aly* os: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
HON'BLE MR JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD.

-li-

unreliable unless it is established that they had
motive to implicate accused falsely”.

8. Time of incident in the report has been shown
as 17:30 hours (sham vela) by the complainant (PW-12) .
It has also been confirmed by PWs that at the time of
occurrence, the complainant (PW-12) has left the house
for maghrib prayer. Sunset time during relevant days at
District Buner was about 05:24 pm. No doubt, the report
has been lodged by the complainant at 20:00 hours in his
house, however, the place where the occurrence has
taken place is a hilly area as admittedly a considerable
distance has been covered by the police through walk
while approaching the place of incident for lodging the
report, after receipt of the information. Record shows
distance between the spot and police station is 12/13
| kms. It is not clear from the available record that how
much distance was covered through vehicle and how
much through walk by the police who at the time of
receipt of information was on patrolling duty. In absence _
of any question regarding the said distance, a strong
presumption would always exist that distance of place
where the police has received information qua the
incident would be more than the distance of the police
station and the ‘spot shown in the F.ILR by the

prosecution. It is also on record that soon after the

Sabz aiys| 8: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
HON'BLE MA. JUSTICE WIDAR AHMAD
-12-
occurrence, deceased then injured Mst. Shamina was
shifted to the hospital and as she was being shifted in
injured condition, therefore, the persons shifting her
would have made immediate arrangements for her
shifting to hospital without wasting any time. She has
been mentioned as injured in the initial report by the
complainant and has succumbed on the way to the
hospital. On same day at 09:10 hours, her dead body was
examined by the doctor (PW-2). So, it appears that
shifting of deceased then injured Mst. Shamina from the
mountairious area to the hospital would have taken
sufficient time. The I.O (PW-16) also affirmed that
house of the complainant is situated in a hilly area.
Therefore, keeping in mind the spot being located in
difficult hilly area and its inter se distance from place of
presence of the police where they received information,
the arrival of police to the spot and recording report of
the complainant at 20:00 hours qua the incident, would
be considered as a promptly lodged report without any
undue delay, excluding the probabilities of deliberation
and consultation of false implication of the accused as
well as substitution of real culprit in light of the
established presence of the eyewitnesses on the spot at
" the relevant time. The time of occurrence has also been

corroborated by the medical evidence furnished by the

Sabz aiy| ob: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE WIOAR AHMAD

-13-
prosecution through lady doctor (PW-2). The medical
evidence also confirms that death of both the deceased
was as a result of sustaining firearm injuries by them.
Hence, the medical evidence is also in line with the

prosecution version.

9. Breaking of engagements of ‘appellant Bakht
Anwar with deceased Mst. Zakia and of one Mst.
Khairon with Noor Muhammad (son of complainant) due
to subsequent strained relations between the parties was
alleged as a motive behind the occurrence. Same is duly
mentioned in the initial report by the complainant. It has
also been confirmed by relevant PWs in their statements
before the Court. This motive has also been admitted by
appellant Bakht Anwar in his statement recorded u/s 342
Cr.P.C. However, the defence has failed to elicit
desirable answers from mouths of the PWs qua certain
questions put to them to falsify the alleged motive. The
motive was directly related to appellant Bakht Anwar
and same has also been proved by the prosecution

through confidence inspiring evidence.

10. The crime weapon (Kalashnikov) was also
recovered on pointation of the appellant Bakht Anwar
from his house vide pointation/recovery memo

Ex.PW11/2. Site sketch of said recovery is Ex.PW15/6.

Sabz ays OB: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
-14-
With regard to the recovery of this crime weapon, the”
testimonies of the F.C Ajmal Said (PW-11) and Hashim
Ali Khan ASI (PW-15) could not be shattered by the
defence during their cross examination. The matching
report (Ex.PW15/10) of F.S.L regarding the crime
Kalashnikov and crime empties, which were taken into
possession from place of appellant Bakht Anwar, is also
supporting the prosecution version against appellant
Bakht Anwar. He has also absconded for sufficient long
period and during period of his abscondence, all
proceedings requiring to be carried out against a fugitive,
were completed in his absentia and even he was declared
as proclaimed offender. In peculiar facts &
circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that he was
not having knowledge of his nomination as accused in
present case. As he has failed to plausibly explain his
abscondence, therefore, same is to be used against him as

a corroboratory piece of evidence. In this regard, reliance

is placed on the case of ‘Qaiser Khan and other Vs. The

State and others’ (2009 SCMR 471), wherein the august

Supremé Court of Pakistan has held that;

“Long abscondence of accused without
any plausible and reasonable explanation
indicates his guilt, when considered in
conjunction with the ocular and
circumstantial evidence.”

11. Adverting to the case of rest of the two
appellants/convicts namely Bakht Amin and Muhammad
Amin. Record shows that the motive is not directly
related to: them. Though, they have been assigned the
role of firing at the deceased, however, report of the
F.S.L (Ex.PW16/9) regarding the crime weapon
recovered on pointation of appellant Bakht Amin with
crime empties allegedly taken into possession during
spot inspection from the place of his presence is in
negative, whereas no recovery of incriminating article
has been effected either from possession or on pointation
of appellant Muhammad Anwar during the course of
investigation. It is a cardinal principle of criminal justice
that a person who is sought to be held liable for doing a
criminal act with a specific role, his role in that particular
manner must be established on record by the prosecution
through confidence inspiring evidence, which is missing
in this case to the extent of appellants Bakht Amin and
Bakht Anwar. Even in this case, nothing has been
brought on record by the prosecution, which could at
least, deduce preconcert of both the appellants in the
commission of offence showing their criminal intent,
which is prime requirement of section 34 P.P.C. The
. existence of above facts on the record would clearly

create reasonable doubts in a prudent mind regarding

Sabz auye| o8: HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IGRAHIM
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD

-16-
their participation in the crime. In peculiar circumstances
of the case, it would not be out of place to note here that
appellants Bakht Amin and Bakht Anwar are brothers
inter-se. According to their statements recorded u/s 342
Cr.P.C, Bakht Amin is about 11/12 years elders than
Bakht Anwar. We see no convincing reason in the entire
prosecution evidence that how it is possible for an elder
brother to join hands with his younger brother in such a
crime. Even otherwise, in light of the above evidence the
commission of crime would be the doing of one person
and to that effect that prosecution has successfully
discharged its burden of proving the offence against
appellant Bakht Anwar. It is noteworthy to highlight here
that these factors in the case favouring appellants Bakht
Amin and Muhammad Anwar would create no suspicion
in establishing the presence of the eyewitnesses on the
spot at the relevant time, however, same would only
show a reasonable possibility in our mind that
participation of appellants Bakht Amin and Muhammad
Anwar has not been proved by the prosecution to the hilt,
as such, for safe administration of justice they are
entitled to benefit of said doubt. At times, Court extends
benefit of doubt to some of accused as abundant caution
that will not signify that the witnesses were not credible.

Hence, we hold that the learned trial Court has not

Sabz atv"| DB: HON’BLE MA. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD
eS.

-17-
properly evaluated the prosecution evidence to the extent

of appellants Bakht Amin and Bakht Anwar while

. awarding them the impugned punishment.

12. By evaluating the facts and circumstances of the
case, we hold that to the extent of appellant Bakht Anwar
the learned trial Court has rightly awarded him life
imprisonment but in the impugned judgment the learned
trial Court has inadvertently not mentioned two counts,
otherwise it was held that charge of murder of two
deceased Mst. Zakia and Mst. Shamina has been proved

against appellant Bakht Anwar.

13. For what has been discussed above, this appeal
is dismissed to the extent of appellant-convict Bakht
Anwar and impugned conviction & sentences awarded to
him by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/MCTC,
District Buner, through judgment dated 10.08.2019 in
case F.].R No.19 dated 17.01.2014 registered under
sections 302/449/34 P.P.C and section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, at Police Station
Gulbandi, District Buner, are maintained. Since, two
persons have died as a result of firing of appellant Bakht
Anwar, therefore, it is clarified that u/s 302 (b) P.P.C,
appellant Bakht Anwar shall undergo life imprisonment
on two counts, with direction to him to pay Rs.800,000/-

as compensation to the legal heirs of each deceased

Sabz aw| D8: HON'BLE MA. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM.

HON’BLE MRLJUSTICE WIQAR AHMAD,
-18-
within the meaning of section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default
to undergo 06 months S.I each. it is further clarified that
in default of sentence of payment of fine awarded u/s

449 P.P.C to appellant Bakht Anwar, he shall undergo 02 .

months S.J. All his substantive sentences shall run

concurrently with benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C,
whereas this appeal to the extent of appellants-convicts
Bakht Amin Muhammad Anwar is allowed by extending
them benefit of doubt. Resultantly, ibid impugned
judgment to the extent of appellants-convicts Bakht
Amin and Muhammad Anwar is set aside and they are
acquitted of the charges. Appellants Bakht Amin and

Muhammad Anwar be released forthwith from jail if not

required in any other case.

14. Consequently, the connected Cr.R_ No.70-
M/2019 owing to the above reasons is meritless, which is
accordingly dismissed.

15. These are the reasons of our short order of the
even date.
