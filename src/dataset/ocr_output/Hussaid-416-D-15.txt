JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 01.02.2016
Appellant-petitioner Hussaid by
Mr. Bahadar Khan Marwat advocate
Respondent State and another by
Mr. Adnan Ali Assistant A.G for State and Ch: Javed Akhtar for
advocate complainant
MUHAMMAD GHAZANFAR KHAN, J.- Through the
instant petition under section 497(5) Cr.P.C, the petitioner
Hussaid through his mother Mst. Samreen Bibi seeks
cancellation of bail granted to accused/respondent Gul
Zaman by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan
vide order dated 22.12.2015, in case FIR No.175 dated
25.8.2015 registered under sections 302/324/34 PPC at

police station Yarik, District D.I.Khan.

2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on
25.8.2015 at 1230 hours, Rizwanullah complainant
reported the matter in the emergency room of civil
hospital, D.I-Khan to the effect that on the same date, he
was present in his house when got telephonic information
that his father has been fired at 1100 hours on Dera-

Bannu road by two persons riding on a motorcycle and he
-2-

is being taken to Civil Hospital, D.I.Khan. On this
information, the complainant reached there and found his
father dead and his brother Hussain aged about 5/6 years
injured. He charged unknown two persons for
commission of offence. However, on 05.9.2015, he
recorded his supplementary statement under section 161
Cr.P.C and charged the accused/petitioner and his

companion Fatehullah for commission of the offence.

3. The learned counsel for petitioner mainly
contended that petitioner was injured in the incident but
was not made party in the bail petition, therefore, the bail
granting order is against the principles of law as it is
mandatory to give notice to aggrieved person. He relied

on the case of Mohammad Shafig. Vs. Mohammad Mir

Khan and 3 others (2004 P.Cr.L.J_ Peshawar 968).

4. As against that, the learned counsel for
respondent No.2 contended that the petitioner was not
charged by name in the initial report but was charged in
the supplementary statement of the complainant recorded
after 10/11 days of the occurrence; that nothing
incriminating was recovered from possession of the
petitioner and that the complainant was duly represented
by his learned counsel while granting bail to respondent,

therefore, the impugned order is based on sound reasons.
5. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel

for the parties and have gone through the record.

6. Admittedly, the respondent was not directly
charged in the FIR but was subsequently charged by the
complainant in his supplementary statement recorded
after 10/11 days of the occurrence. The evidentiary value
of such statement will be determined at the trial. Neither
the respondent has confessed his guilt nor anything
incriminating has been recovered from his possession or
on his pointation. These factors, on tentative assessment,
make the case of respondent arguable for the purpose of
bail. The contention of learned counsel for petitioner, that
the petitioner being injured/aggrieved person was neither
made party in the bail petition nor was given opportunity
of being heard, is misconceived. Admittedly, the
petitioner is minor brother of complainant and
complainant was duly represented by his learned counsel
when the bail petition of respondent was being argued.
Moreover, the interest of complainant and the petitioner is
one and the same as he is alleged to have received injuries
in the incident where his father lost his life. Proviso to
section 497(1) Cr.P.C envisages that “a person accused
of an offence as aforesaid shall not be released on bail

unless the prosecution has been given notice to show
-4-

cause why he should not be so released.” The word
“prosecution” includes complainant party because it has
no direct interest in the case. The case law relied upon by
learned counsel for the petitioner is distinguishable from
the facts of the instant case. The basic authority on the
point was rendered in the case of Muhammad Ashraf.

Vs. Duarriyaman_and_another_(PLD_1993 Peshawar

151) wherein it was held that:-

“While relying on these observations, I am not

unmindful of the right of an accused person

whose case is not covered by the prohibitory

clause of section 497 Cr.P.C that he is entitled

to bail as of right. What I am emphasizing is

that the State and the complainant,

particularly under the new dispensation of

justice, are certainly entitled to a notice to

grant bail to such an accused.”
It has not been held in the above referred ruling that
notice to injured is also necessary but the State and
complainant have been held entitled to a notice in cases
covered by Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, 1991. In the garb
of above cited case law, the matters pertaining to bail are
being delayed. In the instant case, the State and the

complainant were properly given notice and the bail

petition was argued on their behalf.

7. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition being bereft of any merit and substance is hereby
dismissed.

Announced.
