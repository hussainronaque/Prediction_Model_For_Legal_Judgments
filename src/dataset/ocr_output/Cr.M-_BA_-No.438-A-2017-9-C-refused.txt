SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-
Muhammad Afzaal, accused-petitioner, seeks his
post arrest bail in case FIR No.130 dated 27.03.2017,
under section 9-C Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
1997 registered at Police Station Khan Pur, Haripur.

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner is that on 27.03.2017 at 1200 hours, he
was found in possession of 5000 grams of ‘charas’
and 260 grams of heroin, kept in a plastic sack
carrying by him in his hand at ‘Link Road Pind Gakhra
Usman Khattar’.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties heard and record perused with their able

assistance.
4. The perusal of the record transpires that
a huge quantity of contraband ‘chars’ and ‘heroin’
was recovered from personal possession of the
accused/petitioner, which, prima facie, connects the
petitioner with the commission of offence falling
within the prohibition contained in section 497 of
Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. Moreover, there is
also past history of the accused/petitioner regarding
his indulgence in such like offences, which suggests
that he is a habitual offender. Similarly, the report of
Forensic Science Laboratory, Peshawar regarding the
‘chars’ and heroin’ recovered from possession of
accused-petitioner is also in positive. Keeping in view
the above stated facts and circumstances of the case
in hand, the present accused/petitioner failed to
make out any prima facie case for his release on bail,
therefore, this Court is not inclined to exercise its
discretion to release the accused/petitioner on bail at
this stage.

5. The observations rendered hereinabove,
would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any

manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.
6. Accordingly, this bail application of the
accused/petitioner is rejected. However, the learned
trial Court is directed to proceed with the trial

expeditiously, in accordance with law.
