Cr.R 73-M/2017
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 26.10.2017
Petitioners: (Said Zamin & others) by
Mr. Sardar Abdul Hakim Tajik,

Advocate.

Respondents: (State) by Muhammad Rahim Shah,
Assistant Advocate General.

(Complainant) by Mr. Ikramullah Khan,

Advocate
ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This Criminal Revision
under section 439 Cr.P.C is directed against the
judgment dated 20.5.2015 rendered by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi,
Samarbagh District Dir Lower, whereby the
judgment dated 10.7.2014 of the Assistant
Commissioner/S.D.M, Samarbagh District Lower
Dir regarding conviction of the Petitioners under
section 447 PPC of Rs.500/- each or in default of

payment of fine to undergo 05 days S.I, was upheld.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on

23.10.2012, complainant Sardar Khan approached

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
Assistant Commissioner/ Sub-Divisional
Magistrate, Samarbagh through written application
complaining that the Petitioners being influential
professional litigants are making interference in the
decreed landed property of the complainant to
dispossess him, by extending life threats and if
preventive action under the law against the
Petitioners is not taken, then there is the likelihood
of creation of blood-shed between the parties. This
application was marked to the SHO Police Station
Samarbagh for taking legal action, who further
marked the same to Javed Khan IHC for conducting
an inquiry in the matter. In light of the report of the
inquiry officer, the Assistant Commissioner/ Sub-
Divisional Magistrate ordered the registration of the
case against the Petitioners, hence, case vide FIR
No.68 dated 27.01.2012 under sections 447/34 PPC
at Police Station Samarbagh, District Dir Lower
was registered against the Petitioners. After
completion of the investigation, challan was
submitted. The Petitioners were charge sheeted,

wherein they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM

order to bring home guilt against the Petitioners, the
prosecution examined as many as seven (07)
witnesses followed by the statements of the accused
under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed
their innocence, however, they neither wished to be
examined on oath nor desired to produce evidence
in their defence. Thereafter, both the parties
submitted written arguments and ultimately vide
judgment dated 19.11.2012 of the learned Assistant
Commissioner/SDM, the Petitioners were convicted
and sentenced as stated above. Feeling aggrieved,
the Petitioners preferred an appeal bearing No.3/10
of 2012 before the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi, Samarbagh, which was
accepted. The judgment 19.11.2012 was set aside
and the case was remanded to the learned trial Court
with the directions to rewrite judgment keeping in
mind the provision of section 367 Cr.P.C. After
remand, the learned trial Court, after discussing the
evidence at length, again convicted the Petitioners
under section u/s 447 PPC and sentenced them to

fine of Rs.500/- each or in default of payment of

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAS RAHIM
fine, each accused shall undergo 01 month S.I vide
judgment dated 10.7.2014, whereagaint, the
Petitioners filed an appeal before the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi,
Samarbagh, but the same was also dismissed vide
judgment dated 20.5.2015 recorded in Criminal

Appeal No.5/10 of 2014, hence, this appeal.

Ie

Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Learned counsel for the petitioners
contended that the learned trial Court as well as the
learned Appellate Court failed to appreciate the
evidence and other materials in shape of the record
of previous civil litigation between the parties; that
the learned Assistant Commissioner was not
competent authority to register a criminal case
against the petitioners and by ordering so, grave
miscarriage of justice has been caused to the
petitioners; that the complainant side has concealed
all the material facts from this the Hon’ble Courts
and that by way of registration of the instant criminal
case against the petitioners, the complainant has

converted the civil litigation into criminal by

SabzAli/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
filing complaint against the petitioners. He
concluded that the judgments of both the learned
Courts are suffering from mis-reading and non-
reading of evidence, therefore, the same are not
sustainable and requested for setting aside the
impugned judgments. In support of his contentions,
he placed reliance on the judgments reported as 2017
SCMR 56, 1986 PCr.LJ 953 [Dacca], 2012
PCr.LJ 1770 [Sindh], 2008 PCrLJ 812 [Lahore],
1983 PCr.LJ 42 [Karachi], 2001 MLD 1089
[Peshawar], 2001 PCrLJ 585 [Peshawar], 2006

PCr.LJ 476 [Karachi], PLD 1960 Dacca 631.

5. Learned counsel for the
respondent/complainant strongly repelled the
arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners by
contending that act of the petitioners clearly
constituted a cognizable offence; that despite
decisions of civil Courts in favour of the
complainant, the petitioners have entered upon the
property of the complainant, which act of the
petitioners not only amounts to criminal trespass but

also amounts to the contempt of Court; that the

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM.

petitioners are high-handed persons and in view of
the inquiry report of the inquiry officer followed by
trustworthy and confidence inspiring evidence, the
petitioners have rightly been convicted by the
learned trial Court. He requested for dismissal of the

revision petition.

6. Learned Assistant Advocate

representing the State supported the contentions

made by the learned counsel for the complainant.

7. The first and foremost question for
determination before this Court is that as to whether
in view of the allegations against the
Petitioners/convicts in the application of the
complainant followed by the inquiry report of the
inquiry officer and the evidence recorded before the
learned trial Court can reasonably constitute an
offence which amounts to criminal trespass or
otherwise. For such purpose, I would like to refer
herein below the wordings which constitute
criminal trespass as defined in section 441 of the

Pakistan Penal Code.

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
“441. Criminal trespass. Whoever enters
into or upon property in possession of
another with intent to commit an offence or
to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in
possession of such property, or having
lawfully entered into or upon such
property, unlawfully remains there with
intent thereby to intimidate, insult or any
such person, or with intent to commit an
offence is said to commit “criminal

trespass”.

8. The recommendation of the inquiry officer
that the petitioners have allegedly started construction
work on the property of the complainant is incredible
for the reason that the complainant Sardar Khan (PW-6)
and the other prosecution witnesses examined as PW-1,
PW-2 and PW-3 stated that the petitioners were
illegally occupying landed property of the complainant
side by digging ditch and carrying out construction
thereon, but the initial complaint, on the basis of which
the whole proceedings were set in motion, is totally
mute regarding this aspect of the case. They have not
disclosed that the construction was being carried out
by the petitioners. This development in the case
seems to be afterthought and  malafide.

Moreover, as to whether every unlawful entry, on the

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) )N*| M ICE ISHTIAQ I
property of a person in possession, amounts to criminal
trespass or not as according to section 441 PPC entry
into the property in the possession of another must be
with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult
or annoy any person in possession of such property. In
the present case, allegations of the complainant against
the Petitioners are that they have entered the property of
the complainant by starting construction thereon, but
looking into the wordings of essential ingredients of
section 441 PPC, mere constructive possession would
not be sufficient as a person in absentia cannot be said
to be intimidated, insulted or annoyed and such person
had to be named by the prosecution in order to sustain
the charge of criminal trespass. The difference between
civil and criminal trespass has been made clear in the
judgment reported as 2013 P.Cr.R (R. Pindi) 334 (a).
The relevant portion the judgment is reproduced herein

below for the sake of convenience.

“There is difference between civil
trespass by way of taking possession of
the property without the consent of the
person in possession and criminal
trespass for which insult or annoyance
to the person in possession of such

property is condition precedent.”

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. ISH i IM
Since, there is no mention of the presence

of the complainant party on the spot at the relevant time

when the petitioners were allegedly taking possession

of the landed property of the complainant, therefore, the

element of criminal trespass is missing here. In this

respect, wisdom is derived from the judgment reported

as PLD 1965 Supreme Court 640, wherein the

following view has been taken.

“....A person who is in possession may be
absent from the property and his rival
claimant may come and enter into
possession; he may actually lock it from
inside. But whether he locks it or not there
would be no method of turning him out if
his intention is just to dispossess his rival
and not to annoy him. The person in
possession will have to file a suit if he
wants to eject him, but if after years of he
gets a decree and the decree is executed he
will gain no advantage for the next day
again the opposite-party can enter the
property and the same process will have to

be repeated”.

Remedy available after the commission of

civil trespass is the way of filing of the civil suit against

the trespasser.

9. Moreover, Muhammad Javed IHC is the
inquiry officer, who has played a pivotal role in the
matter in order to find the truth, has been examined as
PW-4 in the learned trial Court. His report in this regard
is Ex PW4/8, on the basis whereof the learned Sub-
Divisional Magistrate has ordered stopping the
construction work and registration of a case against the
Petitioners. Inquiry report Ex PW4/8 in a place shows
that:

Name of Ghulam Dost does not appear
in the application as applicant rather he has
witnessed only the recovery memo, whereby the
Inquiry Officer has taken into his possession
decision of the Court relating to the civil disputes
between the parties. He in the cross examination has
stated to have recorded statements of the
eyewitnesses but neither any such statement is
available on the case file nor the names of the
eyewitnesses are mentioned in the inquiry report nor
in the initial application filed by the complainant for

taking legal action against the petitioners.

10. Another important aspect of the case is
that civil cases are pending in between the parties,
but this factor has been ignored by the trial Court
while recording the conviction of the appellant for
the offence of criminal trespass. Learned Appellate
Court has also ignored the relevant law on the point
while upholding the judgment of conviction of the
appellants. Reliance is placed on the case of “ Takri

Moosa Khan Vs. The State and another” reported

as 1998 MLD 1838 (Quetta) wherein it has been

held that:

“It appears that controversy was that of a
civil nature which has been converted into
criminal proceedings without examining
the crux of the matter by the learned trial
Court which resulted in grave miscarriage
of justice on the one hand and petitioner
suffered agony of protracted trial on the
other hand and in such view of the matter
re-writing of judgment or remand of the

case would not serve any useful purpose.

11. It may be well that in doing a particular
act a man may have more intentions than one. To
bring a case within section 441 PPC, the intention
specified therein must be the dominant intention. If

the primary intention is something other than to

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM
-12-

intimidate, insult or annoy, the section does not
apply. Thus, where the primary and dominant
intention of the accused was to take possession of
the property, and entering into the property, they
must have been conscious that annoyance to the
complainant might be a natural and inevitable
consequence of their action, but that was not the
purpose with which they had entered into the
property, they could not be convicted under section
441 PPC. Reliance is placed on PLD 1952 Dacca

261, wherein the following view has been laid down.

“Every unlawful entry does not
amount to criminal trespass. The
essence of section 441 PPC which
defines criminal trespass is the intent
with which the entry is made and in
every case the intent must be either to
commit an offence or to intimidate,
insult or any person in possession of
such property. The section does not
penalize unlawful entry with any
other intent, such as mere intent to
take possession. The Court must
come to a clear finding that the entry
with one or more of the intents
mentioned in section 411 PPC.

Failure to come to such finding

Sabz Ali/* (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM

-13-

amounts to failure to decide a vital

point in the case”.

Both the learned Courts below have
failed to keep in mind at the time of rendering the
judgments the crucial point relating to mens-rea or
otherwise of the appellants at the time of the alleged
act, therefore, both the impugned judgments are not

sustainable on this reason as well.

12. It would not be out of place to note here
that determination of the title and the ownership of
the property, it is not the duty of this Court while
seized of the criminal cases as that is the job of the
Civil Court to determine the civil rights of the
parties. At the moment, this Court has to see only
whether any cognizable offence amounting to
criminal trespass is committed by the Petitioners or
not by analyzing the relevant law and the materials
on the case record. However, there is nothing in the
shape of documentary evidence/record nor any
witness has been produced by the prosecution to the
effect that the property in question is the exclusive

ownership of the complainant side. On this ground

Sabz Ali/*  (S.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM

-14-

too, the alleged act of the petitioners does not

amount to criminal trespass.

13. In order to prove the guilt of the
Petitioners of being criminal trespassers, neither the
complainant nor the alleged eyewitnesses have
specified the date and time of the occurrence in their
respective statements recorded before the learned
trial Court. All the witnesses in their respective
statements state that the Petitioners have dug out the
property owned by the complainant for the purpose
of raising construction thereon but they have not
specified the time and date of such act. They have
also not attributed any other act to the petitioners,
which can constitute an offence amounts to criminal
trespass. Moreso, neither the complainant nor the
eyewitness state that they have seen the petitioners
on the spot while digging the earth for the purpose of
construction, therefore, the evidence as well as the
other materials on the record does not make a sense
that the Petitioners have committed an act of
criminal trespass, as such, the conviction of the

Petitioners is not maintainable.

14. In view of the above discussion, all the
essential ingredients to make out a case of criminal
trespass are missing in this case as by the
complainants by no independent and confidence
inspiring source or by producing trustworthy
evidence in support of their stance to substantiate the
criminal intention which could intimidate, annoy or

insult them by the act of the petitioners/convicts.

15. For what has been discussed above, the
learned Courts below have failed to properly
appreciate the evidence on file, therefore, the
impugned judgments are suffering from mis-reading
and non-reading of evidence, as such, the same are
not maintainable. Hence, by setting aside the
impugned judgments, this revision petition is
allowed and the Petitioners/convicts are acquitted of
the charge. They may accordingly withdraw fine

amount if deposited pursuant to the impugned

judgment of the learned trial Court.
