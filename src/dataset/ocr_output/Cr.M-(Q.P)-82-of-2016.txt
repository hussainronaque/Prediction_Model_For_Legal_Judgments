JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR: J.-This single judgment
in the instant petition shall also decide the connected W.P
No.620-M/2016 titled “Habib Ullah and others Vs. Chaman
and others” and W.P_No.625-M/2015 titled “Chaman_and
others Vs. Habit Ullah and others” as an identical question
of law and facts is involved in all the three petitions. The
instant quashment petition and connected W.P_No.620-
M/2016 are the outcome of one and same consolidated
judgment dated 20.08.2016 passed by the learned Sessions

Judge/Zila Qazi, Malakand at Batkhela in Criminal Revision

No.7/10 of 2016 and Misc. Application No.10/04 of 2016,
whereby the petitioners were directed to hand over
possession of the property to the respondents whereas
connected W.P No. 625-M/2015 has been filed by the

25.11.2015 of the learned Sessions Judge, Malakand at

Batkhela in case No.1I/l of 2015 for enhancement of
punishment u/s 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 to
the respondents/ accused. Though the learned counsel for
petitioner contended that the W.P_No.620-M/2016 may be
converted into Criminal Appeal because it was filed in the
year 2016 when no right of appeal against the order passed
on the application under sections 3/8 of Illegal Dispossession
Act, however, keeping in view the amendment and insertion
of section 8-A in the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005. This
contention of the learned Counsel for petitioners is of no
avail to the petitioners because the Criminal Revision of
petitioners was filed against the order by which possession
was handed over to the complainants. Right of appeal under
section 8-A of the Act is restricted to the orders passed under
sub-section 2 & sub-section 3 of section 3 and sub-section 1
of section 8 of the Act. Thus, the request for conversion of
writ petition into Criminal Appeal is hereby turned down.
Insofar as the W.P_No. 625-M_ of 2015 by which the
petitioners have prayed for enhancement of sentence is
appealable u/s 8-A of the Act by dint of the Illegal
Dispossession (Amendment) Act, 2017 on 03.07.2017 (Act
XXVIII of 2017), therefore, the connected W.P_No.625-
M/2015 is hereby converted into criminal appeal. Office

shall do the needful in this respect. Learned Counsel for

Sabz Ali (DB) HON'RLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’ BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD JAZ KHAN

-3-
petitioner in W.P No. 625-M of 2015 submitted that he is

under instruction not to press the petition, therefore, this
petition as converted into appeal stands dismissed being not
“pressed.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioners who are appellants
in connected criminal appeal conterided that respondent No.1
to 4 filed a complaint u/s 3/8 of the Illegal Dispossession
Act, 2005 against the petitioners contending therein that they
have been illegally dispossessed from the property by the
petitioners; that in view of Ex.CW1/5 and the decision of this
Court dated 26.11.2014, the partics are litigating against
each other since 1982 and since then the parties are at dagger
drawn against each other but still the determination of
controversy could only be made through appointment of a
local Commission. He, while referring to civil suit No.24/1
of 1979 decided on 18.11.1979 where a decree for perpetual
injunction was granted, contended that ultimately this suit
was finally decreed to the extent of plot “alif’, which was
held as shamilat and said plot was denoted as “ABCD” (plot
“alif’) measuring 90 feet south, 63 feet north, 89 feet west
and 100 feet east and this judgment was maintained by this
~ Court when C.R_ No.508 of 1992 which was dismissed on
30.11.1994 and C.P.L.A No.76-P of 1995 was dismissed by
the apex Court on 25.12.1997 and leave to appeal was

refused. He also referred to suit titled “Rahmat Khan Vs.

HON'RLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD LIAZ KUIAN

-4-

Chaman_and_ others” wherein Abdul Waris who was
predecessor in interest of the present petitioners was at serial
No.49 in the array of the defendants and contended that once
again the said subject matter was made disputed wherein a
decree was granted being based upon the decision of
“musliheen”’, against which, Civil Appeal No.69/13 of 1998
was filed, which was dismissed on 13.05.1999 by the then
learned District Judge, Malakand. He also referred to certain
objection petitions and contended that the objection of the
petitioners was allowed on 11.09.2004. Ile added that the
respondents have submitted Revenue Suit No.22/ of 2005 for
determination of the boundaries of the property, which was
dismissed on 21.06.2006. Lastly, he submitted that the
impugned order in Criminal Revision No. 07/2010 and
Criminal Miscellaneous No.10/04 of 2016 dated 20.08.2016
whereby the criminal revision of petitioners was against the
order of Assistant Commissioner dated 03.02.2016 sending
the application of respondents to Tchsildar for handing over
the possession to complainants was illegally dismissed. He
maintained that the learned Court below was required to
adhere to the provisions of section 3 & 8 of the Act of 2005
and also the facts of the long litigation between the parties.

3. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents
contended that though there remained civil litigations

between the parties from the trial Court upto the apex Court

Sabz Ali/* (DB) HON’ BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MULIAMMAD BAZ KHAN

-5-

but the act of the petitioners i.e., dispossessing of the
respondents/ complainants from the disputed property on
30.12.2014 was proved through direct and convincing
evidence thus the possession was rightly handed over to the
respondents/ complainants. He added that the respondents
have proved their case beyond any shadow of doubt against
the petitioners, therefore, the instant quashment petition and
the connected petition filed against the respondents deserves
dismissal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It appears from the contents of the complaint filed under
sections 3/8 of the Act of 2005 by the respondents/
complainants that on 30.12.2014, they were illegally
dispossessed from the property by the petitioners. They were
charge sheeted to which they did not plead guilty and
claimed trial. Complainant produced PW-1] Umar Said who
deposed that on 30.12.2014, the respondents/ complainants
were dispossessed from the property by the petitioners/
accused and thereafter they started construction therein. In
cross examination, in response toa question, he deposed that
the description of the property is mentioned in Ex.CW1/5,
which was prepared in civil suit No.24/] of 1979. He was
cross examined at length qua the particulars of the civil
litigations, Ex.CW1/5, Ex.PW1/2, date of decision of the

civil Court, date of the application for determination of

‘Sabz, Ali/* (D.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD WAZ RUAN

-6-

boundaries of the property but it is pertinent to mention here
that not even a single question regarding the dispossession
which was not only mentioned in the complaint but the
witness in his examination-in-chief has reiterated that the
complainants/ respondents were dispossessed on 30.12.2014,
was put to PW-1. Statement of Kamran-ud-Din was recorded
as PW-2, in whose cross examination, too neither any direct
question regarding illegal dispossession of the respondents/
complainants was put to the witness nor it was suggested by
the present petitioners. Lastly, the statement of Hazrat
Muhammad was recorded as PW-3, however, he was not
cross examined despite opportunity was provided to the
petitioners. Thereafter, petitioners Habib Ullah, Hakeem
Ullah, Khalil Ullah, Shakir Ullah, Aziz Ullah, Shafi
Ullah,Shahid Ullah and Noor Muhammad were examined u/s
342, Cr. P.C but once again they professed innocence by
refuting the allegation of prosecution, however, they neither
recorded their own statements on oath in terms of section
340(2), Cr. P.C nor produced any witness in their defence
however, in reply to a question was put to them that since
12.5.1997, the respondents/ complainants are in possession
of the disputed property, to which they replied that it is
incorrect. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide

judgment dated 25.11.2015 allowed the complaint and

SabzAli/* = (.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD LIAZ Kit AN

-7-

directed the petitioner to deliver the possession to
complainants.

6. It is pertinent to mention that the order of learned trial
Court was assailed before this Court through W.P No. 580-
M/2015 by the petitioners but their petition was dismissed in
limine on 09.12.2015. The petitioners being aggrieved filed
Civil Petition for leave to appeal bearing No. 3858 of 2015
before the Hon’ble Supreme Court but their petition was
dismissed and leave was refused on 07.06.2016. In the
meanwhile, earlier to the dismissal of leave to appeal on
08.01.2016 the respondents submitted an application to the
Deputy Commissioner for recovery of possession in term of
the judgment of learned Sessions Judge Malakand at
Batkhela which was marked to Assistant Commissioner
Batkhela for compliance who further marked it to Tehsildar
for implementation and handing over the possession of
property to respondents vide order 03.02.2016. This order
was assailed by the petitioners through their Criminal
Revision No. 07/10 of 2016 before learned Sessions Judge,
Malakand at Batkhela. Learned Sessions Judge issued notices
to both the parties. During proceedings before Sessions Judge
on 20.08.2016 Post Commander Alldand namely Ghafoor
Khan submitted report before Session Court to the effect that
possession of the property has already been transferred, thus,

after hearing the parties, learned Session Judge vide order

Sabz Ali/* (DB) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON‘BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD WAZ KUAN

-8-
dated 20.08.2016 dismissed both Criminal Revision No. 7/10

and Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 10/04 of 2016
through impugned order. The application was dismissed
because the respondents were secking possession of the
property which was handed over to them and the Criminal
revision was dismissed being infructuous.

7. Insofar as the contentions of the petitioners that
boundaries of the property were not property determined as
per Ex CW-1/1 are concerned, suffice it to say that when it is
proved that the petitioners have dispossessed the respondents
and the complaint was decided against the petitioners which
order was maintained by this Court in W.P No.580-M of
2015 dated 09.12.2015 and leave to appeal was dismissed by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court on 07.06.2016, the possession
was rightly transferred to the respondents. There is no force
in the arguments of petitioners regarding the determination of
the boundaries. The petitioners availed all the remedies
available to them but failed to prove their contentions thus,
they cannot be allowed to reopen the matter once again.
Neither the order passed under section 3/8 of Illegal
Dispossession Act 2005 can be amalgamated with the
demarcation as sought by the petitioners nor the criminal
Court could order the demarcation of the property. Learned
Sessions Court was to confine itself with the order passed

and to implement it in letter and spirit. ‘Transfer of possession

Sabz Ali? (DB) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’ BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD IJAZ RITAN

-9-

of the property in term of section 8 of the Act of 2005 was
the domain of Session Judge and the Court has rightly
executed its order. In writ jurisdiction this court will have to
ascertain as to whether the Court has acted in accordance
with law or not. Section 8 of the Act of 2005 deals with the
powers of the Court to deliver the possession of the property

which reads as:

“8. Delivery of possession of property to owner, ete.
(1) On conclusion of trial,.if the Court finds that an

owner or occupier of the property was_ illegally
dispossessed or property was grabbed in contravention
of section 3, the Court may,.at the time of passing order
under sub-sections (2) and (3) of that section, direct the
accused or any person claiming through him for
restoration of the possession of the property to the
owner or, as the case may be, the occupier, if not
already restored to him under section 7.

(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), the Court may,
where it is required, direct the officer-in-charge of the
police station for such assistance as may be required for
restoration ofthe possession of the property to the
owner or, as the case may be, the occupier.”

When it was proved that the owner or occupier was
illegally disposed from his property the Court would transfer
the possession thereof. The impugned order is in consonance
with the mandate of above reproduced section of law.

8. Moreover, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its leave
refusal order dated 07.06.2016 has discussed the illegal
occupation of property be the petitioners from the

respondents. The operative part of the judgment reads as:

“It seems that after the respondents were put in
possession pursuant to the proceedings ended before
this Court, the petitioners have again dispossessed the
respondents by demolishing the pillars. The Courts

Sabz Ali/* (DB) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MURAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD JJAZ KHAN

-10-

below have concurrently found that despite the matter
having been settled upto the level of this Court and
boundary pillars having been installed the petitioners
have illegally removed such boundary pillars and have
taken back possession of the property unlawfully. Such
finding of the Courts below docs not suffer from any
mis-reading and non-reading of material available on
record. Though petitioners’ counsel stated that suit is
pending in civil Court but was unable to show to us as
to what suit was pending in the Civil Court more
particularly in the face of the fact that in the carlier suit
matter came up to this Court where the question of
demarcation was decided. In the complaint under illegal
Dispossession Act, the petitioners have been found to
have unlawfully occupied the property of the
respondents and thus have been directed to deliver it
possession to the respondents.”

9. No doubt, civil litigations remained pending
adjudication before the parties since 1982 but the merely on
the basis of civil litigation neither the proceedings in criminal
mater can be terminated nor the transfer of possession in
term of section 8 of the Act of 2005 can be declared illegal.
This controversy was put to rest by the apex Court in the case
of Shaikh Muhammad Naseem (2016 SCMR 1931) where

it was held:

In the impugned judgment it was also held that where
civil litigation with regard to illegal dispossession from
immoveable property is pending between the parties,
the proceedings under the Iflegal Dispossession Act,
2005 cannot be maintained. This finding is also based
on the decision of the Lahore High Court in Zahoor
Ahmed's case (PLD 2007 Lahore 231, reasoning of
which was adopted by three-member bench of this
Court in Bashir Ahmed's case (PLD 2010 SC 661). We
are of the view that such a finding is also not sustainable
in law. Any act which entails civil liability under civil
law as well as criminal penalty under criminal law, such
as the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 then a person can
be tried under both kinds of proceedings, which are
independent of cach other. Once the offence reported in

Sabz Ali/* (D.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD LIAZ KHAN

-dj-

the complaint stands proved against the accused within
the confines of the provisions of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 then he cannot escape
punishment on the ground that some civil litigation on
the same issue is pending adjudication between the
parties. No one can be allowed to take law in his own
hands and unlawfully dispossess an owner or lawful
occupier of an immovable property and then seck to
thwart the criminal procecdings initiated against him
under the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 on the pretext
that civil litigation on the issuc is pending adjudication
between the parties in a court of law. Therefore,
irrespective of any civil litigation that may be pending
in any Court, where an offence, as described in the
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, has been committed, the
proceedings under the said Act can be initiated as the
same would be maintainable in law

10. In the case of Mst. Gulshan Bibi and others
(PLD 2016 SC 769) the apex Court has observed that:

In view of the above discussion, we conclude that in any
proceedings initiated under Illegal Dispossession Act,
2005, the issues which fall for decision would be
whether the offence against a lawful owner or occupicr,
as described in the complaint, has taken place and
whether it is the accused who has committed it without
any lawful authority. Anyone found committing the
offence described in Section 3 would be amenable to
prosecution under the provisions of _ Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 and no past record of the
accused needs to be gone into by the court.

ML Learned counsel for the respondents stated at the
bar that this a fresh litigation which is pending adjudication
before the Court and even this fact was not denied by the
learned counsel for the petitioners/accused. The pending
adjudication of the civil suit is something else from the
commission of the offence, which was tried within the
purview of sections 3 & 8 of the Illegal Dispossession Act,

2005. Thus, the civil litigations can, in no way, be considered

Sabz. Ali” (D.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
: HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD JAZ KUAN

-12-

as a hurdle for the complainants/ respondents in the matter in
hand. The preamble of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005
explicitly stipulates its object i.c., to protect the lawful
owners and occupiers against illegal or forcible dispossession
from their immovable property and the purpose of the Act is
to provide a forum for quick investigation and trial of the
offence under the Act of 2005. It is the primary duty of the
State and the Courts to protect the right of occupants/ owners
of the property. Likewise, the Act of 2005 does not debar a
person from initiating the proceedings under the Act on the
ground that some of the encroachers or unlawful occupiers in
respect of any portion of the land have initiated some other
legal proceedings either criminal or civil. More-so, any act
which entitles civil liability under civil law as well as
criminal penalty under the criminal law such as the Act of
2005, a person against whom the proceedings were initiated
cannot take a plea that both the remedics cannot be availed at
the same time. It was the duty of the respondents/
complainants to establish that they were occupants of the
property and the petitioners/accused occupied possession
thereof without any lawful authority and dispossessed them
illegally other than due course of law. ‘he description of the
property was mentioned in the complaint and it is an
admitted aspect rather the learned counsel for the petitioners

himself referred to Ex.CW1/5, which was a sketch/map of

Sabz Ali* (DB) HON’ BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD WAZ KHAN

-13-

the property prepared by the learned local commission in
civil suit of 1982. There are two conditions for invoking the
provisions of section 3 of the Act of 2005; firstly, the act of
dispossession, grab, control or occupy without lawful
authority and secondly intention to! dispossess, grab, control
or occupy the property from actual owner. In accordance
with the provisions of section 3 of the Act of 2005 in order to
constitute an offence under this Act, the complainant must
disclose the existence of both i.e., unlawful act (actus reus)
and criminal intent (mens rea). The act of the petitioners by
dispossessing the respondents/ complainants who were
occupants of the property with a categorie stance that on a
particular date, they were illegally dispossessed by the
petitioners has been proved not only through oral but also
through documentary evidence and the order has been
maintained upto the Supreme Court:

12. Jt must be mentioned that learned counsel for the
petitioners lastly argued that for proper determination of the
boundaries of the property a commission may be appointed
in order to put the controversy to rest, once for all. This
argument of learned of learned counsel for the petitioners has
got no relevancy with the matter.in hand, where unlawful
dispossession of the respondents by the petitioners from the
property, which was in their possession on a particular date,

has been proved on the record and that there is no need for

Sabz Ali/* (DB) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MURAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAN 1JAZ KHAN

-14-

determination of the boundaries of the property in the
criminal matters rather the petitioners, at the best, can move
to the Court where civil suit is still pending adjudication to
submit or to request for appointment of a local commission
in order to re-determine the boundaries of the property and
the resolution thereof.

13. For the reasons discussed above, the petitioners of the
instant quashment petition have not been able to point out
any illegality or irregularity in the impugned order passed by
the learned Sessions Judge because the instant petition was
filed by the petitioners on the ground that in deciding
Criminal Revision No.07/10 of 2016, their Miscellaneous
Application No.10/04 of 2016 was decided through
consolidated order but no specific: order was made by the
learned Sessions Judge, however, record reflects that the
learned Sessions Judge in the ordér dated 20.087.2016 has
categorically held that Miscellaneous Application No.4/10 of
2016, in view of the statement of Post Commander Ghafoor
Khan alongwith Moharrir Gul Nabi that the possession of
the property has already been handed over to the
complainants has become infructuous. ‘The petitioners Habib
Ullah and others through their connected W.P. No. 620-M of
2016 were seeking dismissal of the application, by which, the
complainants seeking restoration of the possession. Once, the

learned trial Court has found that commission of offence i.e.,

Sabz Ali/* (D.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMADINAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD 1JAZ KHAN

-~1§-

dispossession of the complainants/ respondents has been
proved then it was rightly ordered that the possession be
restored/ handed over to the complainants, for which, the
respondents/ complainants have submitted the application
and the petitioners want to stay the cxecution proceedings,
however, when the possessiori was given to the
complainants, their petition was dismissed being infructuous,
Thus, their revision petition/ application was rightly turned
down. No case for quashing the order and for setting aside
the impugned order was made out. ‘Iherefore, for the reasons
discussed above, the instant petition and connected W.P
No.620-M/2016 being without merit stand dismissed. No

order as to costs.
