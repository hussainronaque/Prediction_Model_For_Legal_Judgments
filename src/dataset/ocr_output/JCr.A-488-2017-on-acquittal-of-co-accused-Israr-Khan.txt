JUDGMENT

KKK

AHMAD ALI, J. Called in question herein is the
judgment of the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge,
Special Court, Lahor (Swabi) dated 24.05.2012, whereby
the appellant (Israr Khan s/o Sher Muhammad) was
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with fine of
Rs.2,00,000/- in case FIR No.658 dated 30.05.2011, u/s 9-

C CNSA, Police Station, Lahor (Swabi).

2. Brief facts of the case are that on receipt of
information regarding smuggling of a huge quantity of
chars from tribal area to Punjab and Sindh Provinces
through motorway, Muhammad Arif, DSP, Sher Afsar
Khan, SHO, Police Station, Lahor and other Police
Officials of District Swabi, formed a raiding party and

fenced the road at Mera Jalsai, on Peshawar/Islamabad
Motorway. At about 1400 hrs, an oil tanker coming from
Peshawar was stopped and the person who was sitting on
the driver seat disclosed his name as Abdur Raziq
(acquitted accused) while the other person who was sitting
with him on the front seat disclosed his name as Israr
Khan (present appellant). Search of the vehicle led to the
recovery of 2000 kgs chars garda from its secret cavity.
Accused were arrested and a criminal case vide FIR ibid
was registered against them.

3. On completion of investigation, complete challan
against the present accused-appellant as well as acquitted
accused (Abdur Raziq) was submitted in Court, where
they were charge-sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove its
case, produced and examined as many as three witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution’s evidence, statements of
the appellant and acquitted accused (Abdur Raziq), were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied
the prosecution allegations and professed innocence. They
however, declined to be examined on oath or to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellants
as well as acquitted-accused vide judgment dated
24.05.2012, against which only convict Abdur Raziq filed
Cr.A. No.300-P/2012, before this Court, whereas, the

present appellant-convict did not file any appeal. Above
mentioned appeal of Abdur Raziq was allowed by this
Court vide judgment dated 23.11.2016, resultantly, he was
acquitted. Now, the present accused-appellant has also
filed the instant appeal from jail with a considerable
delay, however, not only his liberty is involved but also
his co-accused has already been acquitted by this Court
and findings thereof have attained finality as the
prosecution has not questioned the same before the august
Supreme Court, therefore, the delay in filing of appeal is
hereby condoned.
4. Arguments of learned AAG heard and record of the
case gone through.
5. This Court while re-appraising the prosecution
evidence during hearing of the appeal of Abdur Raziq
(now acquitted), observed and reached the following
conclusion vide judgment dated 23.11.2016:-

“7, The prosecution to prove its case,

examined as many as three witnesses but

PWs-1 & 2, delay in sending the

contraband substance to the FSL and the

statement of accused recorded under

Section 342 Cr.P.C are relevant for the just

decision of the appeal. Munsif Khan, ASI,

PW-1, in his cross-examination, stated that

the SHO, PW-2, in his presence had taken

into his possession 100 plastic bags of

charas weighing 2000 kgs but he did not

say that what was the total quantity of the

contraband substance so separated for

analysis in the FSL, yet Sher Afsar Khan,
SHO, PW-2, in his cross examination,
stated that he had taken into his possession
the contraband substance weighing 4000
kgs. This PW did not remember the exact
time of his departure from the Police
Station. Through he claimed his presence
on the spot at the relevant time, but no
extract from the daily diary showing his
departure from the police Station for duty
has been attached to the case file, so as to
justify his presence on the spot. If the
assertion of PW-1, that “in his presence the
SHO, PW-2 had taken the contraband
substance weighing 2000 kgs” is taken to
be correct, then the narration of PW-2 turns
out to be false and incorrect. Similarly, if
the assertion of PW-2 that “he has taken the
contraband substance weighing 4000 kgs”
is taken to be correct, then the narration of
PW-1 tends to ring false. No doubt, the
contraband substance was recovered on
30.05.2011 but the logic that the samples
prepared for analysis on the same day,
received in the FSL on 02.07.2011 is not
understandable. Even, the delay in sending
has not been plausibly explained by the
prosecution, so as to prove its safe custody,
transmission and handing over of the same
to the chemical Laboratory and thus such
report cannot be taken as plus point to be
relied upon in favour of the Prosecution. In
this state of affairs neither the version of
PW-1 nor the version of PW-2 deserves
implicit reliance, that too, when they
disagree with each other on material
particulars. Apart from the above, the
statement of the appellant recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C viewing that the Excise
and Customs Authorities found a tanker in

an abandoned condition and handed over
the same to the local police. He further
stated that the he along with two others,
being strangers, mere deboarded from
Flying Coach near Jehangira Police Post,
but they were brought to the Police Station
Lahor and later on they were involved in
the instant case. The assertion made in the
statement of the appellant cannot be
ignored altogether simply because the
appellant, according to the FIR, happened
to be a driver, that too, when he
categorically denied the story projected in
the FIR as well as in the statement of the
witnesses produced by the Prosecution.
Though the appellant was intensively
interrogated but nothing was found during
the investigation as could point out to his
involvement in the crime. In the absence of
any corroboratory evidence, it would not be
in accord with the safe administration of
justice to maintain the conviction of the
appellant, especially when it is, all the
more, easy to project such plantation of the
substance in a vehicle. When no such
evidence is available on the record to
connect the appellant with the crime, we
doubt and have reservation about the
genuineness of the recovery as shown in
the Prosecution version. It would be rather
dangerous to rely on this nature of evidence
in a case seems to be projected by the
Prosecution. No evidence is available to the
effect that who took the parcels to the
Laboratory, where and with whom the
same were laying for 33 days and thus the
possibility of tampering with the same,
could not be ruled out. Reliance can be
placed on the judgment rendered in the case

of Fayaz Shah Vs the State (2015 YLR
2189, Peshawar). In the Prosecution case
not only the report submitted by the
Chemical Examiner was legally laconic but
the safe custody of the recovered substance
as well as safe transmission of the
separated samples to the FSL had also not
been established by the Prosecution. It is
not disputed that the Investigating Officer
appearing before the learned trial Court had
failed even to mention the name of the
police official who had taken the samples
to the Laboratory and admittedly no such
police official had been produced before
the learned trial Court to depose about the
safe custody of the samples entrusted to
him for being deposited in the FSL. In this
view of the matter, the Prosecution had not
been able to establish that after the alleged
recovery the substance so recovered was
either kept in safe custody or that the
samples, taken from the recovered
substance, had safely been transmitted to
the Laboratory without the same being
tampered with or replaced while in transit.
The judgment rendered in the case of
Ikramullah and others Vs the State (2015
SCMR 1002) can well be referred in this
behalf.

8. Though, according to the
Prosecution version, the appellant was
driving the tanker while the other co-
accused was sitting with him on the front
seat but no evidence is available on record
to show that they were either owners of the
vehicle or owners of the contraband
substance recovered from its secret places
or that they knew about the concealment of
the contraband in the vehicle, mere passive
presence of the appellant in the tanker is

not enough for his conviction in the
absence of reliable evidence about
transportation of the contraband substance
by him, especially when the Investigation
Agency did not bother to find out the owner
of the tanker or contraband substance
recovered from the vehicle and the Agency
appeared to have acted with ulterior motive
to save the real accused. In the case of
“Zahoor Ahmad Awan and another Vs
the State” (1997 SCMR 543), the Hon’ble

Supreme had also taken the same view.

9. It is also not disputed that
whenever a vehicle is entered to motorway,
a card is handed over to the holder of the
vehicle at Toll Plaza and similarly on its
exit, another receipt showing the duration
spent on motorway, is handed over to the
same person but here it is not the case of
the Prosecution. The Prosecution has failed
to check the concerned Toll Plaza or bring
on record the card given to the vehicle at
entrance point so as to establish the
presence of the tanker on motorway where
the raiding party fenced the road and seized
the vehicle. Such failure on the part of the
Prosecution also reacted against the
reliability of the version narrated in the FIR
as well as in the statement of the PWs.
When this is the quality and quantity of the
evidence, we are afraid; it would not be in
accord with safe administration of justice to
maintain the conviction and _ sentence
recorded by the learned trial Court.
Needless to say that even a single doubt, if
found reasonable, is sufficient to warrant

the acquittal of the accused.

10. For the reasons discussed above,
we have no hesitation to hold that the

charge against the appellant has not been
proved beyond any shadow of reasonable
doubt. We, therefore, allow this criminal
appeal, set aside the convictions and
sentences recorded by the learned trial
Court and acquit the appellant of the
charges levelled against him. He be set free
forthwith, if not required in any other

case.”

6. As stated above, on the same set of evidence, which
has been disbelieved by this Court while hearing appeal
of co-accused vide above mentioned judgment,
conviction of the appellant has been recorded by the
learned trial Court through one and the same judgment,
but the present appellant did not file any appeal. The
judgment/findings of this Court in the judgment (supra)
regarding acquittal of co-accused, who had identical role
as that of the appellant, have not been questioned/assailed
by the prosecution/complainant before the Hon’ble Apex
Court, therefore, has attained finality. Not only an identical
role has been attributed to both the accused, but they were
tried together and convicted and sentenced through one and
the same judgment dated 24.05.2012. In such a situation, the
case of present appellant cannot be treated differently,
particularly, when the impugned judgment has already been
set-aside by this Court in case of co-convict. In case titled,
“Amin Ali and another Vs the State” (2011 SCMR 323), the
august Supreme Court, while accepting appeal of convicts, not
only acquitted them but also acquitted co-convict who had not

preferred appeal, by extending benefit of the same judgment.
7. For the reasons discussed above and placing reliance on
the judgment (supra) of the august Supreme Court, we by
allowing this appeal, set-aside the conviction and sentence of
the appellant (Israr Khan), recorded by the learned trial Court,
vide judgment dated 24.05.2012 and hereby acquit him of
the charge levelled against him. He be set at liberty, forthwith,

if not required to be detained in any other case.

8. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
