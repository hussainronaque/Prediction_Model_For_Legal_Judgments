and to furnish bail bond to the tune of
Rs.1,100,000/- to satisfaction of Probation
Officer. The sentences were directed to run
concurrently with benefit of section 382-B,
Cr.P.c.

2. Brief facts of the case as emerging from
the frst information report are that on 30.03.2019 at
00:20 hours complainant Mst. Salma Bibi (PW-1) in
the company of her brother-in-law Ibrahim (PW-2)
and her minor daughter/ victim Hina Bibi aged 5/6
years came to P.S Khall and made a report to the
effect that on the previous day her minor daughter
named above came back home late at 14:00 hours
from schoo]. She asked her daughter for late coming
in response whereof she started crying and told her
that on her way back to home from school, Saqib
(appellant), who was standing on the way, called her
and took her to his baitak on the pretext of giving
her cash amount purportedly sent by her father from
Saudi Arabia. After taking her to the baitak, the
appellant undressed her as well as himself and
thereafter forcibly raped her. He retained her in the
baitak with a view to console her not to disclose the

event before any one and thereafter let her go home.

Abdus Sattar Khan (PW-13), the then
SHO, recorded report of complainant in shape of

formal FIR (Ex.PA). He also prepared injury sheet

0B: Hon‘ble Mr. lustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, justice Winer Ahmad
-3-

of the minor victim and sent her to hospital for
medical examination. After conducting medical
examination of the minor victim, lady Dr. Muneeza
Hussain (PW-11) gave her opinion Ex.PW-11/1

which is as under:

She was lied compatibly on bed examined from
head to toe fully exposed no signs of force were
found although there was generalized scattered
rashes and all scratches marks were seem on
thigh and legs. The victim was febrile.

Yes sexual intercourse with force has been done
(vaginal plus anal)

No hymen membrane was found on examination.

Signs of.inflammation was observed in perianal
areas and right sided vaginal areas and small tear
was observed in anal area. Three swabs were
taken one dry from anus and one dry from vagina
and wet from vagina and provided to the police
officers and referred to the TMG Hospital Gynae
Cologist for expert opinion.

The lady doctor also gave her report
(Ex.PW-11/2) on the injury sheet, which is as

follows.

According to our examination, her hymen
membrane was seen to be ruptured. Moreover,
right side vagina swelling and bruises were seen
in the anal area. She was sent to Timergara for
bone age that was done by TMG Radiologist i.e
“bone age approximately 6/7 years”.

According to the Timergara District
Gynecologist and that opinion was “Hymen
membrane seems to be torn, positively side are
intact, no active bleeding, tear or bruises on
vagina”.

Conclusion: on examination basis the hymen
membrane does not:look to be intact. So it looks
to. be forceful rape has been done (i.e anal +
vaginal).

3. ‘The appellant was arrested on
30.03.2019. He was produced before Dr. Anwar
Khalid (PW-12) for medical examination. According
to his report, by that time the appellant had
developed secondary sexual characteristics, hence,
he was declared to have attained the age of puberty,
however, for further confirmation he was referred to
radiologist for determination of his bone age who
reported the same as 13/14 years. Since he had
already taken a bath, therefore, no stains could be

found on his pubic area.

4. After completion of usual investigation,

the appellant was challaned to Juvenile Court for his

trial. Formal charge was framed against him to

Tajamul/PS*

which he did not plead guilty by opting to face the
trial. In order to prove its case against the appellant,
prosecution produced thirteen witnesses and closed
the evidence. He was thereafter examined u/s 342,
Cr.P.C but he once again denied the allegations of
prosecution, however, he neither examined himself
on oath nor opted to produce any evidence in his
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court convicted him u/s 376/377 PPC read with

sections 44 & 53 CPA and sentenced him vide

ba: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag tbrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Abmad
-5-
judgment dated 04.12.2019 to undergo seven years

imprisonment.

The appellant challenged his conviction
and senten¢e through Cr.A No. 581-M/2019 which
was accepted by this Court vide judgment dated
27.07.2020 by remanding the case to trial Court with
directions to reframe the charge against the appellant

and proceed with the case further.

During post-remand proceedings,
prosecution relied upon the evidence already
produced during the first round, however, I.O Abdul
Hamid SI (PW-6) was re-examined for placing on
file opinion of expert (Ex.APW-6/2) regarding
trousers of the victim and appellant and swab which
had been sent by I.O for analysis vide application
Ex.PW-6/1 to KMC, Peshawar. After examination of
the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C and hearing the
arguments, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced him vide judgment dated 17.10.2020, the
detail has already been given in the earlier part of
this judgment. Legality of the said judgment has
been challenged through this appeal.

5. “We have heard the arguments and

perused the record.

6. Keeping in view the nature of offences,
prosecution could not be expected to produce any
eye witness of the occurrence, thus, the case against
the present appellant is mainly based on
circumstantial evidence especially medical reports
furnished by lady doctor after medical examination
of the minor victim. The lady doctor (PW-11), after
medically examining the victim, has given her
detailed reports Ex.PW-11/1 and Ex.PW-11/2 which
are explicit in terms and clearly verify that hymen of :
the victim was absent and tear was found on her anal
region, hence, there remains no doubt to conclude
that the victim was subjected to forceful vaginal as
well as anal intercourse. The lady doctor was
thoroughly cross-examined on each and every aspect
of the case but nothing was brought on record to
create a doubt with regard to her observations
regarding the victim she had recorded in her reports.
Thus, medical evidence in the present case is of °
pivotal importance and can rightly be considered
against the appellant. Reliance is placed on the
judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
in the case titled Muhammad Asif and another Vs,
The State (2006 SCMR 338), wherein it was

observed that:

8. We are not persuaded to agree with the
contentions of learned counsel for the
petitioner mainly for the reasons that
petitioners have failed to bring on record
any animosity with the complainant for
their false implication. On the contrary, the
prosecution has brought on record truthful
and believable evidence produced by Abdul
Ghafar victim who categorically implicated
the petitioners with commission of sodomy
forcibly. His statement is corroborated by
the statement of P.W. Muhammad Siddique
to whom he narrated the facts immediately.
His version is also supported by medical
evidence produced by Dr. Muhammad
Saeed Sabri, P.W.2 according to which
there were slight abrasions present between
anus and the tip of coccyx.

A Although prosecution has not examined

the victim apparently because of her tender age,

however, complainant Mst. Salma Bibi (PW-1), her

Tajemuys*|

mother, has lodged the report in her presence on the
basis of information she had received from her
immediately after the occurrence. Complainant and
her brother-in-law Ibrahim (PW-2) have stated that
they had found blood stains on shalwar of the victim
and she was crying because of pain. Both the said
PWs have been significantly cross-examined but they
have remained firm in their narrations with regard to
all the events followed by the occurrence, hence, the
natural mode of their narrations excludes all the
possibilities of concoction or pre-planning for

op: Hon'ble Mr. tustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-8-

enrobing an innocent person in a false case.
Similarly, the appellant was arrested on the same
night from his house and was medically examined by
Dr. Anwar Khalid (PW-12) who has confirmed in his
report Ex.PW-12/1 that the appellant by that time had
developed secondary sexual characteristics and had
attained puberty. The J.O has taken into possession
the cot on pointation of the appellant from his baitak
on which he had subjected the minor to rape. Thus,
the happenings which had occurred after the
occurrence substantiate statement of the victim
before her mother. Moreso, possibility of false
implication of the present appellant in the case on the
basis of ill-will is ruled out for the reason that there is
no evidence of previous enmity between the parties
nor the defence has confronted complainant or her
brother-in-law Ibrahim (PW-2), who had verified the
report, with any suggestion in this regard. Even
otherwise false implication of accused in such like
cases could not be expected from parents of the
victim because of shame and humiliation in society
as obviously as result of such disclosure the victim
would carry the stigma with her for the whole of her

life, therefore, after thrashing out the entire evidence

TojamuyPs* |

DB: Hon’bte Mr. tustice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon‘bte Mr. Justice Wiger Ahmad
-9-
on record, we are satisfied that there is no possibility
of false implication of the appellant in the present
case. Therefore, testimony of PW-1 and PW-2 comes
under the principle of res gestae and the same is
admissible in evidence under Article 19 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Reliance is placed
on the case of ‘Riasat Ali and another Vs. The State’
(PLD 1991 SC 397), wherein it has been held by the

apex Court that:

“\-- Art, 19 --- Admissibility of evidence as res
gestae --- Witness, reported what he had seen of
the occurrence to his father --- Timing and locale
of the occurrence was such that his narration
must have made various links in the same chain
of res gestae --- Such evidence, held was
admissible.”

The complainant (PW-1) and uncle of
the victim namely Ibrahim (PW-2) have explained
all aspects of the occurrence and their statements are
also corroborated by medical and other
circumstantial evidence, as such, their testimony
being straightforward, trustworthy and confidence
inspiring duly connects the appellant with

occurrence.

8. So far objection of learned counsel for
the appellant regarding delay in lodging the report is

concerned, admittedly father of the victim is abroad

Tapamui/ese|

DB: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishttag Ibrahim
Hontbte Me Justicn Wiger Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*

-10-
for his livelihood and complainant was totally
dependent upon her in-laws. Keeping in view nature
of the offence as well as social and domestic issues
connected therewith, reluctance of the complainant,
being a rustic villager, to disclose the matter could
not be ignored. Hence, in the mentioned
circumstances the delay in lodging the report has no

adverse bearing on the case of prosecution.

9. As regards conviction of the appellant
under the Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(the Act), perusal of the impugned judgment would
reveal that besides convicting the appellant under
sections 376 and 377 PPC, the learned trial Court
has also convicted him under sections 53 read with
section 54(2) of the Act which are reproduced below

for ready reference.

53. Sexual abuse. Whoever commits an
offence of sexual abuse shall be punished
with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to fourteen years and shall not be less
than seven years and shall also be liable to
fine which shall not be less than ten hundred
thousand rupees.

The above referred penal provision
mainly speaks about sexual abuse of a child by

another person which has been defined in clause (y)

oa: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag (brahim,
Tojamuyes*|

-ll-
of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Act, which

reads.-

(y) “Sexual abuse” means employing, using,
forcing, persuading, inducing, enticing, or
coercing any child to engage in, or assisting
any other person to engage in fondling,
stroking, caressing, exhibitionism, voyeurism
or any obscene or sexually explicit conduct
or stimulation of such conduct either
independently or in conjunction with other
acts, with or without his consent.

In order to understand the difference
between section 377 PPC and section 53 of the Act,

we deem it appropriate to reproduce section 377

PPC.

377. Unnatural offences. Whoever voluntarily
has carnal intercourse against the order of nature
with any man, woman or animal, shall be
punished with imprisonment for life, or with
imprisonment of either description for a term
which shall not be less than two years nor more
than ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.

Explanation. Penetration is sufficient to
constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the
offence described in this Section.

Perusal of the above penal provisions
under the two laws in light of definition of sexual
abuse clearly shows that sodomy and sexual abuse
are two different offences independent of each other.
In other words, the offence of sodomy does not

contain the ingredients of sexual abuse and vice

versa. The evidence on record though duly proves

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag (brahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wioar Ahmad
Tajarnul/Ps*

-12-

that the appellant has subjected the victim to rape and
sodomy at the same time which are punishable under
sections 376 and 377 of the Pakistan Penal Code but
there is no evidence on record to prove the offence of
sexual abuse of the victim by the present appellant
which is punishable under section 53 of the Act as
well as under section 377-A of the Pakistan Penal
Code. Hence, in absence of any evidence, the learned
trial Court has reached at a wrong conclusion by
convicting the appellant under section 53 read with
section 54(2) of the Act. In this regard we would
refer judgement of this Court dated 25.01.2021 in
Cr.A No. 162-M/2020 titled Usama Vs The State

and another. to

10. Moving on to quantum of sentence
awarded to appellant by learned trial Court, it is an
admitted fact that the appellant is a juvenile offender
of 13/14 years of age and is legally entitled to get the
concessions available to him under the Juvenile
Justice System Act, 2018. Record further shows that
he is first offender and bears no history of his
involvement in such like offences. Moreso, the

parties have patched up the matter through

oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag (brahim
-13-

intervention of the local elders and parents of the
victim have pardoned him in the name of Almighty
Allah. They are present in person before the Court
today and stated that they are no more interested in
prosecution of the appellant in the present case. To
this effect they produced compromise deed dated
26.05.2021, which is placed on file as Ex.PA.
Though ‘the offences are non-compoundable,
however, compromise is in the best interests of both

the parties because by this way the enmity between

- them, which has sprouted because of the present

Tajamul/Ps*

occurrence, could be eliminated, hence, we deem it
just and proper to consider the compromise coupled
with juvenility of the appellant and circumstances of
the case for the purpose of mitigation of the sentence
awarded to him by learned trial Court. Wisdom is
drawn from judgment of the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in the case titled Moinuddin and others

Vs, The State and others (PLD 2019 S.C 749).

il. In light of what has been discussed
above, this appeal is partially allowed, the impugned
judgment is modified by acquitting the appellant of

the charges u/s 53 read with section 54(2) of the Act.

OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrehim:
Taemutest|

-14-

His conviction under sections 376 and 377 PPC is
maintained, however, the sentences of imprisoriment
awarded to him by trial Court under the said heads
are reduced to ten years, the minimum punishment
prescribed under. section 376 PPC. The appellant
was in custody during trial proceedings since the
date of his arrest and has also remained in jail for
about ten months after his first conviction by trial
Court. Being a juvenile, there is apprehension that
his character will get worsened during his long stay
in jail with hardened criminals, therefore, the
appropriate course in the circumstances would be to
release him on probation under section 15(c) read
with clause (a) of the Juvenile Justice System Act,
2018 for the remaining period of sentences of
imprisonment with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C
subject to his furnishing bail bond through his
father/guardian to the tune of Rs.500,000/- to the

satisfaction of trial court concerned. He shall not

commit any offence and shall keep good conduct

during the said period. Violation of conditions of the
bond may result into cancellation of the probation
order on report of the Probation Officer. The

appellant shall report/visit the concerned Probation

Officer once in six months and the Probation Officer
shall submit reports before the trial Court. In case of
violation of the conditions by the appellant, the trial
Court shall intimate Additional Registrar of -this
‘Court in writing by transmitting report of the
Probation Officer whereafter the office shall place
the matter before the Court for further order. Office
is directed to send copy of this judgment to

concerned Probation Officer.
