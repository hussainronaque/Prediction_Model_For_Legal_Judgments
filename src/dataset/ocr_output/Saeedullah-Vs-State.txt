JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, _J.- This

appeal is directed against the judgment dated 27.11.2014,
rendered by learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Charsadda, whereby appellant Saeedullah has been
convicted and sentenced as under:-
Under sections 322 PPC:- To pay Diyat to LRs
of deceased Ashfaq.
Under section 337-G PPC: To _ undergo
imprisonment for 01 year as Tazir and to pay
Daman amounting to Rs.5000/- to injured
Asfandyar.
The appellant shall be kept in jail till
payment of diyat and Daman.
2. The prosecution case is on 24.08.2012
complainant-injured Asfandyar reported to local police in

DHQ hospital Charsadda that on the fateful day he

alongwith Ashfaq deceased while riding on a motorbike

were hit by a flying coach bearing registration No.4175-

LOK, being driven rashly and negligently by the appellant

on Kuladher Mardan road, as a result, they sustained

injuries while their motorcycle was damaged. Later on,

injured Ashfaq succumbed to the injuries, hence, case FIR

No.1090 dated 24.08.2012 was registered against the

appellant under sections 279/322/337-G/427 PPC, in

Police Station Charsadda.

3. On completion of investigation challan was

submitted against the appellant before the learned Trial

Court, where he was tried and ultimately convicted and

sentenced as mentioned above, hence, this appeal.

4. I heard the exhaustive arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and learned AAG for the State.

Record available on file perused with their able assistance.

5. Without dilating upon the merits of the case
in light of the available evidence, lest it may prejudice the
case of either side, I have observed that firstly a wrong
section of law i.e. 322 PPC was inserted in the FIR by the
police and, secondly, the learned Trial Court by not
adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case and the
law on the subject, misled the appellant in his defence by

not confronting him with correct charge. From the

accusations levelled in the FIR it is a clear cut case of
‘qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving’, punishment of
which has been provided under section 320 PPC, but the
appellant has not been charge sheeted under section 320
PPC, rather he has been confronted with the charge of
“Qatl-bis-Sabab” under section 322 PPC. There is
difference between ‘qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent
driving’ and ‘Qatl-bis-Sabab’. Besides, despite that the
appellant has not been charge sheeted separately under
section 337-G PPC but has been convicted and sentenced
under the said section of law thereby causing prejudice to
the appellant in his defence. It is well settled principle of
law that charge against accused shall be specific, fair and
clear in all respects to provide an opportunity to the
accused to defend himself/herself in due course of trial.
The charge shall be clear and by no means, confused to
prejudice the accused. The prime object and the principle
of framing charge shall be to make aware the accused of
the substantive accusations which are to be proved by the
prosecution with clear intention and with unambiguous
description of the offence so as to enable the accused to
defend himself/herself. Section 232 of the Cr.P.C.
empowers the appellate Court that in case it is found that

on account of omissions of particulars in framing charge,

the accused has been prejudiced and has not been provided
an opportunity of clear understanding of the charge to
defend him, it may direct a fresh trial or even quash the
conviction. As per obligatory provisions contained in
S.233 Cr.P.C. for every distinct offence, a separate charge
shall be framed in order to enable the accused to defend the
accusation leveled against him. S.235 Cr.P.C. provides a
proper mechanism for trial of an accused, charged for more
than one offence, but the learned Trial Court while charge-
sheeting the appellant has not adverted to the law on the
subject discussed above.

6. In view of the above, the impugned judgment
of the learned Trial Court being not sustainable in the eye
of law, is hereby set aside and the case is remanded to the
learned Trial Court for trial de novo right from the stage of
formulation of correct charge against the appellant in light
of observations in the judgment. The learned Trial Court
on receipt of the record, after summoning the parties shall
proceed with the trial and conclude the same as early as
possible, but not later than two months, avoiding
unnecessary adjournments except on cogent and plausible
ground, period of which too, shall not exceed four days.
During pendency of the trial, the appellant shall remain on

bail on the already existing bail bonds. Office is directed to

send the record to the learned Trial Court within two days,
without fail.

7. The appeal is disposed of accordingly in light
of the above observations.

8. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court is directed to send copy of this judgment to the
learned Sessions Judge, Charsadda, who shall further
circulate its copy among the Additional Sessions Judges of
the District, with intimation to this court.
