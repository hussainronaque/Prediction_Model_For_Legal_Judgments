JUDGMENT

YOUSUF ALI SAYEED, J.- Through the captioned Applications
under Section 497 Cr. P.C, the Applicant, Khalilullah, son of

Muhammad Sadiq, seeks post arrest bail in respect of two Reports
as to cognizable offences registered on 10.03.2021 on behalf of the
State through ASI Sain Dad (the “ASI”) under Section 154 Cr. P.C
at P.S. Steel Town, being FIR No. 144 of 2021 under Sections 4 & 5
of the Explosives Act read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 (the “ATA”) and FIR No. 145 of 2021 under Section 23(i)(a) of
the Sindh Arms Act (hereinafter collectively referred to as the
“FIRs”), with an unsuccessful attempt to secure bail in that regard
having earlier been made vide like Applications preferred before the
Anti-Terrorism Court No. 5 at Karachi, where the Special Case Nos.

159 and 159-A ensuing from those FIRs are pending.
Concisely, the version of events depicted in the FIRs is that
the Applicant was arrested on 10.03.2021 at 1845 hours from
the entrance Road of Wali Town near Jamia Masjid Ayesha,
Malir by a four-man police party deployed from the
aforementioned PS headed by the ASI, with a henna coloured
hand grenade wrapped in a khaki envelope, enclosed in a
white coloured plastic shopping bag, being recovered from his
right shirt pocket and a 30 bore pistol also being recovered
from his possession, with the grenade bearing No.65-2006 on
its clip while the number of the pistol was rubbed off but the
same apparently bore the inscription “CAL 30 Mauser Made
As China B/M Sharif-PR”.

Learned counsel contended that the Applicant had been
falsely implicated through the FIRs, submitting that he had
been picked up by Rangers personnel well prior to the date of
arrest as shown, and had then been handed over to the police
authorities when it had become apparent that he was not
complicit in any criminal activity, with the police then falsely
shown him as having been arrested in the manner disclosed
in the FIRs on the given date with the grenade and pistol
being foisted on him and Section 7 of the ATA being applied so
as to further do him in. Learned counsel submitted that the
matter merited further inquiry, pending which the Applicant
was entitled to bail, and to reinforce that point he invited
attention to a letter dated 02.12.2020 addressed by the
Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (the
“Commission”) to the Home Department, Sindh, reflecting
that prior to the date of arrest shown in the FIRs, the
Commission was already seized of an application moved by
the Applicant’s father in respect of his disappearance, which

inter alia reads as follows:
“COMMISSION OF INQUIRY ON ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES
DIRECTORATE GENERAL CIVIL DEFENCE BUILDING
(1ST FLOOR) MAUVE AREA, SECTOR G-9/1,

ISLAMABAD.
eA AC aC ak

December 2, 2020

Please find enclosed herewith a copy of Missing
Person application received from Muhammad Sadiq, in
respect of the Missing Person cited in the subject.

2. In order to trace the whereabouts of Khalil Ullah s/o
Muhammad Sadiq, Home Secretary, Sindh, Karachi is
directed to constitute a JIT which may convene its
meeting immediately as provided in the Commission of
Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances Regulations, 2011.
All addressees are directed to initiate measures to locate
the whereabouts of the Missing Person at their end, as
well.”

Conversely, the learned APG opposed the grant of bail,
contending that the Applicant had been apprehended in the
manner reflected in the FIRs, with the pistol and grenade
being recovered from his possession, with the inspection
report issued by the Bomb Disposal Unit following the
examination of the hand grenade on 10.03.2021, reflecting
that the same was functional, being complete with Explosive
Ordnance Devices. However, on query posed, he conceded that
the Applicant had no prior criminal record, and was not

implicated in any case other than those arising from the FIRs.

Having considered the matter, we would consciously refrain at
this stage from embarking on a dissection of the events
narrated in the FIR, lest any observation prejudice the course
of the trial. However, suffice it to say that there is no
allegation of the Applicant resisting arrest or otherwise
attempting to escape the clutches of the police party. That and

the aspect of the Commission ostensibly being activated as to

3
his apparent disappearance prior to the date of arrest shown
in the FIRs coupled with the absence of any prior criminal
record is sufficient in our opinion to bring the matter of his
depicted presence at the scene as well as the recovery shown
to have been made from him within the realm of further
enquiry. As the matter has already been challaned, the
Applicant is no longer required for the purpose of
investigation, and so far as the applicability or otherwise of
Sections 6 and 7 of the ATA is concerned, the same can be
looked into and decided by the trial Court after recording of
evidence. However, at present, we are of the view that under
the given circumstances a case for the grant of bail stands

made out accordingly.

7. It is for that reason that we had made a short order upon
culmination of the hearing on 11.06.2021, whereby we had
allowed the captioned Applications and admitted the Applicant
to bail in respect of the FIRs, subject to furnishing of solvent
surety in the sum of Rs.100,000/- in each case and execution
of a P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the

Nazir of this Court.
