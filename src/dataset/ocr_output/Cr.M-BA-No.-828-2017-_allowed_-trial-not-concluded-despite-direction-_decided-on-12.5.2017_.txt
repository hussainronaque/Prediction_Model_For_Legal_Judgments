WAQAR_AHMAD SETH, _J.- Petitioner, Riaz-ur-

Rehman son of Haji Rehman, having been involved in

case FIR No. 78 dated 3.11.2015 under Section 9(c)

Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 registered at

Police Station ANF, Peshawar, was refused bail by this

Court on 27.1.2017 with direction to the learned trial

Court to conclude trial within forty-five (45) working

days. As trial of accused-petitioner could not be

concluded according to the direction of this Court, the

petitioner applied for bail before the learned trial Court

but the same has been dismissed vide order dated

12.4.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same

purpose.

2. Charge against the petitioner is that he was

found in possession of five (05) Kgs charas.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of the record would reveal that on

3.11.2015, the petitioner was arrested by the ANF

Police having in possession of five (05) Kgs charas.

After arrest, the petitioner applied for bail before the

learned trial Court but the same was dismissed and he

had filed bail application before this Court for the same

purpose. The said bail application was dismissed by

this Court vide order dated 15.2.2016 with direction to

the prosecution to submit complete challan against the

petitioner within a period of fortnight and the learned

trial Court should conclude trial within a period of four

(04) months. The above said directions were not

complied with, hence, the petitioner preferred bail

petition before the learned trial Court but the same was

dismissed and he again filed bail petition before this

Court. This time too, the bail application of the petitioner

was dismissed vide order dated 27.1.2017 with
3-
direction to the learned trial Court to conclude trial
within forty-five (45) working days positively but the
learned trial Court, despite unambiguous directions of
this Court, has not examined a single witness till
9.5.2017 as evident from its order sheet. Had the
learned trial Court been serious and conscious qua
direction of this Court, it could proceed with the trial on
day-to-day basis for compliance of order of this Court in
a letter and spirit but such is not the situation herein.

5. In the case of Jadeed Gul vs. The State
(1998 SCMR 1124), the Hon’ble Apex Court has held
that:-

“S. 497—Penal Code (XLV of 1860),
5.274/275/276/420/48 3/48 2/485/487/467
/468/471---Drugs Act (XXXI of 1976), S.
23/27—Bail, grant of ---Trial of
accused had not been concluded
within two months despite direction of
Supreme Court as Drug Court was not
functioning due to non-availability of
the Presiding Officer---Prosecution
was unable to give time within which
trial was likely to be concluded—Case
of accused did not fall under the
prohibitory clause of S. 497(1), Cr.P.C.
---Accused was admitted to bail in
circumstances”.
-4-

Similarly, in the case of Muhammad Aslam

vs. The State (1999 SCMR 1092), the Hon'ble Apex
Court has held that:-

“S. 497---Penal Cod (XLV of 1860), S.
302/324/148/149—Bail—Despite
direction of High Court trial against
accused had not been completed by
the Trial Court within the specified
period—Prosecution was unable to
give any explanation for  non-
compliance of the said order of High
Court—Petition for leave to appeal
was converted into appeal which was
allowed and the accused’ was
admitted to bail in circumstances”.

Likewise, in the case of Himesh Khan vs.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Lahore
and others (2015 SCMR 1092), the Hon’ble Apex
Court has held that:-

“Speedy trial was the alienable right
of every person, therefore, even if the
provision of S. 497, Cr.P.C. in ordinary
course was not applicable to an
accused person facing charges under
National Accountability Ordinance,
1999, the boarder principle of the
same could be pressed into service in
hardship cases to provide relief to a

deserving accused person
incarcerated in jail for a shockingly
long period”.

6. Petitioner is behind the bars’ since

3.11.2015 and twice directions were issued to the
-5-
learned trial Court to conclude trial but the learned trial
Court, after lapse of more than a year, has examined
only one witness and if the learned trial Court shall
proceed the trial with such a speed, the same would not
conclude in near future, therefore, this Court is left with
no option but to release the accused-petitioner on bail.

7. Accordingly, this bail application is accepted
and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs.
Four lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to

the satisfaction of Judicial Magistrate.

8. Above are the reasons of my short order of
even date.
