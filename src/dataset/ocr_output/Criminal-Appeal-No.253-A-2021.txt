(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
Criminal Trial Court, Abbottabad dated
30.11.2021 in a case registered vide FIR
No.548 dated 18.05.2018 under sections
302/34 PPC, at Police Station Havelian
District Abbottabad, whereby accused Dildar
Khan, Zulfiqar Hussain and Ghulam Mustafa
(respondents No.2 to 4 in connected Criminal
Appeal No.12-A/2022) have been acquitted of
the charges levelled against them, while
accused Muhammad Shafique (appellant
herein) has been convicted under section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment
for life as Ta’zir and also to pay an amount of
Rs.400,000/- under section 544-A Cr.PC to
the legal heirs of the deceased. Benefit of

2. Precisely, the facts of the present case
as per record are that on 18.05.2018 at 19.40
hours, complainant Abdur Rasheed son of
Muhammad Hussain (PW-10) alongwith dead

body of his deceased brother Tanveer Ahmed

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
lodged a report to Cadet Abdul Ghafoor (then)
SHO Police Station Havelian (PW-2) in
Emergency Room TDH Havelian to the effect
that on that day he, on receipt of information
about the occurrence, reached his village from
Abbottabad where he came to know that on
the same day, after offering Assar Namaz, his
brother Tanveer Ahmed alongwith Agqeel
Faisal son of Ali Bahadur, Muhammad Younis
son of Muhammad Yousaf, who are their
close relatives, was proceeding towards his
house; when they reached at a thoroughfare
near the landed property of Muhammad
Yousaf at about 06.00 p.m., in the meanwhile
Dildar son of Mir Alam loudly commanded
his sons namely Zulfiqar, Shafique and
Mustafa to kill them, upon which all his three
sons duly armed with firearms came there and
started firing with the intent to commit their
qatl-e-amd; appellant Shafique with his 30
bore pistol fired at his brother namely Tanveer

Ahmad, which shot hit him on his head as a

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
result of which he fell down and died on the
spot; the occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by Aqeel Faisal and Muhammad
Younis; motive behind the occurrence was
stated to be a dispute over landed property of
PW Ageel Faisal with the accused party. He
charged a father i.e. Dildar Khan (respondents
No.2 in connected Criminal Appeal No.12-
A/2022) and his three sons namely
Muhammad Shafique (appellant herein),
Zulfiqar Hussain and Ghulam Mustafa
(respondents No.3 and 4 in _ connected
Criminal Appeal No.12-A/2022) for
committing qatl-e-amd of his brother Tanveer
Ahmad. His report was recorded in shape of
Murasila (Ex.PA/1) which resulted into
registration of the instant FIR (Ex.PA) and
investigation was started.

3. On registration of the case, a full-
fledged investigation was carried out and then
challan was put in court against the appellant

and respondents No.2 to 4 in connected

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
Criminal Appeal No.12-A/2022. In support of
its case, prosecution produced and examined
as many as sixteen (16) witnesses including
the important statements of PW-2 Cadet
Abdul Ghafoor (then) SHO who is scriber of
the Murasila Ex.PA/1, and who also prepared
the injury-sheet and inquest-report of the
deceased. PW-3 is Dr.Suleiman who
conducted the post mortem examination on
the dead body of the deceased vide post
mortem report Ex.PW3/l. PW-10 is
complainant himself namely Abdur Rasheed
and narrated almost the same facts which were
recorded by him at the time of report Ex.PA/1.
PW-11 is Aqeel Faisal. He being alleged
eyewitness of the occurrence also narrated the
facts regarding the occurrence while trying to
toe PW-10/complainant. PW-12 is
Muhammad Sarwar (then) Sub-Inspector/
Officer Incharge Investigation. He conducted
investigation of the case. When prosecution

closed its evidence, statements of the accused

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C
before the learned trial court, wherein they
claimed innocence, however, they neither
wished to produce the defense evidence nor
desired to be examined as witness under
section 340(2) Cr.PC. Then after hearing
arguments from both the sides, the learned
trial court vide impugned order and judgment
dated 31.11.2021 convicted and sentenced the
appellant while acquitted respondents No.2 to
4 in connected Criminal Appeal No.12-
A/2022, as mentioned in Para No.1 of this
judgment. The appellant has now called in
question the aforesaid order and judgment
through instant criminal appeal and seeks his
acquittal, while complainant Abdur Rasheed
filed connected Criminal Appeal Nol2-
A/2022 against acquittal of respondents No.2
to 4 as well as Criminal Revision No.04-
A/2022 for enhancement of sentence of

respondent No.2 (appellant herein).

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
4. | Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and learned Assistant Advocate
General were heard in detail and record
perused with their able assistance.

5. It is the case of prosecution as reported
by PW-10 Abdur Rasheed to Abdul Ghafoor
(then) SHO (PW-2) to the effect that on
receipt of information about the occurrence,
he rushed and reached to his village from
Abbottabad where he came to know that on
the same day, after offering Assar Namaz, his
brother Tanveer Ahmed alongwith Aqeel
Faisal (PW-11) and PW Muhammad Younis
(abandoned), who were their close relatives
were proceeding towards their house and
when they reached at the time and place of
occurrence, in the meanwhile acquitted
respondent Dildar loudly commanded his
three sons namely Zulfiqar, Shafique and
Mustafa to kill them and in consequence
thereof, all the three accused who were duly

armed with deadly weapons came there and

(Jamil) (D. B. ) Hon "ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
started firing upon them and the fire shot of
appellant Muhammad Shafique with his 30
bore pistol hit his brother on his head as a
result of which he fell down and died on the
spot. The occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by Aqeel Faisal and Muhammad
Younis and the motive behind the occurrence
was stated to be a dispute over the landed
property of PW Ageel Faisal.

6. At the very outset, it was noted that the
very story as set up by PW-10/complainant on
the information conveyed to him by PW-11
Ageel Faisal is highly unreasonable and does
not appeal to sanity as it is the case of
prosecution that all the three nominated
accused were equipped with their respective
deadly weapons and out of them, appellant
Muhammad Shafique was equipped with 30
bore pistol, while acquitted respondents
Mustafa and Zulfiqar were equipped with 12
bore and 222 bore guns respectively and

statedly all the three have simultaneously

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
made firing at them then how the
PW/complainant could say with certainty that
the fire shot of appellant Muhammad Shafique
proved fatal for the deceased who has
undisputedly received a single fire shot on his
skull, therefore, the very prosecution story
does not stand to reason. In the case titled
“Mst.NAZIA ANWAR ys. The STATE and
others” reported as 2018 SCMR 911, the Apex
Court has held that once doubts about the
genuineness of the story lurk into the minds of
the Judges, the only permissible course is to
acquit the accused.

7. It is also an admitted fact and as
transpires from the very contents of the FIR
that the complainant Abdur Rasheed is not an
eyewitness of the occurrence, whereas the said
occurrence has stated to be witnessed by PW-
11 Ageel Faisal and Muhammad Younis,
however, the prosecution has not been able to
prove the presence of Ageel Faisal on the spot,
whereas the other PW Muhammad Younis has

been abandoned by the prosecution being

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
unnecessary. The absence of PW Aqgeel Faisal
at the place of occurrence is floating on the
face of record which is to be dilated upon in
the following paras.

8. It is an admitted fact that PW-11 Aqeel
Faisal is the nephew of deceased Tanveer as
well as of the complainant Abdur Rasheed and
it is also an admitted fact that the instant
occurrence has taken place in village Kasaki
Kalan where at the time of occurrence this PW
Ageel Faisal and PW Muhammad Younis
were allegedly present but soon after the
occurrence, the said Ageel Faisal despite
being the nephew of the deceased did not
bother either to shift the deceased (then
injured) to the hospital or at least to approach
the nearby police post for the report or to the
Police Station for the registration of an FIR
but he instead waited and waited for the
arrival of the complainant Abdur Rasheed and

it was thereafter that the dead body of the

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-ll-

deceased was shifted to the hospital and then
the instant report was lodged therein.

9. It also appears to be highly astonishing,
if not surprising, that if Aqeel Faisal was
present on the spot and he was the direct
eyewitness of the occurrence and when his
real uncle was done to death in his presence
then why he felt shy to be a complainant in the
instant case and instead the report was lodged
through PW-10 Abdur Rasheed who was
admittedly not an eyewitness of this
occurrence, therefore, in the given facts and
circumstances had Aqeel Faisal been present
he would have been the complainant of this
case which also speaks of his absence at the
time and spot of occurrence. In the case titled
“ZAFAR vs The STATE and others” reported
as 2018 SCMR_ 326, the Apex Court has
observed that had they been present at the
relevant time, they would not have waited for

the murder of their father and would have

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
YY

-12-

raised alarm the moment they saw the accused
and his co-accused standing near their father.

10. It is also part of the record that in none
of the initial documents prepared by the local
police, the said PW-11 Ageel Faisal has been
cited as witness. It is an admitted fact that
though the FIR was lodged by PW-10 Abdur
Rasheed, however, even the contents of the
said FIR have not verified by any of the PWs
namely Aqeel Faisal and Muhammad Younis.
Similarly, neither in the injury-sheet nor in the
inquest-report nor in the post mortem report,
the name of Aqeel Faisal is find mentioned
which speaks volume that in fact he was not
accompanying the deceased in the post events
of the occurrence. In the case titled
“Mst.SUGHRA BEGUM __and_ another vs
QAISER PERVEZ and _ others” reported as
2015 SCMR_ 1142, the Honourable Supreme
Court has observed that even in the inquest-
report, prepared at the time of recording the
FIR, the two identifying witnesses shown

were not the purported eyewitnesses. Such

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-13-

glaring omissions cast serious doubts about
the presence of the purported eyewitnesses at
the spot.

11. It is also part of the record and as
transpires from the site plan that PW Aqeel
Faisal was at point No.6 whereas PW
Muhammad Younis was at point No.7 and
both of them alongwith the deceased were
well within the firing zone allegedly made by
the three nominated accused and more
particularly one of them was firing through his
12 bore shotgun but surprisingly none of these
PWs has received a single scratch or a pallet
injury on their body which also falsifies their
presence on the spot. In view of above
discussion, the presence of Aqeel Faisal has
not been established by the prosecution on the
spot, therefore, the evidence of this sole
eyewitness could not be relied upon as it is
settled since long that credibility or otherwise
of the evidence of a witness is to be

considered secondary and first eyewitness has

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-14-

to establish his presence on the spot and if
presence of an eyewitness is not established
then his evidence, if any, would be of no
benefit to prosecution. In the case titled
“SUFYAN NAWAZ and another ys. The
STATE and others” reported as 2020 SCMR
192, the Apex Court set aside conviction and
sentence of appellant Sufyan Nawaz and
acquitted him of the charge framed against him
by observing that complainant is, by all means,

a chance witness and his presence at the spot at

the relevant time is not free from doubt.
Similarly, in another case titled “ABDUL
JABBAR and another vs. The STATE”
reported as 2019 SCMR 129, the Apex Court
has held that it is the settled principle of law
that once a single loophole is observed in a case

presented by the prosecution where presence of

eye-witnesses is not free from doubt, the benefit
of such loophole/lacuna in the prosecution case
automatically goes in favour of an accused. At
the cost of reiteration, it has been observed by

us that, in a case, where the learned appellate

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-15-

court, after reappraisal of entire evidence
available on record, has reached the conclusion
that there is unexplained delay in lodging the

FIR; the presence of eye-witnesses_is not

established; there are irreparable dents in the
case of the prosecution; the recovery is
ineffective and is of no consequence; the ocular
account is belied by the medical evidence; the
motive behind the occurrence is far from being
proved and almost non-existent, the said Court
fell in gross error in maintaining the conviction
of the appellants. In these circumstances and
after an independent evaluation of evidence
available on record, we have no manner of
doubt in our minds that the prosecution has not
been able to prove its case against the appellants
beyond reasonable doubt. In another case titled
“KHALID @ KHALIDI and _two_others vs.
THE STATE” reported as 2012 SCMR 327, the
Apex Court has observed that the ocular
account is not of such a character which
could be relied upon in order to convict a person

on a capital charge when the same is not

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-16-

corroborated by any other independent evidence

as the presence of both the eye-witnesses at

the place and time of occurrence is not

established as their statements have been
disbelieved by the learned appellate court
regarding Sultan Mehmood acquitted accused.
In the case titled “Khawaja AHMAD KHAN
and 2 others vs. THE STATE” reported as
1998 PCr.LJ 1192, this court by allowing an
appeal against conviction has held the ocular
testimony of related, interested and inimical
witnesses has not been supported by any other
independent and unimpeachable source. It was

further held that the presence of the

eye-witnesses is highly doubtful.

12. It is also astonishing that it is the stance
of PW-11 Aqeel Faisal that he shifted his
uncle to the hospital, however, surprisingly
while shifting his uncle in such a critical
injured condition who has received a fatal fire
shot on his head, neither his hands smeared
with blood of the deceased nor his clothes got

stained with his blood as it has never been the

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-17-

case of prosecution that while shifting the
deceased, PW-11 has come across the
aforesaid situation. In the case tilted
“MUHAMMAD NOOR ys. RIAZ SHAH and
another” reported as 2016 MLD 757, this court
has held that in such eventualities had he been
present, damage to him at the hands of
assailant/ assailants was natural. He has not
showed his hands or clothes smeared with the
blood of the deceased because it would be
against a natural human conduct that someone
real cousin will be lying on the spot dead and
he would not even bother to touch him.

13. It is also part of the record that though
the instant occurrence is stated to have been
witnessed by PWs Agqeel Faisal and
Muhammad Younis while PW Aqeel Faisal
was having a direct motive against the accused
party, whereas to this extent PW Muhammad
Younis was comparatively a disinterested
witness as the accused party was not having
any direct motive against him, therefore, he

being a disinterested witness was required to

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-18-

be produced by the prosecution but he was
abandoned being unnecessary and thus in
view of Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984 an adverse inference has to be
drawn that had he been produced in the
witness-box, he would have not supported the
prosecution version. In the case tilted
“MUHAMMAD _ ASIF vs. The STATE”
reported as 2017 SCMR_486 the Honourable
Supreme Court has held that in our considered
opinion these two independent witnesses
could provide the first degree of evidence of
reliable nature, thus, adverse inference has
been drawn that because they were not
supporting the prosecution case so set up,
therefore, they were dropped at the trial. In
this way, the best evidence, independent in
nature, was withheld from the court for
obvious reasons. This fact by itself is
sufficient to discard the evidence of the
interested and related witnesses because their
evidence is not only of the second degree but

also for the reason given above due to their

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-19-

unnatural conduct. In another case tilted

“MUHAMMAD RAFIQUE vs. THE STATE

and others” reported as 2010 SCMR 385 the
Apex Court has held that it is well-settled that
if any party withholds the best piece of
evidence then it can fairly be presumed that
the party had some sinister motive behind it.
The presumption under Article 129(g) of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order can fairly be drawn
that if P.W. Amir Ali would have been
examined, his evidence would have been
unfavourable to the prosecution.

14. In this case it was also noted that on this
case the ocular account is materially
contradicted by the post mortem report. Post
Mortem Report Ex.PW-3/1 would show that
the deceased has received a sole fire shot on his
top skull having its exit on the forehead which
means that he has been fired from an upper
place, however such locale of injury is falsified
by the site plan as well as by the statement of
the Investigation Officer which states that the

house of the appellant is situated in depression

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
il

- 20 -

which means that they were at the lower
level, whereas the deceased was at the upper
level and thus with such physical position,
the bullet should have been travelled from
downward to upward but as per post mortem
report the same is vice versa. In the case
titled “TAJAMAL HUSSAIN SHAH ys The
STATE and another” reported as 2022 SCMR
1567, the Apex Court has held that according
to two witnesses of the ocular account, the
accused while armed with .30 bore pistol
made a straight fire shot on deceased, which
landed on his chest, due to which he fell
down and ultimately succumbed to the
injury. However, this stance was contradicted
by the medical evidence, as according to the
doctor, who conducted postmortem
examination of the deceased, the injury on
the chest, just above the nipple of the
deceased, was an exit wound and the
margins of the wound were black whereas the

entry wound was on the back of the deceased

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-21-

i.e. at thoracic spine. Such major discrepancy
raised serious doubts on the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses of the ocular account.
Prosecution had failed to prove its case
beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt. In
the above-cited case titled “ABDUL JABBAR
and another vs. The STATE” reported as 2019
SCMR 129, the Apex Court has also held that it
is the settled principle of law that once a single
loophole is observed in a case presented by the
prosecution much less glaring conflict in the
ocular account and medical evidence, the
benefit of such loophole/lacuna in the
prosecution case automatically goes in favour of
an accused.

15. It is also part of the record and as
spelling out from the contents of the FIR that
the deceased alongwith two PWs, after
offering Assar Namaz was on his way to his
home, however, the site plan would show that
the deceased was at point No.l and PW-11
Ageel Faisal was at point No.6 and PW

Muhammad Younis was at point No.7 which

(Jamil) (D.B. .) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-22-

places are not on any thoroughfare/path
leading towards the house of complainant
party rather these places are in the lands of
one Yousaf which fact also shows that the
prosecution has suppressed the actual mode
and manner of the occurrence.

16. It is also to be noted that PW-11 Aqeel
Faisal for the first time has stated in his court
statement that the accused party was hiding in
a place, however, such stance has neither been
stated earlier nor the same finds any support
from the site plan. Similarly, PW-11 Aqeel
Faisal has also improved his statement in the
court by stating that after firing, they took
refuge behind a big stone (Parri), however, the
factum of both these places of hiding of the
accused party and of the PWs have neither
been stated in their statements before the [.O.
nor the same are shown in the site plan,
therefore, such aspects of the case goes a long
way that PW-11 has not come with the whole
truth and thus his evidence could not be relied

upon.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-23-

17. As far as recovery of pistol on
pointation of appellant is concerned,
admittedly the same was neither effected at
the time and date of his arrest i.e. 08.06.2018
nor from his direct possession rather it was
effected on the third day of his arrest i.e. on
10.06.2018 and that too after obtaining his
three days police custody by the I.O. Recovery
memo Ex.PW-7/13, vide which the pistol was
allegedly taken into possession reflects that
the recovery proceedings were conducted after
completion of pointation proceedings of the
place of occurrence by the appellant, while
PW-07 constable Jehanzeb (who is also one of
the marginal witnesses to the said recovery
memo) has categorically stated in his cross-
examination that there were many persons of
locality at the time of pointation. He further
stated that I.O did not record statements of
those persons of locality, however, no private
person is visible in the pictures available on

file which fact was also admitted by the

(Jamil) (D. B) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-24-

I.0./PW-12 in his cross-examination. In case
of availability of many local persons, non-
associating them with the recovery
proceedings rather preferring only his
subordinate police officials by the I.O. as
marginal witnesses to the recovery
proceedings, makes the same dubious and
unreliable.

18. Furthermore, recovery sketch Ex.PW-
12/15 of the alleged recovery of pistol also
shows that the house from which the pistol
was recovered is undisputedly a joint house
used for dwelling by other major family
members of the appellant. Though statedly the
room from which the pistol was allegedly
recovered was locked, however, undisputedly
the same was unlocked by father of the
appellant but interestingly neither his father is
shown in recovery sketch Ex.PW-12/15 nor in
photographs alongwith the appellant at the

relevant time.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-25-

19. It is also part of the record and as
admitted by PW-11 Agqeel Faisal in the
opening sentence of his cross-examination that
he is having a direct motive with Dildar (one
of the acquitted respondents) as they are
locked in civil litigations against each other,
therefore, when the main and prime target i.e.
Ageel Faisal was available then why the
appellant/convict opted to spare him and to
kill an innocent person. Had Aqeel Faisal been
present on the spot then due to direct motive
against him, the appellant would have fired at
him but surprisingly he was spared and an
innocent person was done to death. In the case
titled “The STATE through Advocate General

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar vs. ARIF

MOMEN” reported as 2022 MLD 617, this
court has observed that it is astonishing that
why the deceased was chosen as the target,
when the complainant being the prime target
was present on the spot. The complainant,
eyewitness and the deceased were maintaining

a distance of two paces, whereas the

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-26-

respondent has been shown at a distance of 9
paces, with no hindrance in between, so while
lying on the ground, the complainant if
present would have been the easiest target.

20. It is the case of prosecution from the
very inception qua the motive set up in the
First Information Report that they have got
civil litigations with the accused party,
however, on the available record they have not
exhibited any decided or pending proceedings
of the court(s) of law so as to establish the
said motive, therefore, the prosecution has
miserably failed to establish the very motive
behind the occurrence. It is settled law that
prosecution is not bound to set a motive,
however, when once it opted to set a motive
then it has to be proved and in case of its
failure to do so, benefit thereof has to be given
to the accused. In the above cited case titled
“TAJAMAL HUSSAIN SHAH ys The STATE
and_ another” reported as 2022 SCMR_ 1567,
the Honourable Supreme Court has also held
that according to the prosecution the motive of

the occurrence was previous quarrel between

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-27-

co-accused Nazakat Hussain Shah (tried
separately) and Wajid, son of the complainant.
However, the prosecution failed to produce
the said Wajid in order to prove the motive
part, therefore, it can safely be concluded that
prosecution could not prove the motive part of
the story. The Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan in another case titled “SARFRAZ and
another vs The STATE” reported as 2023
SCMR 670, has also held that it is now well
established that if a specific motive has been
alleged by the prosecution then it is duty of
the prosecution to establish the said motive
through cogent and confidence inspiring
evidence. Otherwise, the same would go in
favour of the accused.

21. It is settled since long that for giving
benefit to an accused, it is not essential that
there should be many circumstances creating
doubts, even a single doubt is sufficient to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of criminal
administration of justice that let hundred

guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon "ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-~28 -

person should not be convicted. In the case
titled “SAGHIR AHMAD vs The STATE and
others” reported as 2023 SCMR 241, the Apex
Court has held that it is a well settled principle
of law that for the accused to be afforded the
right of the benefit of the doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating uncertainty and if there
is only one doubt, the benefit of the same must
go to the petitioner. The august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in its judgment rendered in
the case titled “BASHIR MUHAMMAD KHAN
vs The STATE” reported as 2022 SCMR 986,
has held that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable;
trustworthy and reliable evidence. Any doubt
arising in prosecution's case is to be resolved
in favour of the accused and burden of proof is
always on prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable shadow of doubt.

Similarly, in the case titled “KHALID
MEHMOOD alias KHALOO vs The STATE”
reported as 2022 SCMR 1148, the Apex Court
has reiterated the same rational by observing
that in these circumstances, a dent in the
prosecution's case has been created, benefit of
which must be given to the appellant. It is a
settled law that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. In another
case titled “KASHIF ALI alias KALU vs. The
STATE and another” reported as 2022 SCMR
1515, the Apex Court has held that it is settled
law that a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,

trustworthy and reliable evidence. Any doubt

arising in prosecution case is to be resolved in
favour of the accused. Reliance in this behalf
can be made upon the cases Tariq Pervez v.

The State (1995 SCMR 1345), Ghulam Qadir
and 2 others v. The State (2008 SCMR 1221),
Muhammad Akram v. The State (2009 SCMR
230), Muhammad Zaman v. The State (2014

SCMR_749) and Muhammad Mansha v_ The

State” (2018 SCMR 772).

22. In view of the foregoing discussion and
exposition of law, the conviction and sentence
of appellant Muhammad Shafique are not
sustainable in the eye of law, therefore, on
acceptance of this appeal, the impugned
judgment and order of Additional Sessions
Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court,
Abbottabad dated 30.11.2021 to the extent of
appellant Muhammad Shafique is set aside
and he is acquitted of all the charges levelled
against him. He be set free forthwith if not
required in jail in any other case.

23. As far as the case of complainant/
appellant against the acquitted respondents is

concerned as while acquitting the principal

accused Shafique we have disbelieved the
presence of sole eyewitness namely Aqeel
Faisal (PW-11) on the spot at the time of
occurrence and has found that the prosecution
story is doubtful all around, therefore, the
connected Criminal Appeal No.12-A/2022,
titled “Abdur Rasheed vs. The State and
other” too could not succeed as the
complainant/appellant has attributed the role
of ineffective firing upon the deceased to the
acquitted respondents, therefore, the learned
trial court has rightly extended them the
benefit of doubt. Resultantly, the impugned
judgment and order to the extent of the
acquitted respondents namely Dildar Khan,
Zulfiqar Hussain and Ghulam Mustafa is
maintained and upheld and the aforesaid
connected Criminal Appeal No.12-A/2022
being meritless is also dismissed.

24. Since we have allowed the instant
criminal Appeal and set aside judgment and
order of Additional Sessions Judge/Model

Criminal Trial Court, Abbottabad dated

30.11.2021 to the extent of appellant
Muhammad Shafique vide which he was
convicted and sentenced, therefore, the
connected Criminal Revision No.04-A/2022
titled “Abdur Rasheed vs. The State” for
enhancement of his sentence has become
infructuous and the same is accordingly
dismissed.

These are the detailed reasons of our
short orders of even date whereby we allowed
Criminal Appeal No.253-A/2021 _ titled
“Muhammad Shafique vs. The State etc” and
dismissed the connected Criminal Appeal
No.12-A/2022 as well as the connected
Criminal Revision No.04-A/2022 both having

same title ie. “Abdur Rasheed vs The State

and other”.
