JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Through this common
judgment, we, propose to decide the instant writ petition,
filed by petitioner Seyar Zeb and the following connected
writ petitions, as identical question of law is involved

therein. Particulars of the connected writ petitions are as

under:-
1. Writ Petition No.160-P/2017
Arif Mohammad vs The state etc
2. Writ Petition No.161-P/2017
Muhammad Fawad Vs the State etc.
3. Writ Petition No.191-P/2017
Qasim Khan Vs Mian Nasrumminallah etc.
2. In essence, grievance of the petitioners is that FIRs

registered against them under section 3 of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition Interest on Private Loans Act
(Act No.XVI of 2016), (hereinafter to be referred as the
Act of 2016), in Police Station Topi Swabi and Mardan,
being in utter violation of section 6 of the Act of 2016, are
corum non judice, void abinitio and illegal hence liable to
be quashed.

3. Allegations against the petitioners in the impugned
FIRs are that they were found dealing in the illegal
business of advancing loan to the people for the purpose of
receiving high interests, which is an offence punishable
under section 3 of the Act of 2016.

4. Argument of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.

5. The main thrust of the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioners was that the Station House
Officers, were not competent to register the impugned
FIRs of their own because of the bar under section 6 of the
Act of 2016, which provides a proper mechanism for
registration of FIR by the orders/directions of the Justice of
Peace on the application or complainant of any person,
which course has not been adopted, therefore, the
impugned FIRs being nullities in the eyes of law, are liable
to be quashed.

6. The argument of learned counsel for the petitioners
is unpersuasive as section 9 of the Act of 2016, provides
that an offence under this Act shall be cognizable,

non-compoundable and non-bail able. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference section 9 is reproduced
below:-
“S.9 Cognizance of offences:- Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Code
or any other law for the time being in force an
offence under this Act shall be cognizable, non-
compoundable and non-bail able.”
According to section 2 of the Act of 2016, the Code of
Criminal Procedure has been made applicable to the Act.
Under section 2 sub-clause (c ) “Code” has been defined
as under’’-
“Code” means the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898 (Act No.V of 1998)”.
In section 4 under sub-clause (f) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, “cognizable Offence” and “cognizable
case” have been defined as under:-

“ “Cognizable Offence”;

6

‘“Cognizable case”. “Cognizable

Offence” means an offence, for and
oe ‘ bP) ‘
cognizable case” means a case in,
which a_ police-Officer may, in
accordance with the second schedule or
under any law for the time being in
force, arrest without warrant;”.

Keeping in view the mandate of section 9 of the Act of
2016, coupled with the definition of “cognizable offence”,
as provided under the Code, the Station House Officer is

competent to register an FIR under this Act and make
arrest without warrant. Section 6 of the Act of 2016
provides an extra remedy in addition to action under
section 9, in the shape of an application or complaint by an
aggrieved person to the Justice of Peace with regard to
commission of the offence under the Act for registration of
an FIR for the commission of an offence under the Act of
2016. For the sake of convenience and ready reference
section 6 of the Act is reproduced below:-

“S.6 complaint:- A Justice of Peace shall,
within three days on receipt of any application
or complaint with regard to the commission of
an offence under this Act, order the local police
to register a case against such person or group
of person.”

The language of section 6 quoted above is very simple and
unambiguous, which as stated earlier speaks about an extra
relief to an aggrieved person in the shape of filing an
application or complaint. Otherwise, the police on the
commission of offence under this Act, the offence being
cognizable under section 9 of the Act of 2016, have
powers to register FIR and arrest without warrant.

7. So far as the next arguments of learned counsel
with regard to innocence of the petitioners and their false
implication is concerned, the prosecution has leveled
serious allegations against the petitioners, who are
allegedly dealing in the nefarious business of interest, in
contravention of the Act of 2016, which has to be

answered and rebutted by the petitioners before the learned
trial Court through adducing evidence, hence, being a
factual controversy cannot be undertaken in a _ writ
jurisdiction under the constitutional jurisdiction. Moreso,
on commencement of trial, the petitioners have an
alternate and efficacious remedy in the shape of invoking
the provisions of section 249-A or 265-K Cr.P.C, as the
case may be before the learned trial Court, in case the
prosecution evidence is deficient and there is no
probability and possibility of their conviction. In this view
of the matter, the petitioners cannot press into service the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under article 199 of
the Constitution as such jurisdiction can only be invoked
when the aggrieved person has no alternate and efficacious
remedy under the law.

8. For the reasons discussed above, all the petitions
stand dismissed.
