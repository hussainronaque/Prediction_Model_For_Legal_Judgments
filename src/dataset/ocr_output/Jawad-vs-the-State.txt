JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN, _J:-_This criminal appeal under
section 410 Cr.P.C., filed by Jawad, the appellant, is
directed against the judgment dated 26.06.2019, passed by
learned trial Court/ASJ-IH/Modal Criminal Trial Court,
Nowshera, whereby he having been found guilty of
committing murder of Mst. Basraja, has been convicted
under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life and to pay Rs.2,00,000/-, as
compensation to legal heirs of the deceased within the
meaning of section 544-A Cr.P.C., in case FIR No.148
dated 12.04.2017, registered under section 302/114 PPC, at
Police Station Risalpur, District Nowshera.

2. The prosecution case is that on 12.04.2017 at 1955

hours, Mst. Shah Jehana complainant (PW.9), in company
of dead body of her daughter, namely, Mst. Basraja,
reported to police in DHQ hospital Nowshera Kalan to the
effect that on the eventful day she along with her deceased
daughter, son, namely, Shoaib (PW.13) and relative Ubaid
Khan (PW.15), was present in the house, situated in
Mohallah Khattak Risalpur. Appellant Jawad and _ his
father, namely, Muzafar (acquitted co-accused), had come
to her house so as to settle a dispute in respect of her
granddaughter, namely, Mst. Saba Gul. During
conversation/negotiation, there was exchange of hot words
between the accused and complainant party. Muzafar
(acquitted co-accused), commanded his son (appellant) to
kill Mst. Basraja, on which the latter fired at her,
resultantly; she got hit and died at the spot. Motive behind
the occurrence is that some 45 days prior to the occurrence,
Mst. Saba Gul daughter of Mst. Basraja deceased was
abducted by appellant Jawad. In addition to complainant,
the incident is stated to have been witnessed by Shoaib
(PW.13) and Ubaid (PW.15). Her report was incorporated
in the shape of Murasila Exh.PW.4/1 by Gulshan Khan
ASI (PW.4), on the basis of which, FIR mentioned-above,
was registered against the accused. Gulshan Khan ASI
(PW.4), prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased Exh.PW.4/2 and Exh.PW.4/3, respectively, and
shifted her dead body to the mortuary for post mortem

examination. Lady Dr. Bushra Nisar (PW.1), conducted
autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on the same day
at 8.00 p.m. and observed a firearm entry wound circular in
shape 2x2 inches in size, 3 inches above lateral to left ear
with its corresponding exist in front of the right ear.
According to her opinion, the death of the deceased was
instantaneous due to fire arm injury to her brain.

3. Muhammad Alam Khan SI (PW.11) conducted
investigation in the case, he proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of eyewitness.
During spot inspection he secured blood through cotton
Exh.P.1 from place of the deceased and a 30 bore crime
empty from the place of the appellant, vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.11/1. Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.5/1 he took
into possession the last worn bloodstained garments of the
deceased and sent the same to the FSL along with blood
secured from the spot. He also sent the crime empty to the
FSL and placed on file the FSL reports Exh.PK and PK/1,
recorded statements of the PWs u/s 161 Cr.P.C. and on
completion of investigation handed over case file to the
SHO who submitted challan under section 512 Cr.P.C.
against the accused.

4. Akhtar Hussain Khan SI (PW.3), arrested the
accused and placed on file copy of FIR No.107 dated
09.03.2017 under section 365-B/34 PPC Police Station

Risalpur qua abduction of Mst. Saba Gul by the appellant.
5. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted before the learned Trial Court against the
appellant and his co-accused Muzafar, where they were
charge sheeted to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. To prove the guilt of the accused, prosecution
examined as many as fifteen witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statements of the accused were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied
the prosecution allegations and professed their innocence.
They, however, declined to be examined on oath u/s
340 (2) Cr.P.C. and to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court acquitted
co-accused Muzafar, however, convicted and sentenced the
appellant as mentioned above, hence, this appeal. The
prosecution/complainant has not filed any appeal against
acquittal of co-accused Muzaffar.

6. Argument of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.

7. It appears from record that the occurrence in this
case has taken place on 12.04.2017 at 1745 hours, which
has been reported by Mst.Shah Jehana (PW.9) at 1955
hours i.e. after about 02 hours and 10 minutes of the
occurrence. No explanation whatsoever has been furnished
by her in the initial report with regard to the aforesaid
delay. Muhammad Shoaib (PW.13), is the brother-in-law

of the deceased. In cross-examination he has admitted that
one can reach from their village to Nowshera Kalan within
15 minutes in a vehicle or by motorcycle. He deposed that
after the occurrence, the dead body of the deceased
remained on the spot for about 15 minutes, whereafter; it
was shifted to the hospital. If 15 minutes are subtracted
from 2 hours and 10 minutes then the dead body of the
deceased should have been in the hospital at 1830 hours or
at least 1900 hours, but same is not the case herein, rather
the report has been lodged in the hospital at 1955 hours,
which creates serious doubt about presence of the alleged
eyewitnesses at the spot at the time of occurrence. Mst.
Shah Jehana (PW.9) during her cross-examination has
negated her version in the FIR and has totally shattered the
prosecution case as well as her credibility and veracity. She
deposed that she does not remember that who had informed
the police about the occurrence who reach the spot and
shifted the dead body of the deceased to the hospital. She
further deposed that her report was not recorded by the
police at the spot i.e. her house, rather in DHQ hospital.
She disclosed that the police officials while shifting the
dead body of the deceased to the hospital were talking to
her in the vehicle. She further deposed that she does not
remember that who accompanied the dead body to the
hospital as she and the dead body of the deceased were
shifted severally in different vehicles. As stated above, this

part of her statement is complete departure from her earlier
version in the FIR as she has not stated therein a single
word about arrival of the police at the spot and shifting of
the dead body of deceased to the hospital. The other two
purported eyewitnesses, namely, Shoaib (PW.13) and
Ubaid (PW.14), have denied arrival of police at the spot
and shifting of the dead body to the hospital by the police.
In this view of the matter, there are three versions about
shifting of the dead body to the hospital, one furnished by
the complainant in her initial report, second in her court
statement and the third advanced by the scriber of the
Murasila and the purported eyewitnesses Shoaib and
Ubaid. Which of these versions is correct would be best
known to the PWs, however, this create doubt in the
prosecution. In view of the above, we are of the considered
view that complainant Mst. Shah Jehana is not a truthful
witness, hence, the learned trial Court has erred in law
while believing her testimony and relying upon the same
for the purpose of conviction of the appellant in case of
capital charge.

8. Yet there are other circumstances which create
serious doubt to the effect that the occurrence has not taken
place in the mode and manner as alleged by the purported
eyewitnesses. Muhammad Shoaib (PW.13), in
cross-examination, has admitted that his niece Mst. Saba
Gul was abducted by the appellant, on which his brother

Misbah Ullah used to fight with his wife/the deceased. He
admitted it correct that his brother Misbah Ullah was
blaming his wife (deceased) for having hands in the
abduction of his daughter Mst. Saba Gul. Complainant
Mst. Shah Jehana, the grandmother of Mst. Saba Gul, in
cross examination admitted that in the case of abduction of
Mst. Saba Gul, the abductee/her granddaughter has
recorded her statement to the effect that she had not been
abducted rather she left the house with the appellant with
her own free will and contracted marriage with him. She
further admitted that Mst. Saba Gul is now the legally
wedded wife of the appellant, however, she is not on
visiting terms with her family.

9. Whether Mst. Saba Gul was abducted by the
appellant or she eloped with him and contracted marriage
with him is a fact in issue in another case of abduction duly
registered on the report of complainant party, however, it
makes one thing crystal than clear that relations between
the appellant and complainant family were not cordial,
therefore, it does not appeal to a prudent mind that
appellant against whom there was charge of abduction of
daughter of the deceased or he had married her without
consent or will of her family, would himself go to the
house of complainant along with father for settlement of
the said dispute. In a society, particularly, in this part of the
of the Province, in a matter of family honour, the accused

even would never think to sit in front of the victim’s family
what to speak of resolving the matter by himself so much
so in such like matters, the elders of locality think
otherwise, what to say of approaching the victim party for
settlement of the dispute. In this view of the matter, version
of the complainant and purported eyewitnesses that
appellant along with his father had come to their house for
settlement of the matter of Saba Gul, is beyond
comprehensions. A glance over the site plan Exh.PB
depicts that the purported eyewitnesses along with
deceased and the accused have been shown in one room.
Acquitted co-accused aged about 57 years has been shown
empty handed at the spot. The only role given to him is that
of commanding. As per version of the prosecution after the
occurrence both the accused made their escape good from
the spot which also does not appeal to a prudent mind,
because the purported male eyewitnesses, namely, Shoaib
and Ubaid could at least easily apprehend the empty
handed accused, if not the armed one or they could at least
chased the appellant by picking up arms from their house
because usually arms and ammunitions are available/kept
in each house for protection. The conduct of the purported
eyewitnesses like silent spectators further confirms that
they were not present at the spot; therefore, the dead body
was shifted to the hospital after more than two hours of the
occurrence by the local police where a story was cooked.

The purported eyewitnesses have not established their
presence at the spot at the time of occurrence through any
physical strong circumstances of the case, therefore, their
testimony have wrongly been believed and relied upon by
the learned Trial Court.

10. The contradictions and discrepancies in the
prosecution evidence discussed above, are sufficient for
holding that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode
and manner as alleged by the alleged eyewitnesses, rather
in some other mode which the PWs have concealed. The
husband of the deceased has never appeared before the
police or the Court. Similarly, Mst. Saba Gul daughter of
the deceased has also not given any statement. She has not
charged the appellant/her husband for murder of her
mother. She is still residing in the house of the appellant as
his wife. The peculiar facts and circumstances of the case
i.e. annoyance of family members of the deceased on the
elopement Mst. Saba Gul with the appellant coupled with
the fact that husband of the deceased and other male family
member were blaming the deceased in the matter of
elopement of Mst. Saba Gul on the ground that the
deceased was in the knowledge of prior
relationship/contact between the appellant and her daughter
Mst. Saba Gul but she concealed the same, suggests that
the deceased might have been done to death by her family
members but charged the appellant so as to settle their

goals with the appellant.
10

11. The learned trial Court has squarely over looked
the material contradictions and discrepancies in the
prosecution evidence and thereby has arrived at an
erronous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence. The learned trial Court has also erred in law by
convicting the appellant on the same set of evidence which
has been disbelieved to the extent of acquitted co-accused
Muzafar. By now the principle of sifting grain from the
chaff has been done away with and the principle of falsus
in uno and falsus in omnibus has been made applicable in
dispensation of criminal justice by the Hon’ble Supreme

Court in its authoritative judgment dated 04.03.2019,

rendered in Crl. Misc.AppIn.No.200 of 2019 in Crl. A

No.238-L _ of 2013, reported _as (PLJ_ 2019 SC (Cr.C.)

265. In the judgment (supra) the principle of rule of “falsus
in uno, falsus in omnibus” and “shifting grain from the
chaff’ was the main point for consideration. After
exhaustive discussion, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held
that rule falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus shall henceforth
be an integral part of the jurisprudence in criminal cases
and the same shall be given effect to, followed and applied
by all the courts in the country in its letter and spirit. The
relevant part of the judgment is reproduced below:-

“We may observe in the end that a judicial system
which permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to
fail and a society which tolerate it is destined to

self-destruct. Truth is the foundation of justice and
11

Justice is the core and bedrock of a civilized society
and thus, any compromise on truth amounts to a
compromise on a society's future as a just, fair and
civilized society. Our judicial system has suffered a
lot as a consequence of the above mentioned
permissible deviation from the truth and it is about
time that such a colossal wrong may be rectified in
all earnestness. Therefore, in light of the discussion
made above, we declare that the rule falsus in uno,
falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be an integral
part of our jurisprudence in criminal cases and the
same shall be given effect to, followed and applied
by all the courts in the country in its letter and
spirit. It is also directed that a witness found by a
court to have resorted to a deliberate falsehood on
a material aspect shall, without any latitude,
invariably be proceeded against for committing
perjury.”
Copy of the judgment (supra) has been sent to the

Registrars of all the High Courts in the country with a
direction to provide a copy of the same to every judge and
Magistrate within the jurisdiction of each High Court
handling criminal cases at all levels for their information
and guidance. The judgment impugned in the instant
appeal has been passed on 26.06.2019, i.e. after judgment
(supra) of the Hon’ble apex Court, therefore, following the
principle of sifting grain from the chaff i.e. acquitting one
accused and convicting the appellant on the same set of
evidence would be a complete departure from the principle
of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. The prosecution has not
filed any appeal against acquittal of co-accused as such his

acquittal has attained finality which means that the findings
12

of learned trial Court disbelieving the same set of evidence
to the extent of acquitted co-accused are still intact. This
aspect of the case would advance the case of the appellant.
Besides, as stated above, the prosecution evidence is
pregnant with doubts and according to golden principle of
benefit of doubt; one substantial doubt would be enough
for acquittal of the accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is
essentially a rule of prudence, which cannot be ignored
while dispensing justice in accordance with law.
Conviction must be based on unimpeachable evidence and
certainty of guilt and any doubt arising in the prosecution
case, must be resolved in favour of the accused. The said
rule is based on the quote “it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be
convicted” which occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic
Law and is enforced strictly in view of the saying of the
Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in
releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in punishing
an innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be derived
from the judgments of the apex court in case titled,
”Muhammad Khan and another Vs the State” (1999
SCMR 1220) and case titled, “Muhammad Ikram Vs
the State” (2009 SCMR 230).

12. For what has been discussed above, we allow this
appeal, set-aside the conviction of the appellant recorded

by the learned trial Court vide judgment dated 26.06.2019
13

and hereby acquit him of the charge. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not confined in any other case.
13. These are the reasons of our short order of even
date, which is reproduced below:-
For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set aside the conviction and
sentence of the appellant Jawad recorded by
the learned trial Court/ASJ-II/MCTC,
Nowshera under section 302 (b) PPC vide
judgment dated 26.06.2019, in case FIR
No.148 dated 12.04.2017, registered under
sections 302/114 PPC at Police Station
Risalpur, Nowshera and hereby acquit him
of the charge leveled against him in the cited
case. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not
confined in any other case.
