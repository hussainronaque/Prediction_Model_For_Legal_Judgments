Shah Mehmood
Versus

The State
JUDGMENT
For Petitioner: Relative of the petitioner.

For respondents: Mr. Shahid Hameed Qureshi, Addl: A.G.

Date of hearing 15.01.2020

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through the instant petition,
the petitioner Shah Mehmood seeks his release on bail in case
FIR No.503 dated 25.1 1.2019 registered under section 9(d) of
KP CNS Act, 2019 read with section 216 PPC at police station
Pezu, District Lakki Marwat. Earlier, he was refused bail by
learned Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat vide order dated
29.11.2019. It is pertinent to mention that initially the petitioner
had filed bail application before this Court which was converted
into writ petition vide orders dated 10.01.2020, as the provisions
of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 have been made
applicable only to trials and appeals before a Special Court

under KP CNS Act, 2019.

2. The prosecution story as mentioned in the FIR, in
brief, is that on 25.11.2019, the complainant Zaheer Khan SHO
received spy information that Proclaimed Offender Akhtar

Amin charged in case FIR No.187 registered at police station
-2-

Pezu under section 302/324/34 PPC alongwith Shah Mehmood,
accused of case FIR No.474 dated 04.11.2019 of police station
Pezu, who is cousin of the Proclaimed Offender, was present
near the house of Shah Mehmood and were having chars in their
possession. On this information, the complainant alongwith
police contingent rushed to the spot and conducted raid upon the
house of Shah Mehmood. In the courtyard of the house, a
person having shopper in his right hand was found who on
seeing the police tried to run away but was overpowered and the
shopper containing chars weighing 1015 grams was taken from
his hand. On inquiry, the person disclosed his name as Shah

Mehmood.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner is not
available due to strike announced by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar
Council. However, arguments of learned Addl: A.G heard and

record perused.

4. Without going deep into merits of the case lest it
may prejudice the case of either party, suffice it to say that vide
memo dated 25.11.2019, five grams chars was separated for
chemical analysis but neither any copy of application for
sending the sample to F.S.L is available on record nor there is
any report of the F.S.L which could show that the contraband
allegedly recovered from the petitioner was in fact chars.

Reliance in this respect is placed on the cases of Zahid Sultan.

Vs. The State (2019 YLR 2798), Shehzad Khezar Hayat. Vs.
-3-

The State (2014 YLR 849) and Faisal Munir. Vs. The State
through Latif Khan ASI Choki Mayar (2013 P.Cr.L.J 1525).
In the case of Shehzad Khezar Hayat. Vs. The state (2014 YLR

849) it was held that:-

“Without dilating upon the merits of the
prosecution case or the plea of defence,
suffice it to say that the alleged recovery of
contraband charas has been made on
28.3.2013 and the samples separated from it
for analysis were sent to the FSL on the
same day but perusal of the record would
show that no report of FSL is available on
the file, but the FSL report regarding the
vehicle in question is available on record.
Non-availability of FSL report in respect of
the contraband charas allegedly recovered
makes the case of the accused-petitioner
arguable for the purpose of bail because
there is no proof whether the contraband
was charas or otherwise.”

Moreover, the powers of seizure and arrest in public places have
been conferred upon an authorized officer and authorized
officer has been defined by the Act as (i) an officer of the
Directorate General, not below the rank of Sub-Inspector,
authorized by the Director, or (ii) a Police officer/official not
below the rank of Sub-Inspector, authorized by the Regional
Police Officer. Whether the SHO police station Pezu was duly
authorized by the Regional police officer in this behalf or not is
a question to be determined at the trial. Furthermore,
Investigation in the case is complete inasmuch as complete
challan has been drafted and ready to be put in Court and the
petitioner is no more required by the local police for further

investigation. Reliance is placed on the cases of Fagir Hussain
-4.

alias Bali. Vs, The State (2014 SCMR 1502) and Fazal Ellahi.
Vs. The State (2004 SCMR 235). In the case of Fazal Ellahi.
Vs. The State (2004 SCMR 235) it was held that:-
‘It is informed that petitioners are in
custody since 12" February, 2002 and after
completion of investigation they have been
challaned in the Court of Judicial
Magistrate/Senior Civil Judge, Attock and
are no more required to the investigating
agency.
In above view of the matter, we are of
the opinion that after completion of
investigation, even if petitioners are kept in
custody, it will serve no purpose.”
Placing reliance on the above dicta, the tentative assessment of

the available record makes the case of petitioner one of further

inquiry entitling him to the concession of bail.

5. For the reasons mentioned above, this petition is
allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail on furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lac) with two
sureties, each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

6. Above are the detailed reasons for our short order of
even date.
