ALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Accused/petitioner,

Saleem Khan, is seeking post arrest bail in case
vide FIR No.288 dated 07.07.2015 under Sections
365/316/34 PPC Police Station Khan Pur, District
Haripur, which was lodged on the report of Wahid
Gul, complainant/respondent No.2, who reported
to the police in the Emergency Ward of DHQ
Hospital Haripur at 1150 hours on 05.07.2015 that
earlier in the day at 9.30 AM he was present on
duty in Glo Bandi when he received information

about his wife Mst Mashrana Bibi and daughter
Mst Ayesha Wahid taken to a Private Hosptial in
injured condition whereupon he reached Mang
Private Hospital where he was told by his wife and
daughter that they were coming to Civil Hospital
Akhra from Koli Nara for treatment in Suzuki
No.396/KH and when at 9.30 AM they knocked at
the rear window glass of the Suzuki at Akhra stop,
driver of the Suzuki accelerated speed of the
Suzuki instead of stopping the same, forcing both
his wife and dauaghter to jump out of the Suzuki
out of fear and the Suzuki driver made good his
escape from the spot in the Suzuki. The number of
Suzuki was noted by some one present there, who
also witnessed the occurrence and brought his
wife and daughter in injured condition to private
Hospital Mang for treatment by Dr. Ihtisham and
informed him on mobile phone. The injured were
shifted to Civil Hospital Haripur after first aid
treatment in the private hospital.

2. The injured, Mashrana Bibi, wife of the
complainant, had sustained head injury in the

incident and succumbed to the injuries sustained
by her on her way from DHQ Hospital Haripur to
ATH Abbottabad, while the other injured Ayesha
Wahid, survived injury on her left arm. In her
statement under Section 164 Cr.PC, recorded on
07.07.2015, Mst Ayesha Wahid charged driver of
Suzuki No.398/KH for the offences. The
accused/petitioner and co-accused Abdul Waheed
secured ad-interim pre-arrest bail on 13.07.2015
and 08.07.2015, respectively and were formally
arrested in the case; but the ad-interim pre-arrest
bail granted to both the accused/petitioner and co-
accused were recalled/cancelled by the learned
ASJ-III. Haripur, vide order dated 18.08.2015.
The suzuki bearing No.396/KH was handedover to
the police by its owner Haji Khan Afsar and the
accused/petitioner also handed over his driving
liecnese to the police. The accused/petitoner and
co-accused Abdul Waheed made pointation of the
secne of the occurrence to the police. The
accused/petitioner and co-accused Abdul Waheed
moved the forums below for post arrest bail, but

bail was declined to the accused/petitioner; while
co-accused Abdul Waheed succeeded in securing
bail from the Court of learned ASJ-III, Haripur,
vide order dated 05.09.2015. After completion of
investigation, complete challan has been submitted
in the case on 09.09.2015.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner, learned Assistant Advocate
General assisted by learned Counsel for the
complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and record
perused.

4. It may be observed at the very outset that
non charging of the accused/petitioner in the FIR
by the complainant would not be fatal for the case
of prosecution at this stage, keeping in view facts
and circumstances of the case, rather non charging
of the accused/petitioner in the instantly lodged
report would rule out the possibility of false
implication of the accused/petitioner with
malafide intention. Besides, the role of the
accused/petitioner is quite distinquishable from
co-accused Abdul Waheed, already admitted to

bail by the learned ASJ-II, Haripur, as the latter
had been charged only for occupying the front seat
along with the accused/petitioner at the time of
occurrence, having no active role in the
commission of the offence, whereas the
accused/petitioner is charged for the heinous act of
speeding up the Suzuki when he was asked to stop
the same, thereby forcing both the deceased and
injured to jump out of the Suzuki while
apprehending threat to their honour, resulting in
injury to Mst Ayesha Wahid and also fatal head
injury to Mst Mashrama Bibi, leading to her death.
The presence of the accused/petitioner on the
wheels at the time of occurrence has been
established during investigation through
statements of eye witnesses from the general
public who were statedly present on the spot at the
time of occurrence and also through the statement
under Section 161 Cr.PC of owner of the Suzuki
namely Haji Malik Afsar.

5. In short, the material available on record,
including ocular and circumstantial evidence,

prima facie connect the accused/petitioner with the
offence falling in the prohibitory clause of section
497 Cr.PC, thus disentitling him to the concession
of bail. Therefore, the bail petition is dismissed.
