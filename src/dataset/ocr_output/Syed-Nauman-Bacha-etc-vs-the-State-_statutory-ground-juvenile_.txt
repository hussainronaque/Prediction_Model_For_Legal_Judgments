ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- Petitioners Syed Nauman
Bacha and Syed Luqman Bacha, who have been declined
bail on merit up to this Court, through this application,
seek their release on bail on statutory ground in case FIR
No.191 dated 15.05.2014, registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC, in Police Station Par Hoti, District
Mardan, in terms of section 10(7) of the Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance, 2000 (hereinafter to be referred as the
Ordinance).
3. Having heard the arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, it appears from the FIR that petitioners along
with co-accused Parvez, are charged for committing the

murder of deceased Khalid Bacha and an attempt to
commit the murder of complainant. The question of
juvenility of the petitioners has already been dealt with
by the learned trial Court, wherein the petitioners have
been declared as Juveniles, hence, are being tried under
the Ordinance.

4. I, would straight away refer to section 10 (7) of
the Ordinance, which read as under:-

â€œ10 (7) Notwithstanding anything contained
in the Code and except where a Juvenile
Court is of the opinion that the delay in the
trial of the accused has been occasioned by
an act or omission of the accused or any
other person acting on his behalf or in
exercise of any right or privilege under any
law for the time being in force, a child who,
for commission of an offence, has been
detailed shall be released on bail,--

(a) If, being accused of an_ offence
punishable with death has been detained
for such an offence for a continuous
period exceeding one year and whose
trial forsuch an offence has not been
concluded.

(b) If, being accused of any offence
punishable for imprisonment for
imprisonment for life has been detained
for such an offence for a continuous period
exceeding six months and whose trial for
such offence has not concluded, or

5. Before determining the entitlement of the
petitioners for bail on statutory ground, I, would like to
meet the legal point raised by learned counsel for the
petitioners that since under section 12 (a) of the Ordinance,

a death sentence shall not be awarded to the petitioners
being juveniles, therefore, the statutory period for the
purpose of bail would be six months as provided under
section 10 (7) (b) of the Ordinance, referred above, which
the petitioners have completed more than four times.

6. This Court is in agreement with the learned
counsel for the petitioners but only to the extent that as per
mandate of section 12 of the Ordinance, a death penalty to
a juvenile shall not be awarded, however, disagrees with
his contention that the statutory period in such
circumstances would be six months. Section 10 (7) of the
Ordinance, provides the statutory period as 01 years in case
a juvenile is charged with an offence punishable with death
and six months if charged with an offence punishable life
imprisonment. No doubt, the petitioners being juveniles as
per mandate of section 12 of the Ordinance cannot be
awarded death penalty, but they being charged for an
offence punishable with death, the statutory period
provided under section 10 (7) (a) of the Ordinance, shall be
taken into consideration which is one year. Had it been so
as pointed out and interpreted by learned counsel, the
Legislature keeping in mind the mandate of section 12 of
the Ordinance, would not have enacted sub-clause (a) of
sub-section (7) of Section 10 of the Ordinance.

7. It appears from the record that petitioners are
behind the bars since their arrest on 10.12.2015 till date i.e.

a period of more than two years. Challan against them has
been submitted on 15.07.2016 i.e. after a period of more
than seven months, followed by framing of charge on
10.08.2010. Though, major portion of the prosecution
evidence has been recorded so far, but still material
evidence i.e. the statements of eyewitnesses and the I.O.
are yet to be recorded, which would cause further delay
keeping in view the lethargic conduct of the prosecution.
On perusal of order sheets of the learned trial Court, I
observed that non-appearance of the prosecution witnesses
on majority occasions has caused delay in conclusion of
trial hence, the petitioners are entitled to the concession of
bail on statutory ground of delay of more than one year.

8. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees three lac with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
