WIQAR AHMAD, J.- This judgment is directed
to dispose of the appeal filed by appellants
namely Raham Bacha and Saleem Khan against
judgment of their conviction and sentences dated
15.10.2018 of the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III Swat, whereby they have been
sentenced as follows;

U/S 302 (b) PPC to life imprisonment as Ta’zir
along with payment of compensation of
Rs. 500,000/- (five hundred thousand) each
under section 544-A Cr.P.C, payable to legal
heirs of the deceased. The amount of

Srom both appellants as arears of land revenue,

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice tshtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad ™
U/S 324 PPC to five years rigorous
imprisonment.

Both the appellants were however extended the
benefit of 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Appellants along with other co-
accused faced trial in case FIR No. 160 (Ex. PA)
dated 23.08.2016 registered under sections 302,
324, 147,148,149 PPC at police station Shamozai
District Swat on the basis of ‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-
3/L) sent by Akhtar Ali Khan, SHO (PW-3). The
FIR has been registered on the report of Saleem
Khan (one of the appellant herein) wherein he
stated that his sister-in-law (<1) namely Mst.
Shakila wife of Sultanat Khan had left the house
moments before the occurrence, by saying that
she had been going to house of” one
Ali Rehman for purchasing new clothes. She got
late, the complainant was therefore searching her
in the nearby houses. When he reached the
drawing room (Si:) of his uncle Jehan Bakht
Badshah he found a stranger in said drawing
room along with her. He locked the drawing
room from outside and called father of the lady

namely Raham Bacha (the other appellant). They

then opened door of the room, pulled them

NAWAB. (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtiaq lorahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
with a rope and started hitting both of them with -
stones causing them numerous _ injuries,
whereafter people of the locality came and took
them to the hospital. Complainant had then been
unaware whether the injured had been alive or
dead. The occurrence was stated to have been the
result of rage and fury that was stirred in the
mind of complainant when he found the lady in —
company of a stranger inside the drawing room.
The report was also endorsed by Raham Bacha,
the other appellant by affixing his thumb
impression thereon.

3. Appellants were arrested on
23.08.2016 and on their pointation the
Investigating Officer recovered blood stained
rope (~4), blood stained stone and three pieces of
marbles (Ex.P-3) vide recovery memo Ex. PW-
6/1 dated 23.08.2016. Blood stained earth was
also taken in possession from the spot (Ex.P-4)
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-6/2 dated
23.08.2016. On completion of investigation in the
case, complete challan was put in Court. Charge
was framed against accused/appellants and other

co-accused on 20.12.2016, whereafter prosecution

NAWAB (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
was invited to produce evidence. Prosecution
examined thirteen (13) witnesses and closed its
evidence, Statements of the accused were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C. On conclusion of
proceedings in trial, both the accused/appellants
were convicted for commission of the offences vide
judgment dated 15.10.2018 of the Court of learned
Additional Sessions-II] Swat as stated earlier, while
the co-accused namely Jehan Bakht Bacha and
Akbar Ali were acquitted of the charges by
extending them benefit of the doubt. The
absconding co-accused namely Anwar Bacha was
however declared proclaimed offender.
Accused/appellants challenged their
conviction and sentences through the instant
appeal before this Court.
4. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, learned Astt:
A.G appearing on behalf of State and perused
the record.
5. Perusal of record reveals that
prosecution have mainly been relying upon
statement of the then complainant now appellant

namely Saleem Khan contained in the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
‘Murasila’ (Ex.PW-3/1) as well as its
endorsement by the other appellant namely
Raham Bacha. Besides, there has also been a
statement of the hostile witness namely Mst.
Shakila recorded as PW-1.

6. So far as statement of the lady
namely Mst. Shakila is concerned, she has
resiled from her earlier statement recorded
under section 164 Cr.P.C on 25.08.2016. She
had mainly shifted the blame of commission of
the offence to absconding accused i.e. her
brother namely Anwar Bacha in her statement
recorded before the Court. She had though been
declared a hostile witness and allowed to be
cross-examined but nothing beneficial to the
case of prosecution could be extracted from her
mouth. Even if testimony of this witness is
considered, same would make case of
prosecution a case of two versions lying poles
apart from each other. Both the versions,
emerging from prosecution evidence itself,
would be difficult to be reconciled together. In
this respect, reliance is placed on judgment of
Hon’ble Federal Shariat Court in the case of

NAWAB {D.B} Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
“Nadeem and others v/s The State and others”
reported as 2014 P Cr. LJ 374 wherein it has
been held;

“Thus it is clear from the above that there are two
versions made by the P.Ws. themselves and both
these versions are self-contradictory. Obviously two
contradictory statements about the same occurrence
cannot be considered truthful. Therefore, a genuine
doubt has arisen about these P.Ws., who blew hot
and cold in the same breath and showed least respect
for telling the truth and, by being capable of
changing their versions as and when it suited them,
proved that they are worthy of no credence even if
they are natural witnesses of the occurrence. If a
witness deposes falsely under threat and that too on
oath inside a court, on one occasion, how can he or
she be relied upon and believed as truthful on
another occasion. This mercurial behavior reflected
from their conflicting depositions lends, in a way,
support to the defence plea that Inayat complainant
and Mst. Fouzia who had been residing at
Agriculture Farm of Arif Badrana for the last so
many: years had implicated all the accused at his
instance.” ;

7. Mainstay of the case of
prosecution has been report lodged by
complainant namely Saleem Khan as well as its
endorsement by co-appellant namely Raham
Bacha. When appellant namely Saleem Khan
was confronted with his statement recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C, in question No. 3 he

replied;

When scribe (appellants herein) of
the report has resiled from their statements then
same cannot be solely based upon to convict
them for commission of an offence carrying a
capital punishment. Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India while dealing with a somewhat similar
situation, had held that first information report
of the occurrence was not a substantive piece of
evidence and could not be used to corroborate
the statement of maker under section 157 of the
Evidence Act. Relevant part of observations of
the august Court in the case of Nasar_Ali_vs.
The State of Uttar Pradesh reported as AIR
1957 _S.C_366, are reproduced hereunder for
ready reference;

“A First Information Report is not a
substantive piece of evidence and can
only be used to corroborate the
Statement of the maker under s.
157 of the Evidence Act or to
contradict it under s. 145 of that Act.
It cannot be used as evidence against
the maker at the trial if he himself
becomes an accused, nor to
corroborate or contradict other
witnesses. In this case, therefore, it is
not evidence.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Saleh vs.

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
The State reported as PLD 1965 Supreme
Court 366, has also held;

“Muhammad Saleh himself went to
the Police Station to report the matter.
What he said was recorded at 11:30
am, on the 26th February. That
statement was inadmissible evidence
on account of its inculpatory nature.”

This Court in its earlier judgment

given in the case of Muhammadullah and

another_vs. The State through Additional

Adyocate_General_and another reported as
2018 P Cr. L_ J 1633, has also held in this
respect;

“First Information Report basically
covers the information regarding a
cognizable offence given to officer
incharge of a police station the
purpose of which is to set the law in
motion for conducting investigation
in the case. It is not a substantive
piece of evidence unless the maker
himself deposes in Court to confirm
the contents of the FIR entered
therein at his behest. Keeping in view
the above status of the FIR, this
document by itself cannot advance the
prosecution case except it is recorded
by a person who is near to die which
is commonly known as dying
declaration but that is also admissible
in evidence under certain principles
laid down by superior Courts.”

Learned counsel representing
respondent No. 2 (complainant) have relied

upon judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’bte Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad

Pakistan in the case of “Muhammad Khan v/s

Dost Muhammad and_17 others” reported as

PLD 1975 Supreme Court_607 where the
august Supreme Court, while dealing with
evidentiary value of a cross report had observed;

Mr. Ijaz Hussain Batalvi next objected to the
reliance by the trial Court, on, what was
treated as F. I. R. Exh. P. F F F in the
counter-case recorded at the instance of Dost
Muhammad respondent. The objection was
twofold firstly, the maker of the statement
having disowned that statement. it could, at
best, be regarded as his statement recorded
under section 162, Cr. P. C. during the
investigation of the instant case. In support of
thin limb of his argument, learned counsel
cited Privy Council case in Pakala Narayana
Swami v. Emperor (A I R 1939 P C 47).
Secondly, it was urged that, if at all, the
statement is admissible, it must be accepted as
a whole or not at all and in any event against
the maker only and not against other
respondents. It is true that the trial Judge
relied on Exh. P. F F F as piece of
confirmatory evidence in general support of
the prosecution case against all the accused.
The High Court however, did not treat Exh. P.
F F Fas "substantive evidence" and observed
that even otherwise, "it had to be considered
in it: entirety" and not the portion which
supported the prosecution version.
Nevertheless, as pointed out earlier, the High
Court found that quite apart from Exh. P. F F
F, other evidence on record showed that from
among the seventeen accused, respondents I
to 7 were guilty of rioting and curtain other
offences, which in the opinion of the High
Court, they had committed in the course of the
incident, viz, offences under sections 304,
Part 1, 307 and 436 rear with 149, h. P. C.
This appeal being against the judgment of the
High Court and not that of the trial Court, the
objection raised by the learned counsel is
hardly tenable.

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-ll-

On the merits of the objection, the first limb of
the argument is without substance. The Privy
Council case proceeded on entirely different
facts. It was not a case of an F. I. R. being
registered in the cross-case. The short
question, which in so far as it is relevant to
this case, was whether the statement made
before the Police, during the investigation of a
case, by a person who had not till then joined
the investigation as accused, can subsequently
be proved by the prosecution against him as
his admission, in the same case. The
prosecution in that case sought to prove an
admission by the accused on the plea that the
expression, "the person" in section 162, Cr. P.
C. refers to a person, other than an accused or
a potential accused and that therefore any
admission (as distinguished from downright
confession of guilt) made by an accused or a
potential accused is provable against him. The
argument was rejected, and their Lordships
came to the conclusion that such "statement is
not admissible even when made by the person
ultimately accuser". Rather the matter is
directly covered by this Court's Judgment in
Ali Zaman v. The State (P L D 1963 S C 152),
in which the initial report made by the
accused as complainant in the case was held
admissible against him as his admission. In
the instant case too, Exh. P. F F F at best is
an admission by Dost Muhammad respondent
which under section 18 of the Evidence Act,
1872 is admissible against the maker only, and
not against others, even if they are co-accused
with him. To the same effect is Shaharmed v-
The State (P L D 1956 S C (Pak.) 238).

What is important to be noted in
the above reproduced Para is that case of the
prosecution had not been based upon mere
report of the maker being used against him. FIR
in said case had been registered in a counter

case. There had been other substantial evidence

NAWAB (D.8} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

in the case and narrations in the FIR had merely
been used as confirmatory evidence by the
learned trial Court. This fact was itself evident
from Para of the judgment following the above
reproduced Para where the august Supreme
Court had held;

Therefore, the learned trial Judge was not
right to treat Exh. P. F F F, as piece of
confirmatory evidence in the -case except
against the maker. But the point is only
academic, because as pointed out earlier,
other confirmatory evidence, so far as
respondents Nos. 1 to 8 are concerned, is of
over-whelming strength, which coupled with
the direct evidence established the various
offences with which they were charged by the
trial Court, beyond any doubt.

Ratio of the said judgment
cannot be applied to facts of the instant case
where the prosecution was left with no
evidence except statement of the accused
reduced in the shape of ‘Murasila’ Ex. PW-
3/1 on the basis of which FIR in the case in
hand had been registered. Consideration of
the contents of a counter FIR is one thing
but the question before this Court in the
instant appeal has been; “whether conviction

in a capital charge, may solely be based

upon statement of an accused given to the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

police (first responders) and incorporated
into ‘Murasila’ or FIR in a case’? Our
answer to such a question has definitely
been “nays”. Answering the question other
way around would amount to dealing a
statement recorded before police officer at
par with a judicial confession, which can
nowhere be found allowable in our criminal
Justice system, except in the case of a dying
declaration, which is not the situation here.

8. In light of what has been
discussed above, prosecution has not been
able to prove its case against
accused/appellants, beyond reasonable doubt.
Both the appellants are therefore acquitted of
the charges by extending them benefit of
doubt by setting aside the impugned judgment
dated 15.10.2018 of the Court of learned
Additional Sessions-III Swat, on allowing of
the instant appeal. They be released from jail
forthwith if not required in any other case.

9. These are reasons for our short

order of even date, which read as follows;

NAWAB (D.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-14-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this
appeal, set-aside the judgment of conviction dated
15.10.2018 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III Swat in case FIR No. 160 dated
23.08.2016 registered under sections 302,324, 147,
148,149 PPC at police station Shamozai District
Swat and resultantly acquit the appellants namely
Raham Bacha and Saleem Khan of the charges
levelled against them. They be released forthwith if
not required in any other case.”
