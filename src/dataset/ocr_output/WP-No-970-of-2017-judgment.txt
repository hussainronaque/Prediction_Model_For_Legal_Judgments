Appellant-Petitioner

Respondent

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- This order will dispose of Writ
Petition No.970-B/2017, through which petitioner Nisab Ullah
alias Gulap son of Rahmat Ullah Khan seeks quashment of FIR
No.819 dated 02.12.2017 registered under section 489-F PPC at

Police Station Mandan, District Bannu.

2. Brief facts of the case as disclosed in the FIR are
that on 28.11.2017, the respondent No.1 lodged a written report
to the SHO of Police Station Mandan, stating therein that he

had a joint business of construction work with the petitioner,

Thsan (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdu! Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

-2-

the income generated through said business was fraudulently
swallowed by the petitioner, by committing embezzlement of
Rs. Two Crores, the dispute was referred to the arbitration, who
after rendition of accounts, held the petitioner liable to pay Rs.
Sixty Lakhs to the respondent No.1, consequently, he issued a
cheque of Rs. Fifty Lakhs to the respondent No.1, on
04.8.2017, but when the cheque in question was presented in
the bank concerned, it was bounced, consequently, the report of
the respondent No.1 was recorded vide Mud No.16, and after
inquiry, it was incorporated into the FIR, hence, this writ

petition.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner in support of
his contention submits that the petitioner is innocent and has
falsely been implicated in the instant case; that the dispute
between the parties is of civil nature, which can be resolved in
the civil court, criminal proceedings could not have been
initiated against the petitioner; that registration of the case is

outcome of malafide, therefore, the FIR is liable to be quashed.

Ihsan (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

4. We have given anxious thought and consideration
to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the

petitioner and have perused the record with his able assistance.

5. No doubt, on the following grounds, the High

Court can quash the FIR in its constitutional jurisdiction:-

(1) When no offence whatsoever has been disclosed by the

facts alleged in the FIR or the case is of no evidence.

(2) Where on the face of it, investigation of the case is

outcome of malafide.

(3) When contents of FIR showed that matter was purely of
civil nature and criminal proceeding is not warranted by law to

cause harassment to the accused.

(4) Where registration of FIR suffers from serious

jurisdictional defect.

We are aware of the fact that powers under article 199 of the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 can be invoked to quash the
FIR in exceptional cases as discussed above, but the Court

ought to avoid to quash FIR, if on the basis of any allegation

Ihsan (D.B) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

-4-

made by the complainant/prosecution, a prima facie
commission of a cognizable offence is made out against the
accused. The powers vested in the Court under article 199 of
the Constitution are meant to prevent harassment of an accused
but within the premises to serve ends of justice and not to
defeat the same. It is not the function of High Court to judge the
innocence or guilt of accused by minute scrutiny of evidence
rendered by investigating agency against the accused or by
adjudging the credibility of the statements of the prosecution
witnesses. The Court cannot sit as an investigator. Perusal of
the FIR reflects that the allegations levelled against the
accused/petitioner in the impugned FIR were purely factual in
nature and rebuttal by petitioner of such allegations also
necessarily requires holding enquiry by the High Court, which
cannot be done in exercise of power conferred under article 199
of the Constitution. Even otherwise the impugned FIR is still at
investigation stage, and the allegations levelled in the FIR,

prima facie discloses commission of a cognizable offence,

Thsan (DB) Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

-5-
inference at this stage would amount to throttle the

investigation.

6. The upshot of above discussion is that no case for
quashment of FIR is, thus, made out and writ petition is

accordingly dismissed in limine.
