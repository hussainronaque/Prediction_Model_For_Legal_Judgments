No.03 of 2021 sent by the learned trial Court under

Section 374 Cr.P.C for confirmation of death sentence

awarded to convict-appellant namely Raziq Jan.
2. The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on
14.11.2017 Hubaib son of Barakat Shah aged about 8/9
years went missing since 0700 hours and to this effect his
paternal uncle Iqbal Khan son of Amir Zada reported the
matter to the police of Police Station Sarband, which was
recorded in the shape of Daily Diary No.25 dated
15.11.2017 for the purpose of publication of matter that the
minor named above did not return back to his house till
15.11.2017 and inquiry under section-156(3) Cr.PC was
initiated in the matter. However, subsequently, on
24.11.2017 Iqbal Shah and Barakat Shah recorded their
statements under section-164 Cr.PC before the Court of
JMIC, wherein they charged accused Raziq Jan for
kidnapping of the minor Hubaib for the purpose of his
murder/other offence with a motive that Barakat Shah had
prohibited his son Daud from keeping intimacy with the
accused Raziq Jan and consequently, the present case FIR
was registered against accused Raziq Jan under section-
364-A PPC. When accused Raziq Jan was arrested by the
Police on 24.11.2017 vide his card of arrest (EX PW 12/1)

and during interrogation, he named co-accused Ghulam
Rasool and pointed out a pit/grave, where the minor
Hubaib had been buried after strangulation, accordingly
sections-302/201/34 PPC were added in the FIR. Accused
Ghulam Rasool son of Gul Khan was arrested on
27.11.2017. After completion of investigation, challan was
submitted before the Court. The accused were formally
indicted by the trial Court for the offences, to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

3. The prosecution in supports of its case examined as
many as thirteen witnesses.

4. On closure of prosecution evidence, the convict-
appellants were examined under section-342 Cr.PC,
wherein they pleaded innocence and were falsely
implicated in the case by the complainant. However, they
neither wished to record their statements on oath within the
meaning of section-340(2) Cr PC, nor opted to produce
evidence in defence.

5. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated
17.02.2021 convicted and sentenced the appellants in the

manner already discussed above, hence the appellants have
C-)

filed their respective Criminal appeals cited above before
this Court.

6. The learned counsel for the parties were heard and
record gone through with their valuable assistance.

7. Rule of thumb could not be laid down while
appraising a criminal case rather evidence of each case is
to be considered by looking into facts and circumstances of
that particular case. In this case admittedly direct evidence
is not available with the prosecution and it rests on
circumstantial evidence collected during the course of

investigation. Circumstantial evidence brought on record

in this case is the pointation of grave, where the dead body

of the deceased Muhammad Hubaib was buried by the
appellants, confessional statements of the appellants,
statement of PW-5 Muhammad Daud with regard to the
proof of the motive and medical evidence etc.

8. The complainant in his initial report in the shape of
Daily Diary No.25 dated 15.11.2017 has charged none for
the commission of the offence, that report was made to the
extent of missing of the child namely Muhammad Hubaib.

Thereafter on 24.11.2017 statements of complainant Iqbal
Khan (PW-4) and Barakat Shah (PW-3), father of the child
Muhammad Hubaib, were recorded under section 164
Cr.PC, wherein they nominated only the appellant Raziq
Jan, who was arrested on the same date i.e 24.11.2017 and
during the course of his interrogation, he named co-
appellant Ghulam Rasool, subsequently he was also
arrested on 27.11.2017. On the same date, the accused
disclosed that after committing the murder of Muhammad
Hubaib, his dead body was buried in a graveyard situated
in Sango. It is pertinent to mention here that as per
recovery, pointation memo (EX PW 10/5) firstly convict-
appellant Raziq Jan, who deboarded from the vehicle and
he led the police party to the place, where he with the help
of co-appellant Ghulam Rasool had buried the dead body
of the deceased and; thereafter Ghulam Rasool was
deboarded from the vehicle and he also led the police party
and pointed out the place of burial of the dead body of the
deceased. The site plan of the place of pointation is (EX
PW 13/2). It is also pertinent to mention here that the 1.0
has observed in the site plan (EX PW 13/2) that this is an

expansive graveyard and even it is apparent from the site
we

plan (EX PW 13/2) that there are numerous graves in the
said graveyard. It is also a matter of record that first Raziq
Jan has led the police party for the pointation of the grave
of the deceased and subsequently Ghulam Rasool led the
police party to the same place. We will not subscribe to the
contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that it
was a joint pointation for the reason that there are
numberless graves and firstly appellant Raziq Jan has
pointed out the place of burial of the dead body of the
deceased, therefore, the same is admissible to his extent
under Article-40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
while the admissibility of the pointation memo to the
extent of co-appellant Ghulam Rasool will be discussed in
the subsequent paragraphs, because the pointation is not
the sole evidence against the appellants before us. It is also
admitted that from the date of missing of the child namely
Muhammad Hubaib till the pointation, the whereabouts of
the child were not known and; it was in no one’s
knowledge that as to whether the deceased was alive or
dead. Pursuant to this pointation, on the same day,

Investigating Officer vide application (EX PW 13/3)
addressed to the District & Sessions Judge, Peshawar, for
deputing a Magistrate for exhumation of the dead body. On
the very next day, exhumation proceedings were carried
out by the Medical Team comprising of Dr. Anwar Ali, Dr.
Jawad alongwith Shaukat Khan SP Circle, Yasin Khan
DSP Circle, Tehseenullah Khan SHO Sarband, Asif Khan
OII and Gul ‘Wali Khan Inspector OII PS Gulbahar under
the supervision of Judicial Magistrate (PW-2).

9. We are of the firm view that the pointation of the
grave and subsequently the recovery of the dead body of
the deceased with particular reference to the appellant
Raziq Jan has been duly proved by the prosecution by
considering the attending circumstances of the case. In our
view the recovery of the dead body vide exhumation
memo (EX PW 2/7) from the graveyard of village Sangu
by itself sufficient for basing conviction. The prosecution
in order to prove the pointation memo examined two
witnesses i.e Muhammad Riaz ASI (PW-10) and Liaqat
Ali Inspector (PW-11). It is worth mentioning here that
defence has not cross examined these PWs with particular

reference to the pointation memo (EX PW 10/5) and the
same has remained un-rebutted and unchallenged. In this
regard we are fortified by the judgment rendered in Abdul
Samad’s case (PLD 1964 Supreme Court-167), wherein
it is held that;

“Recovery of remains of dead body at instance of
accused from a “very lonely place” four miles away.
In absence of other reason for Police to go to such
place, held, that accused himself led police to place

of recovery.”

Similar view was also affirmed by the Supreme Court of
India (Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) in Criminal Appeal
No.954 of 2005 in case titled “Shanti Devi..vs..State”,
wherein it is also held that;

“16. PW-11, another independent eyewitness, also
confirmed the above factum and recovery of the
dead body at the instance of the appellant. Exhibit
P-29 was the postmortem report prepared by PW-16
Dr.Om Prakash Mahayach alongwith PW-17
Dr.Sunil Kumar Kaushik and PW-18 Dr.Chander
Bhan Midha. The articles which were recovered
alongwith dead body, namely, wrist watch, pair of
shoes, shirt, payaama and empty bag were ail
indentified by PW-2, the son of the deceased. In the
opinion of PW-16, the postmortem doctor, the death
could be a murder as well as natural. Therefore, it is
not, as if based on the postmortem certificate and
the version of PW-16, the offence of murder can be

ruled out. Since the dead body was recovered in a
10

decomposed state, it was quite natural that the
doctor could not specifically state as to the nature of
injury on the body of the deceased. ........... The very
fact that the recovery of the dead body came to be
made at the instance of the appellant and that too
from an adjacent place to the residence of the
appellant was sufficient enough to rope in the

appellant in the murder of the deceased.”

The Supreme Court of Pakistan in identical case titled
Nazir Shehzad’s_and_other reported as (2009 SCMR-
1440) held that;

“Appraisal of evidence. Discovery based on the
information furnished by both the accused to the
Investigating Officer in separate investigations, had
led to the recovery of the dead body from the
“Nallah”—Prior to the said — information
whereabouts of the dead body were not known to
anyone and the same could be used against the
accused under Article-40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat,
1984....Unnatural death of a 18 years old boy was
proved by medical evidence, whose dead body had
been identified by his father after seeing the shoes,
belt and trouser of the deceased....Statements of the
Doctor and father of the deceased having not been
challenged, it could not be said that the dead body
was not identified...Abduction of the deceased for
ransom had been proved through overwhelming
evidence...Complainant and his wife had received
telephone calls demanding ransom and threats on
behalf of accused that in case ransom was not paid

their son would be done to death....Ransom amount
Il

delivered to accused on demand had subsequently
been recovered from him after his arrest....Scooter
belonging to deceased being used by accused was
also recovered from them at the time of their
arrest....Accused had further led to various
recoveries of incriminating articles fully implicating
them in the case....Accused had murdered a student
young boy of 18 years for ransom and no mitigating
circumstance existed in their favour. Appeals of

accused were dismissed in circumstances.”

10. Learned counsel for the appellants have challenged
the evidentiary value of the above mentioned recoveries
and discoveries mainly on the ground that police have not
associated any independent witness with the said process
and posed police officials to the recovery memos in
violation of section-103 Cr.PC. No doubt, attesting
witnesses of the recovery memos in the present case are
mostly police officials, however, it has been repeatedly
held by august Supreme Court of Pakistan that police are
as good as other private witnesses, therefore, their
testimony could not be discarded on the ground of their
status as employees of police department when otherwise
they have supported the recoveries through truthful

statements and no evidence is there to suggest their ill-will
12
towards the appellants. It is also settled principle that
compliance of section-103 Cr.PC is necessary when search
of a house or place is conducted by police for recovery of
something and not in the cases when the recovery is made
on pointation of accused. In this regard we would refer the
judgment of Hon’ble apex Court in the case of
Muhammad_Akbar.vs..The_ State (1995 SCMR 693),
wherein it was held that;

“The objection raised by the learned counsel with
regard to the violation of the provisions of section-
103 Cr.PC by not joining the two respectable of the
locality to witness the recovery is devoid of force. In
the instant case, neither search warrants were
issued by the Magistrate for the search of the house
of the petitioner nor the police had searched the
house/place of its own. The petitioner himself led the
police to his house and pointed the place wherefrom
the gun was recovered. Section-103 Cr.PC would
apply to a case where the police conducts search of
the house/place to recover a thing for which search
is to be made and not to a case where anything is to
be discovered in consequence of the information
given by or on the pointation of the accused. The
recovery, to be made on the pointation of the
accused is relevant under Article-40 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984. The association of the two
respectable inhabitants of the locality is not

required in a case where the accused himself leads
13

the police to a particular place and the thing is

recovered on his information and/or pointation.”

Appellant Raziq Jan was arrested on 24.11.2017 while his
confessional statement was recorded on 28.11.2017,
though question No.4, which he answered in terms that he
was tortured, but, again questions No. 6 & 7 were put to
appellant, which reads;

“Q.6. Do you wish to consult your relatives or

lawyer?
A. No.
Q.7. Are you making the confession voluntarily?
A. Yes.”

The Judicial Magistrate (PW-2) who recorded the
confessional statement of appellant Raziq Jan, has clarified
the answer by stating that; “Answer to question No.4 in
case of accused Raziq Jan is in affirmative. It is correct
that question No.4 is regarding torture, force, threat and
inducement given the accused for making his confessional
statement. The witness volunteered that it was
inadvertently mentioned yes instead of no.”

11. The confessional statement of the appellant Raziq
Jan recorded by the Judicial Magistrate, (PW-2) on

28.11.2017 while that of co-appellant Ghulam Rasool was
14
recorded on 29.11.2017 respectively. The learned trial
Court in para-S of the judgment has discarded the
confessional statements of both the appellants. Since we
are seized of an appeal and Murder Reference as well and
the entire evidence led by the prosecution is to be
reappraised by this Court. We do not subscribe to the view
taken by the learned trial Court by discarding the
confessional statements of both the appellants on the
ground that the accused were handed over back to the
police after recording their confessional statements. It is
noteworthy here that evidence led by the prosecution is to
be appraised accumulatively and not in isolation. In other
words the Court has to see the impact of the entire
evidence led by the prosecution for proving the charge
against the appellants. No doubt that law is there that after
recording the confession, if the accused is handed over to
the police back to some extent affect the credibility of the
confession, but, in this case the confessions recorded by
the appellants are not the only evidence with the

prosecution on file against them as discussed in the
15

preceding paragraph, the dead body was also recovered in
consequence of the information provided by the appellants.
12. Mere fact that the accused was handed over to the
police after recording of confession in all circumstances
shall not be a ground for discarding the confessional
statements, if otherwise, it rings true and voluntary.
Reliance is placed upon the judgment rendered by the
Hon’ble Apex Court in cases titled Muhammad
Sharif..vs..The State (1969 SCMR-521), wherein it is held
that;

“Tf, as suggested, the appellant had for some reason
been under the impression at the time of making the
confession that he would be taken as an approver,
he could not have forgotten to mention it when
explaining why he had made the statement. Judging
from the notes made by PW-44 regarding his
examination of the appellant before recording his
confession to which reference has already been
made we have no reason to doubt his evidence that
he satisfied himself that the confession was being
made voluntarily. As regards the remanding of the
appellant to the police custody, the Magistrate did
so for the purpose of further investigation. The mere
fact that the appellant was remanded to the police
custody cannot be taken as proof that the confession

was not made voluntarily.”
16
13. The confession of the appellant Raziq Jan is
supported by Medical evidence that the deceased was
strangulated. Dr. Faqir Ullah (PW-9) also opined that the
deceased died due to asphyxia due to ligature
strangulation. Furthermore, he put the dead body of
deceased in a sack and admittedly the dead body was
recovered after recoding the confessional statement of the
appellant Raziq Jan and that was packed in a sack and this
fact has also been verified by the doctor (PW-9) that the
dead body was wrapped in a plastic bag; that the body was
putrefied and was emitting foul smell and that the body
was lying in a position with flexed upper and lower limbs.
Even if there are certain omissions, errors or irregularities,
assuming for a while that the confession of the appellant
Raziq Jan was not voluntary, even then, the recovery of
dead body of the deceased is supported by the confessional
statement of co-appellant Ghulam Rasool, which in our
view is sufficient for adjudging the appellant Raziq Jan
guilty. Furthermore, the I.O has also took into possession
motorcycle bearing registration No.LEP-3930-Hero 70CC

red in colour vide recovery memo (EX PW 10/3) upon
17

which appellant Raziq Jan took the dead body of deceased
Hubaib after strangulation after appellant Ghulam Rasool
for burial and both the appellants in their confessional
statements have admitted this fact.

14. The contention of the learned counsel that the dead
body of the deceased was putrefied and decomposed and
this possibility could not be ruled out that the body was not
of the deceased Hubaib. Fazal Shah (PW-6) identified the
dead body of the deceased Hubaib before the doctor at
KMC, Peshawar, and after P.M examination, the dead
body was handed over to them. Shah Zali (PW-7) deposed
that he escorted the dead body of the deceased to the KMC
for P.M examination; that after P.M examination dead
body of the deceased was handed over to the legal heirs of
the deceased and both of them have not been cross
examined by the defence, so the corpus delicti has been
duly proved by the prosecution.

15. Now adverting to the confession of co-appellant
Ghulam Rasool, who was arrested on 27.11.2017, his
confessional statement was recorded on 29.11.2017,

wherein he has narrated the entire episode that how the
18

dead body of the deceased was brought to him by co-
accused Raziq Jan and where the same was buried. His
confession has been duly proved through the statement of
learned Judicial Magistrate (PW-2) who categorically
stated that appellant has admitted his role and the role of
co-appellant in the commission of offence, again it is
reiterated that mere fact that he was handed over back to
the police after recording his confessional statement to the
Naib Court of the Court cannot be considered as a sole
ground for rendering the confessional statement
inadmissible. We are of the firm view that confession
alone is sufficient for basing conviction, if the same is
found to be voluntary and true. Reliance in this regard is
placed upon the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Apex
Court in case titled Khan Muhammad and others..vs..The
State (1999 SCMR-1818).

Even on circumstantial evidence conviction can be
based and in this regard reliance is placed upon the
judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in case

titled Sheraz Tufail..vs..The State (2007 SCMR-518),

wherein it is held that;
19

“Accused was convicted after trial and sentenced to
imprisonment for life, which was maintained by
Federal Shariat Court...Plea raised by accused was
that both the courts had wrongly convicted him on
the basis of circumstantial evidence produced by
prosecution in shape of extra-judicial
confession....Validity....Both the Courts below had
given finding that accused had made confessional
statement voluntarily before his own nearest relative
who appeared as prosecution witness....Confession
of accused was also corroborated with other piece
of evidence recovered during
investigation...Conviction could be awarded on the
basis of circumstantial evidence alone....Both the
Courts below had convicted and sentenced the
accused after proper appreciation of evidence on
record... Concurrent conclusions arrived at by
Courts below could not be interfered by Supreme
Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article-203-
FQ-B) of the Constitution. .... Supreme Court
declined to interfere with the conviction and
sentence awarded by both the Courts below....Leave

to appeal was refused.”

Now coming to the question of conviction and
sentence of appellant Raziq Jan under section-364-A PPC,
it is admitted on record that both the parties are neighbors
and are residing in one and the same Mohailah and even as
per prosecution, the murder of minor Hubaib has taken
place inside the Bhaittak of the house of appellant Raziq

Jan, which is situated in same proximity, therefore,
20

question of abduction would not arise in the circumstances
of the case. In this regard we are fortified by the judgment
rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in case titled “Shams
Saeed Ahmad Khan..vs..Shafaullah and another” (1985
SCMR-1822) and “Muhammad Akhtar..vs..Muhammad
Shafique and another” (1986 SCMR-533). Appellant
Raziq Jan was also convicted and sentenced under section-
201 PPC, as he is also charged for the murder of the
deceased and has been adjudged guilty by this Court,
therefore, his conviction under section-201 PPC is not
sustainable. Therefore, the charges under section-364-A
and under section-201 PPC against appellant Raziq Jan are
set aside and he is acquitted u/s-364-A and section-201
PPC.

Keeping in view the above discussion, the charge
under section-302(b) PPC against appellant Raziq Jan has
been duly proved by the prosecution and the appellant
Raziq Jan has rightly been convicted and sentenced by the
learned trial Court under section 302(b) PPC by awarding
death sentence to him and nothing is available on record,

which could justify the reduction of sentence or the same
21

can be considered as mitigating circumstance, the
compensation of Rs.300,000/- to be paid to the legal heirs
of the deceased under section 544-A Cr. PC is maintained.
The conviction and sentences awarded to the co-appellant
Ghulam Rasool, who buried the dead body of the deceased
in order to conceal evidence and screened the co-appellant
Raziq Jan has been duly proved on record against appellant
Ghulam Rasool beyond reasonable shadow of doubt and
the appellant has rightly been convicted and sentenced by
the learned trial Court.

In light of what has been discussed above and with
the modifications referred in the preceding paragraph with
regard to the sentence of appellant Raziq Jan both the
appeals are dismissed.

Murder Reference No.3 of 2021 sent by the learned
trial Court for confirmation of death sentence awarded to

the appellant Raziq Jan is answered in positive.
