ree
SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellants have called
in question the judgment dated 07.9.2022, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II], Lakki Marwat, whereby the
appellants were convicted, under section 302(b) P.P.C. and
sentenced to imprisonment for life on two counts as taazir
with fine of Rs.10,00,000/- cach as compensation to the legal
heirs of the deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C, or in

convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for two years S.1
along with payment of compensation of Rs.5,000/- cach, to be
paid to the injured/complainant and in default the appellants
shall further undergo 15 days S.J. Under section 337-A(i)

P.P.C, the appellants were convicted and sentenced for
rN

imprisonment to one month and also liable to payment of sum
of Rs.5000/- as “Daman”, cach to be payable to
injured/complainant or in default of payment thereof to further
suffer 15 days S.I. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended in favour of convict/appellants.

2. The complainant, Nadir Khan moved criminal
revision petition No.47-B/2022 for enhancement of sentence
of appellants. Since both the matters have arisen out of the
same judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same
through this common judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case as per contents of F.I.R are
that on 02.6.2017, at 21:30 hours, injured/complainant being
present with dead bodies of his son Abbas Khan and nephew
Dil Jan, reported to police that his niece Mst. Shamshada Bibi
was married to Tauseef. Some three months ago, relation
between the spouses became strained. On the eventful day, he
along with his son Abbas Khan and nephew Dil Jan were
going to the house of his nicce, situated at Ghulam Khel
Adamzai, in order to conciliate the matter. on reaching near
the house of ‘Tauscef, at about 18:45 hours, ‘Tausecf,
Mohibullah sons of Nawaz Khan, Muhammad Nawas son of
Mir Ghaffar and Sikndar son of Muzaffar, duly armed with
Kalashnikovs, came out from Baitak of ‘Tausecf and on secing

the complainant party, all the accused started firing at them
with the intention to kill. Resultantly, Abbas Khan and Dil Jan
got hit and fell down on the ground while he received injury
on his head. Accused after commission of the offence
decamped from the place of incident. Motive has been
disclosed as dispute over womenfolk, hence the ibid F.L.R.

4. Aficr completion of investigation, prosecution
submitted challan against the accused for trial. After
compliance of provisions of section 265-C Cr.P.C, charge
was framed against the accused/appcellants under sections
302/324/337-A(i)/34 P.P.C to which they pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. During the course of trial, accused Sikandar
Khan met his natural death and in this respect Jail
Superintendent furnished his report vide order sheet dated
24.9.2019, as such proceedings against accused Sikandar
Khan were abated. The prosecution in support of its case
produced as many as 11 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence statements of accused was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed innocence and false
implication, however, neither they opted to be examined on
oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to
produce defence evidence. Aficr hearing arguments, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 07.9.2022,
sentenced the accused /appellants as mentioned above, hence,

the instant appeal against the judgment of conviction.
nd 5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties
alongwith learned A.A.G for the State at length and with their

valuable assistance, the record was gone through.
6. The tragedy claimed the lives of two innocent
persons and Iced to an injury to the complainant. The
complainant along with dead bodies was shifted to the hospital
where the matter was reported and the appellants were charged
for the death of the deceased and the injury caused to the
Co complainant. After report of the complainant the injury shect
C a and inquest reports along with injury shect of the complainant
were prepared and thereafter the complainant was referred to
the doctor for his medical examination, who was cxamined by
the doctor and his medico-legal certificate was prepared. ‘The
dead bodies were sent to the doctor and the doctor conducted
autopsy on the dead bodies. ‘The investigating officer after
receiving copy of the I.LR visited the spot, but the spot
proceedings could not be conducted as by then, the
complainant was not available. It was on the next date i.c.
03.6.2017 when the site plan was prepared on the pointation of
the complainant. During spot inspection the investigating
officer collected blood stained carth from the respective places
of the deceased and 21 empties of 7.62 bore lying scattered,
from the places of the accused. It is pertinent to mention that

on the same day, two out of the accused also received fire arm
injuries, who were shifted to the same hospital, where out of
the injured accused Mohibullah reported the matter in respect
of the injuries caused to him and to his co-accused Sikandar.
Both the injured were examined by the doctor and their
medico-legal certificates were prepared. ‘The report made by
the accused Mohibullah was incorporated in F.IL.R No.197,
where Nadir, Sharifullah son of Mumraiz, Dil Jan son of
Sharifullah and Abbas son of Nadir were charged for the
injuries causcd. It is interesting to note that the copy of F.LR
No.197 was also reccived by the investigating officer, who
was present on the spot in connection with the investigation of
case I.L.R No.196. During spot inspection in case F.LR
No.197, the investigating officer collected 15 emptics of 7.62
bore from the places assigned to the accused and also collected
blood stained carth from the places, where the injured after
recciving fire arm injurics, fell down. On one hand the injured/
complainant of case F.I.R No.197 was taken into custody
along with injured Sikandar in the hospital whereas,
complainant of case I'.I.R No.196 was also arrested in case
F.LR Nol97. It is pertinent to mention that on the day of
incident i.c. on 02.6.2017 the accused/ appellant ‘Tauscef, who
was serving in police department attached with Bomb Disposal
Squad, was arrested and was confined in quarter guard of the

Police Lines. The record further tells that on 03.6.2017 the
official Kalashnikov belonging to the accused ‘Tausecf was
taken out from his box by one Sher Nawaz, Khan ASI and the
same was handed over to the incharge BDS who deposited the
same in the Koth and was handed over to the investigating
officer on 14.6.2017. It is interesting to note that investigating
officer addressed an application to the Director General
Forensic Science Laboratory on 14.6.2017, asking an opinion
regarding the recovered weapon and the collected emptics, but
the same were received to the laboratory on 06.7.2017. The
laboratory report was received where out of 21 empties, 11
were shown to have been fired from the recovered weapon,
whereas the remaining were disclosed to have been fired from
different weapons. All the accused except the accused
Sikandar, as he died during trial, after their arrest faced the
trial and on conclusion of the trial, they were convicted and
sentenced, fecling aggrieved the instant criminal appeal.

7. True that in the incident two persons lost their
lives and the complainant got injured, but equally true that
from the other side too, two received fire arm injurics on the
vital parts of their bodies and in such eventuality, it is essential
for this Court to see as to whether the incident occurred in the
mode, manner and at the stated time and as to whether both the
sides came forward with the whole truth. True that the Icarned

trial Court dealt with the matter comprehensively and that after
ns

application of its judicial mind convicted the accused charged,
but it is equally true that this being the Court of appeal is under
the boundened duty to revisit the record of the case and to re-
appreciate the already appreciated cvidence, so that
miscarriage of justice could be avoided. As the incident
occurred in front of the house of the convict/appellants, where
they too got scriously injured, so the attending circumstances
of the present case has increased both, the anxiety and
obligation of this Court to go deep to the roots of the
prosecution’s case, so that miscarriage of justice could be
avoided.

8. The learned trial Court while handing down the
impugned judgment dealt with the matter comprehensively and
that it was mostly, the place of incident, the motive and the
injuries caused to the complainant which persuaded it to
convict, but at the same time little attention was paid to the
injurics causcd to two of the accused/appellants and the
attending circumstances of the present case. In order to gain
clarity, we deem it essential to scan through the record once
again; and to dig out as to whether the approach of the learned
trial Court was correct; and that the finding rendered down was
in accordance with law and finds support from the evidence on

record.
9. In order to comprehend the circumstances of the
case, we deem it cssential to go through the inter-se
relationship between the partics. It is on record that two nicces
of the complainant, who happened to be the sisters of one of
the deccased, were marricd in the house of the
convict/appcllants i.c. onc Shamshada Bibi was marricd to the
convict/ appellant ‘Tauscef whereas another to his brother in
the same house. It is the case of the prosccution that owing to
strain relationship between ‘Tauseef and his wife, the
complainant party was compelled to go and effect a
compromise between the spouses and that on reaching to the
place of incident the tragedy occurred, where the deceased lost
their lives and the complainant got injured. As in the same
incident two from the accuscd side received scrious injuries on
the most vital parts of their bodics, so the question which
needs determination at the carliest is, as to what were the
actual circumstances which led both the sides to the use of
lethal weapons and that in what fashion the incident occurred.
We at this juncture are not in a happy mood to hold that some
of the accused were not present on the spot, as seat of injuries
on the convict/ appellants is a circumstance which tells that
they were present on the spot at the time of incident, but what
concerns us, is that what prompted the parties to fire on each

other which put both the sides in trouble.
10. To begin with, we would like to go through the
statement of the complainant who appeared before the trial
Court as PW-6. The complainant stated that on the day of
incident he along with deceased Icfi their house to the
village of the accused to effect a compromise between the
accused Tausecf and his wife, as the convict/ appellant
Tauseef had contracted second marriage which turned to be
the basis of strained relationship between the spouses; that
soon they reached near the house of the accused, all the
accused duly armed, started firing at them which led to the
death of the deceased and injury to the complainant; that
aftcr receiving fire arm injury, he and the dead bodies were
lying on the ground and that it was after 40 minutes of the
incident that cots were arranged, the deceased were shifted
and on availability of Datsun/pick-up, the dead bodies and
the complainant were shifted to the hospital, where the
matter was reported. It is interesting to note that the
complainant, right from the beginning till the end,
maintained silence regarding the injurics caused to the
accused and while reporting the matter, he suppressed this
material aspect of the case. From the spot 2! empties of 7.62
bore were collected from the places of convicts/appcellants
and blood stained carth from places of the deceased, but also

in the counter case i.c. F.I.R No.197, 15 empties were
-10-

collected from the places assigned to the complainant and
the deceased and blood stained carth from the places of the
injured, which indicates that if on one hand two persons lost
their lives and the complainant received injuries, then on the
other two accused also received serious injurics on their
bodies. In order to substantiate this particular aspect of the
case, we went through the statement of the investigating
officer. The investigating officer was examined as PW-8,
who stated that after receiving copy of the I’.I.R he visited
the spot, but could not prepare the site plan as the
complainant was not available; that on the very next day on
the availability of the complainant he prepared site plan and
effected the recoveries from the spot. This witness further
conlirms that on the same day he also prepared the site plan
in case F.I.R No.197 and that recoveries were also cffected
and in that respect the recovery memos were prepared. The
investigating officer was categoric in holding that both the
cases are the cross-cases. The investigating officer was
examined on material aspects of the case, more particularly,
the arrival of the complainant party to the spot and their
active participation in firing. The investigating officer
admitted that the complainant side came to the spot duly
armed and that from their firing two of the appellants

received scrious injuries. The investigating officer also
-Il-

mentioned in the site plan the respective places of the
injured/ appellants, from-where blood stained carth was
collected. Even during spot inspection the investigating
officer noticed bullet marks on the walls of the Baitak of
accused Tausecf. It is interesting to note that when the
complainant was cross-examined he introduced another
story by disclosing that, he was told that when the accused
committed the offence, they left the spot and after covering
a distance of 30 minutes, reached Kharoba, where his
nephews were already present duly armed, fired at them and
that it was from their fire-shots, the convicts/ appellants
received fire arm injurics. IIe further disclosed that none of
the appellants received injurics on the spot and that they
never fired at the accused party. If we admit to what the
complainant stated regarding the occurrence at Kharoba
then, it is for the complainant to convince, that who
informed his nephews regarding the occurrence and the
decamping of the appellants towards Kharoba. It is of prime
importance to note that no site plan regarding the incident at
Kharoba was prepared and even the investigating officer did
not visit the place, where allegedly the accused/ appellants
received fire arm injuries. When the investigating officer
was asked regarding this particular aspect of the case, he

categorically denied any incident to have occurred at
-1]2-

Kharoba. When such is the state of affairs, we lurk no doubt
in mind in holding that the complainant has concealed the
real facts. The conscious attempt of the complainant to
introduce another story regarding the injurics caused to the
appellants, clearly tells that the incident did not occur in the
mode and manner as disclosed by the complainant. The
_7 scribe who was examined as PW-4 stated that on the day of
incident he along with police constables was on Gasht and
alter recciving information regarding the arrival of the dead
bodies to the hospital, he reached to the hospital, where the
complainant reported the matter; that afler preparation of the
injury-shect and inquest report, the complainant was sent to
the doctor for his medical examination and the dead bodies
for post mortem examination; that soon thereafter the
injured/ appellants were brought to the hospital where the
convicV appellant Mohib Ullah reported the matter which
was taken in shape of murasila. During cross-cxamination
he admitted both the cases as cross cases. The injured were
examincd by the doctor, their medico-legal certificates were
prepared, the doctor mentioned the duration of injuries on
the bodies of both the injured from 2 to 3 hours, and when
this time is taken in juxtaposition with the time of
occurrence, it confirms that the injured received the injuries

at the time given by the complainant in case FIR No.196.
-13-

11. We are to determine that which of the parties is
responsible and which not, and in order to determine the
responsibilities of the partics concerned, we deem it
essential to re-visit the motive and the purpose of visiting
the place of incident by the complainant and the deceased.
The record tells that all the three Icft their house to mediate
between the spouses as their relation had turned bad and
when the statement of the complainant is taken into
consideration, there too, he disclosed that the
convicVappellant ‘lauscef had entered into second marriage
which turned to be the basis of strained relationship between
the spouses, so they visited the place to settle the
differences. But the record docs not support the stance of the
complainant. If the complainant and others had an intention
to bring the spouses at case, then instead of Icaving their
house a little carlicr from breaking the fast, they would have
cither waited to break their fast or would have gone much
carlicr to the house of Tauseef to negotiate, but the hasty
leaving of their house confirms their intention and it was
becausc of such a haste that the unwanted incident occurred.
The complainant admitted in his Court statement that prior
to leaving their house they did not inform ‘Tauscef and his
family of their arrival to their house, for the purpose, but

when they reached to the place of incident they were fired
-14-

at. This is still astonishing thal when convict/ appellant
Tauseef and his family were not informed regarding their
arrival, then how on reaching to the spot they were fired at,
as by that time neither an altercation had taken place
between the partics nor the partics sat to settle the
differences. If the motive is the one which has been given by
the complainant then, the incident did not occur in the
manner given by the complainant, but what we can assess
from the attending circumstances of the present case, is that,
that the partics went in altercation, the situation went from
bad to worse and the complainant side who was duly armed
started firing and as a result the accused party resorted to
firing as well. If the intention was to negotiate then the
complainant would have visited the spot unarmed, but the
collection of empties from the places of the complainant
party is another circumstance which tells that the
complainant side visited the spot with the sole purpose to
kill. Even the bullet marks on the walls of the Baitak of the
convict’ appellant Tauseef is another circumstance which
clarify the active involvement of the complainant and
deceased in firing as well. The seat of injurics on body of
the convict/appellants confirms that these were not self
inflected. Right from the beginning till the end the

complainant struggled hard to make believe that it was the
-15-

accused party who fired at them and they never involved in
the episode and that no firing was made from their side. The
complainant was blowing hot and cold in the same breath, as
on one hand he denies the incident to have occurred in the
manner as disclosed by the investigating officer, whereas on
the other, he admitted the injuries on the bodies of the
convict/ appellants, but at the hands of his nephews, away
from the place of incident, but the recoverics of emptics
from the places assigned to them and the blood stained carth
from the places of the injured/ appellants confirm their
participation in the incident, and a circumstance which
cannot be ignored. From the attending circumstances of the
present case, this Court is firm in its belief that both the
sides suppressed the real facts and consciously attempted to
create an atmosphere of uncertainty.

12. It was argued from the complainant’s side that
the injuries received by the convict/ appellants cannot be taken
in favour of the defence as in such eventuality, it was the
obligation of the defence to take a plea from the very
beginning, which it did not and that when a plea is not taken
the Court by itself cannot appreciate that aspect of the case.
We are not convinced with what the learned counsel for the
complainant submitted, as the circumstances of the present

case by itself are sufficient to tell that it was the complainant
-16-

side who attracted to the spot, duly armed and that it was their
this intention which led to the tragedy, so in such eventuality
the possibility cannot be excluded that it was the complainant
side, who went aggressor, that too, by the time when the fast
was yet to be broken. In case titled “Abdur Rahim Vs, the
State” (2021 YLR Note 139), it has becn held that:
“The factum of suppression of real facts of
the appellant by both the sides, are the
circumstances suggesting the act of firing by
the appellant to have been committed in
exercise of his defence, the benefit of which
can be extended to him irrespective of the
fact that he did not specifically take that plea
during trial. Reliance is placed on case titled
"Ghulam Fareed v. The State" (2009 SCMR
929), wherein it has been held that:
"The appellant did not raise this
plea during trial either in his
statement under section 342,
Cr.P.C. or at the time when the
prosecution witnesses were
subjected to cross-examination.
There is no bar to raise such plea

despite having not taken the said
-17-

plea specifically during trial, and

the court can infer the same from

the evidence led during trial, if the

same is tenable. However, to justify

such an inference, in favour of the

accused who stands convicted on a

murder charge and sentenced to

death, his conduct during the

occurrence should fall within the

parameters of private defence, as

codified in the Pakistan Penal

Code.""”
13. The cumulative effect of what has been discussed
above, Icads this Court nowhere, but to hold that there was
aggression on part of the complainant and that the appellants
were to retaliate. As the complainant side exceeded the limits
and the accused realized a threat to their lives, so in that
eventuality one side received serious injuries, whereas the
other got two dead and one injured. ‘Truc that casualties from
one side are higher than the other, but it is equally truc that
these are not the casualtics which should be the determining
factor, rather this is the attitude of the parties which must be
taken into consideration and as the convicts/appellants too

received scrious injuries on the most vital parts of their bodies,
-18-

so we cannot exclude the possibility that they just retaliated to
save their lives. When the two versions regarding the same
incident comes with the twisted facts, then courts are to decide
the genuineness and the same is possible only and only when
the attending circumstances of a particular case are taken into
consideration, while applying the test this Court without any
hesitation holds that the complainant side was the aggressor.

14. As the complainant in his court statement
introduced new story and also could not explain the
circumstances which led to the incident, so in such eventuality,
it is for this Court to determine the same. If we accept for a
whilc that the purpose was to reconcile the spouses then, we
failed to understand that how the accused came to know
regarding their approach to the place of incident and that why
instead of talking to each other, firing was made at once, which
resulted into the death of the deceased and injuries to the
complainant. In this particular issue two most important
witnesses are the nieces of the complainant, and sisters of one
of the deceased, who were married in the house. None of the
ladies were produced before the investigating officer and even
before the learned trial Court to confirm the stance of the
complainant. This is surprising that complainant in his Court
statement stated, that the sisters of the deceased attracted to the

spot soon after the incident, but the investigating officer
-19-

remained silent on that particular aspect of the case. If the
tragedy occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time,
that too, owing to the strained relationship between the
spouses, then in such eventuality, the wife of the accused/
appellant Tauscef would have deposed against her husband,
with whom she was not enjoying good relations, but neither
she appeared nor she was examined which in fact can be
interpreted in no other manner, but that she was not ready to
support the false claim of the complainant. This is surprising
that despite the fact that real brother of Mst. Shamshada Bibi
was killed in the incident, but till datc, both the sisters are
living a happy life in the house of appellants, which further
negates the stance of the complainant, as in the incident motive
was the most essential clement and for the same the material
witnesses were the sisters of the deceased, but their non-
production can be taken only and only against the complainant
and inference can be drawn under Article 129 (g) of Qanoon-c-
Shahadat Order, 1984. In this regard, wisdom could also be
derived from the judgment rendered by the Apex Court in case
titled “Lal Khan Vs The State” (2006 SCMR_ 1846) in which
it was held that:
“The prosecution is certainly not required
to produce a number of witnesses as the

quality and not the quantity of the evidence
-20-

is the rule but non-production of most
natural and = material witnesses of
occurrence, would strongly lead to an
inference of prosecutorial misconduct
which would not only be considered a
source of undue advantage for possession
but also an act of suppression of material
facts causing prejudice to the accused. The
act of withholding of most natural and a
material witness of the occurrence would
create an impression that the witness if
would have been brought into witness-box,
he might not have supported the
prosecution and in such eventuality the
prosecution must not be in a position to
avoid the consequence.”
15. The convict/appellant Tauscef admittedly, was
serving in the police department, attached with Bomb Disposal
Squad during the days of incident. The record tells that on the
day of incident, he was arrested and put in quarter guard as he
was charged in the instant case. This is interesting to note that
on 03.6.2017, his official rifle was taken into possession from
his official box, lying in police lines and the same was handed

over to the investigating officer on 14.6.2017. This is for the
-21-

prosecution to explain that how, when and wherefrom the
convict/ appellant Tauscef was arrested and that who arrested
him and who put him in the quarter-guard. ‘The investigating
officer was asked regarding this particular aspect of the case,
but he too could not explain that who and from where the
appellant was arrested. This is further surprising that record is
silent that who took the official rifle in possession from
possession of the convict/ appellant Tauseef and who put it
into the box belonging to the accused, lying in the Police
Lines, but no evidence has been collected by the investigating
officer in that respect. The investigating officer mentioned one
Sher Nawaz Khan, ASI that it was he who handed over the
weapon to Noor Kamal, but neither the said Noor Kamal
recorded statement of Sher Nawaz ASI, incharge Bomb
Disposal Squad, nor the investigating officer recorded his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. When the witnesses are
silent regarding the arrest and recovery and when the witnesses
could not explain that wherefrom the accused/ appellant
Tauseef was arrested, then in such eventuality, this piece of
evidence cannot be taken into consideration until corroborated.
The investigating officer took the Kalashnikov into his
possession on 14.6.2017 and on that very date an application
was addressed to the Director General Forensic Science

Laboratory, but surprisingly the weapon along with the
-22-

recovered empties were received to the laboratory on
06.7.2017, aficr a considerable delay of more than one month.
On one hand the witness admits that the recovered
Kalashnikov was not sealed by the investigating officer and by
the police official who took the same from the box, whereas on
the other the collected empties and the weapon were received
to the laboratory after a considerable delay of more than one
month. In this respect neither the investigating officer
examined Muharrir of the concerned police station nor the
official who took the same to the Forensic Science Laboratory.
When the most relevant witnesses have not been produced then
in such eventuality this Court lurks no doubt in mind that the
prosecution failed to prove safe custody of the collected
empties and recovered weapon. When such is the state of
affairs, this Court is not in a happy mood to take into
consideration the laboratory report, against the
convicts/appellants.

16. As the unfortunate incident occurred, because of
the alleged strained relation between the spouses and the
purpose of visiting the place of the accused was to bridge the
differences between the two, but neither Mst Shamshada Bibi
was examincd by the investigating officer nor another sister of
the deceased who is married in the house. The investigating

officer could not collect independent evidence in that respect
-23-

and as such, the motive advanced by the complainant could not
be established on record. True that absence or weakness of
motive hardly plays a role to dislodge the prosecution case
provided, it inspires confidence, but in the case in hand as
purpose was to bridge the differences between the spouses and
that it was because of this reason that the deceased lost their
lives, so it was essential for the prosecution to prove the same,
but it did not, which has damaged the prosecution’s case
beyond repair. In case titled “Muhammad Ilyas vs Ishfaq
alias Munishi_and others” (2022 YLR_ 1620), it was held
that:

“So far as motive is concerned. Though

the prosecution is not under legal

obligation to set up a motive. Ordinarily

the absence or weaknesses of motive in

murder case cannot be considered to

justify the acquittal. It is well settled that

once a motive is set up it is imperative for

the prosecution to prove the same. On

failure whereof adverse inference can be

dawn against the prosecution. Reference

is made to the cases of Muhammad Khan

v. Zakir Hussain PLD 1995 SC 590 and

Hakim Ali v .The State 1971 SCMR 432.”

17, The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this court nowhere, but to hold that the
prosecution failed to bring home guilt against the appellants
and the impugned judgment is suffering from inherent defects
and is lacking reasons, which calls for interference. The instant
criminal appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside, and the convict appellants are acquitted of the charges.
They be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

18. As the criminal appeal against conviction is
allowed and the impugned judgment is sct aside, so the
connected Criminal Revision Petition No.47-B of 2022 has
lost its efficacy which is dismissed as such. These are the
detailed reasons for our short order of even date.
