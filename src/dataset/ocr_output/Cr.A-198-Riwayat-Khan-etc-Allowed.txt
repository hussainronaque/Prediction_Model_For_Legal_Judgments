JUDGMENT
KKK

AHMAD ALI, J. Through this common

judgment we would propose to decide the
connected Cr.R No.66-P/2016 & Cr.A No.260-
P/2016 which are the outcome of one and the
same judgment dated 12.03.2016 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Peshawar, whereby
the appellants Riwayat Khan s/o Mirza Khan &
Tariq alias Sariq s/o Abdul Kabir, were convicted
and sentenced to life imprisonment with payment
of compensation amount of Rs.200,000/- each to
the LRs of deceased u/s 544-A Cr.P.C or in
default thereof to suffer 6 months SI each, in case

FIR No.680 dated 19.12.2012 under sections
302/324/34 PPC, Police Station, Sarband

(Peshawar).

2. Brief facts of the case are that
complainant/Abizar, while accompanying the
dead body of his brother Sultan Room, reported
the matter to local police to the effect that on
19.12.2012, he along with his brother Sultan
Roam deceased (then injured) was present in
front of their house in the fields, in the
meanwhile, Riwayat Khan & Tariq alias Sariq
(accused-appellants) along with Wahid Ali
(absconding co-accused/PO) appeared there, duly
armed with firearms and started firing at them, he
remained unhurt but as a result of firing his said
brother was hit and injured. Deceased (then
injured) was shifted to hospital with the help of
co-villagers but succumbed to injuries on the
way. Motive for the occurrence was stated to be
previous altercation. Besides, the complainant the
occurrence was also stated to have been
witnessed by one Hamid Ali and_ others.
Accordingly, FIR against the above named
accused was registered.

2. On completion of investigation, challan
was submitted in Court where the accused-

appellants were charge-sheeted to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced
and examined as many as thirteen witnesses
whereafter statement of the accused were
recorded, wherein, they professed _ their
innocence. The learned Trial Court, after
conclusion of trial, found the appellants guilty of
the charge and, while recording their conviction,
sentenced them as mentioned above. Feeling
aggrieved, the appellants have jointly filed the

instant appeal before this Court.

3. Arguments heard and record gone through.
4. It was the case of prosecution that the said
occurrence was witnessed by complainant
(brother of the deceased) and one Hamid Ali
(nephew of the deceased) and certain other
people of the locality who came out from their
house after hearing the fire shots.

5. First we have to see that whether
complainant could prove his presence on the
spot of occurrence at the relevant time or not. It
has been stated by the complainant in his
statement recorded as PW-8 that he is a
computer technician in Sheikh Zayed Islamic
Centre University of Peshawar. Further stated

that he was on leave on the day of occurrence as
his brother was scheduled to fly abroad on the
following day i.e. the day next to the day of
occurrence. It is further stated by complainant
that he has not shown any document to the IO
regarding his leave on the day of occurrence.
The complainant negated the suggestion that he
was informed regarding the death of his brother
at the place of his duty and later on rushed to the
Khyber Teaching Hospital. He further deposed
that they were close to the hospital when his
deceased brother succumbed to the injuries.
Complainant also narrated that the altercation
which he has disclosed as motive behind the
incident took place, a month prior to the
occurrence. He also deposed in his examination
that the ‘cot’ was brought by the inmates of the
house who attracted to the spot on the report of
fire shots, after the firing at deceased, inmates of
his house came out and saw the accused.
Complainant further disclosed that his wife,
sister-in-law (widow of deceased) and daughter-
in-law of the deceased came out of the house on
the report of fire shots and they all had seen the
accused.

6. The other eye witness, namely, Hamid Ali

(nephew of the deceased) was produced by the
prosecution as PW-9 who stated in his court

statement;

“I have not noticed any body attracting to the spot
on hearing the fire shots from the house of

complainant/my paternal uncle Abizar”

7. IO of the case appeared before the learned

Trial Court as PW-11, who deposed that;

“It is correct that in the instant case while going
through the report of the complainant, he i.e.
complainant has not shown a specific reason for
being present on the spot......... I have not shown
the distance between the complainant and accused
facing trial Riwayat i.e. between points No.2 &
Sr it is not in my knowledge being the IO of
the case and investigating the whole case that
whether complainant of the case namely, Abizar is a
Computer Technician at Sheikh Zaid Islamic
Centre, Peshawar.............. it is correct that the
complainant of the case has not shown me any
passport or any ticket showing the deceased
scheduled for leaving abroad the next day of the
occurrence. I have not recorded the statements of
Mst. Pashmina, widow of deceased, Mst. Nageena,
wife of the complainant and Mst. Hina, wife of Izhar
and daughter-in-law of the deceased, that they had
come out of their house after hearing the firing and

had seen the accused on the spot.”

The assertion in respect of leaving abroad of the
deceased is taken into consideration, for the
reason, that it was the stance of complainant that
he was on leave because the deceased was
proceeding abroad. But, the IO did not bother to
bring anything on record in support of said
version of the complainant.

8. Contrarily, the defence produce DW-I,

Professor Dr. Muhammad Khan, Director,
Sheikh Zayed Islamic Centre University of
Peshawar, who brought the leave Register and

categorically stated that;

“Today I am present with the Casual Leave Register
wherein Mr. Abizar, Junior Computer Technician is
shown to have availed casual leave for the last time
on 20.12.2012 and the previous one was on
05.12.2012. Between these two dates there is no
casual leave on behalf of Mr. Abizar according to
my record. Copy of relevant page is Ex.DWI/1

(original seen and returned)”

In cross examination this witness deposed that;

“It is correct that the application Ex.DX/3 is for the
short leave of the complainant Abizar which is dated
19.12.2012. He has asked for leave from 8:15 till
10:15 AM on 19.12.2012. (STO: by defence counsel:
that the same is photocopy and attested hence
inadmissible in evidence). I allowed the said
application as per rule. The witness volunteered that
this application was given to me by Abizar on
24.12.2012, however, the aid application for short
leave was written on 19.12.2012 while submitted the

same on 24.12.2012”

This witness i.e. DW-1 was re-examined on
16.05.2015 and in his re-examination, he

narrated very important facts by deposing that;

“The Establishment Assistant came to me and
informed that the relevant page of attendance of
dated 19.12.2012 is missing from the register,
whereby a fake page containing signatures and
attendance of the officials of the department was
prepared and placed on the register by the present
complainant Abizar, the copy of which is Ex.DW1/3,
but the original of the same was also later on

removed from the said register”

He further stated that;

“I called the official whose signatures were affixed
on the Ex.DW1/3 to verify regarding the same from
them, they all denied their said signatures and in
this respect the verification of signatures of the
officials in writing is Ex.DW1/4 (original seen and

returned)”
In his cross-examination, he once again clarified
the fact by saying that;

“I have signed the shot leave application
of the complainant on 24.12.2012 the day
when the same was presented to me. Short
leave application was for a short leave of
dated 19.12.2012. Witness volunteered that
the said date 19.12.2012 was written by the
complainant and not me. Prior to allowing
the said short leave application I have gone
through the same, generally we look at the
subject in the application and then sign it.
Although the short leave register had
already been disposed of, however,
application of the complainant regarding
short leave was placed on his personal file
maintained by the Establishment Assistant.
It is correct that in EX.DX/3 bears my
signature but does not bear the date i.e.
24.12.2012. It is incorrect to suggest that I
have subsequently mentioned the date

24.12.2012.”

9. The most important piece of evidence in
the instant case was the short leave application
of the complainant which are two in number;
one is Ex.DX/3 which was produced by the
complainant. Same is reproduced below for

ready reference:-

Which means that the complainant was actually
present in his office on the day of occurrence
and he was informed by someone about the
occurrence. He left the office without obtaining
short leave, later on it was 24.12.2012 when the
complainant rejoin his office and submitted his

short leave application by mentioning the date as
19.12.2012, but the competent authority i.e.
DW-I signed the same and mentioned the date as
24.12.2012.

2. It is also important to note that the
complainant stated in the FIR that he was on
leave on the day of occurrence as his brother
(deceased) was going back to abroad but in his
application for short leave he mentioned that his
son was ill that is why he want short leave, but as
lie has no legs to stand upon. So, complainant
tried his level best to prove his presence on the
spot on the day of occurrence but in vain. The
maxim ‘falsus in unu, falsus in omnibus’ is
applicable with full force. It has been held in

recent ceremonial judgment of the apex Court

reported in PLJ 2019 SC (Criminal Cases) 265,
which reads as under:-

“The rule falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus---
Latin phrase---meaning thereby “false in one
thing, false in everything”...Held: A witness who
lied about any material fact must be disbelieved
as to all facts-- ‘Falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus’ is a Latin phrase meaning “false in
one thing, false in everything”...The rule held
that a witness who lied about any material fact
must be disbelieved as to all facts because of the
reason that the “presumption that the witness
will declare the truth ceases as soon as it
manifestly appears that he is capable of
perjury” and that “Faith in a_ witness’s
testimony cannot be partial or factional...The
rule was first held not o apply to cases in
Pakistan in case of Ghulam Muhammad and

others Vs Crown (PLD 1951 Lahore 66) and
10

judgment was authored by Muhammad Munir,
CJ--This view stems from notion that once a
witness is found to have lied about a material
aspect of a case, it cannot then be safely
assumed that said witness will declare truth
about any other aspect of case---Maxim has not
been accepted by superior Courts in Pakistan--
Supreme Court of Pakistan has dealt with rule
in different cases till date--Job of a judge was to
discover truth earlier rule falsus in uno, falsus
in omnibus is inapplicable in this country
practically encourages commission of perjury
which is a serious offence in this country---A
Court of law cannot permit something which
law expressly forbids---With all due respect, we
feel that such an approach, which involves
extraneous and practical considerations, is
arbitrary besides, being subjective and same
can have drastic consequences for rule of law
and dispensation of justice in criminal matters--
-when a witness has been found false with
regard to implication of one accused about
whose participation he had deposed on oath
credibility of such witness regarding
involvement of other accused in same
occurrence would be irretrievably shaken---A-
fore-discussed main rule shall suffer serious
change if an when it is examined in light of
Islamic Principles---The Holy Qur’an deals with
matter---It can be seen that giving testimony its
due importance and weight is an obligatory
duty and those who stands firm in their
testimonies are among people of righteousness
and faith---According to corpus of traditions of
Holy Prophet (PBUH), false testimony is one of
greatest sins---Offence of Qazf, which has been
defined---It can be seen that Holy Qur’an puts a
great emphasis upon need to meet requisite
standard of evidence, so much so, that for a
person leveling allegation of Zina but not
meeting given standard, it not only provides for
a penal punishment, but also for withdrawal of
such a person’s civic right to give evidence in all
matters of his life---A court of law cannot grant
a license to a witness to till lies or to mix truth
with falsehood and then take it upon itself to sift
grain from chaff when law of land makes
perjury are testifying falsely a culpable offence--

- A Court also has no jurisdiction to lay down a
11

principle of law when even Parliament is
expressly forbidden by Constitution for
enacting such a_ principle as_ law---
Inapplicability of this rule in Pakistan was
introduced by Chief Justice Muhammad Munir
in the year, 1951, when Article 227 of
Constitution was not in field but after
introduction of said constitutional prohibition
enunciation of law by his lordship in this field,
like infamous doctrine of necessity introduced
by his lordship in constitutional field, may not
hold its ground now--- A judicial system which
permits deliberate falsehood is doomed to fail
and a society which tolerates it is destined to
self-destruct----Truth is foundation of justice
and justice is core and bedrock of a civilized
society and, thus, any compromise on truth
amounts to a compromise on a society’s future
as a just, fare and _ civilized society---Our
judicial system has suffered a lot as a
consequence of above mentioned permissible
deviation from truth and it is about time that
such a colossal wrong may be rectified in all
earnestness---Therefore, in light of discussion
made above, we declare that rule falsus in uno,
falsus in omnibus shall henceforth be an
integral part of our jurisprudence in criminal
cases and same shall be given effect to, followed
and applied by all courts in country in its letter
and spirit---It is also directed that a witness
found by a court to have resorted to a deliberate
falsehood on a material aspect shall, without

any latitude, invariably be proceeded against

for committing perjury”.

10. As the complainant is disbelieved, so, the
evidence of other eyewitness, namely, Hamid
Ali/PW-9 is also not worth reliable, hence
discarded, as he has also stated that complainant
was an eyewitness, but the record proved that
complainant was not, at all, present at the spot of

occurrence. Case law refers: NLR 2015 Cr.C 186.
12

11. The Recovery Memo Ex.PW6/2 reveals
that 41 fresh discharged empties of 7.62 bore
were recovered from the spot, but to our utter
surprise, the same were sent to FSL on
19.03.2013, after a considerable delay of about
three months. There is also nothing on record
that in whose custody the crime empties were
remained during the intervening period. In the
circumstances, the aspect of manipulation/
tampering with the crime empties could not be
ruled out. Even, otherwise, keeping in view the
number of accused charged in the FIR, the FSL
report does not suggest that whether the firing
was made from one, two or three weapons
because in the FSL report, the word “different
weapons” is used, without specifying the
number of weapons used in the commission of
offence, which creates doubts in the prosecution
case qua number of accused in the instant case.

12. Apart from the above, the female inmates
of the house of complainant who were stated to
have seen the accused at the time of occurrence,
being material witnesses, were not produced. So,
in the situation, not only adverse inference under
Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984

can be safely drawn, but the legal inference
13

could also be drawn that if the said witnesses
had entered into the witness box then they would
not have supported the prosecution case. In this
regard wisdom can be safely derived from case
law reported in NLR 2015 SCJ 121 & PLD
2016 SC 17.

13. Similarly, the driver of the Suzuki in
which the deceased (then injured) was shifted to
the hospital was also not examined. He was also
an important witness who could bring the real
facts that who accompanied him to the hospital
and whether complainant was with him or not.
We are forfeited to seek guidance from the case
law reported in NLR 2015 SCJ 121 & 2018
SCMR 153.

14. Apart from the above, the complainant is
the brother of deceased, who showed
extraordinary strange conduct after having seen
his brother murdered and tried his level best to
suppress certain facts proving that it was an
unwitnessed occurrence and he had seen just the
deceased (then injured) and not the occurrence in
action. Exclusion of the said witness from
consideration would result that no evidence was
left on record to connect the accused with the

crime because the rest of the evidence is
14

corroborative piece of evidence. Reference can
be made to case law reported in 1984 SCMR 42,
PLD 1981 SC 472, 1972 SCMR _ 578, 2007
SCMR 1825, 1990 SCMR 158 & 2011 SCMR
474. Even, otherwise, testimony of close related
witnesses is required to be scrutinized with great
care and caution, especially when the witness is
interested and inimical and is, thus, likely to
falsely implicate the accused. It is essential to
seek independent corroboration which is lacking
in the instant case. Moreover, while appreciating
the evidence, court had to take _ into
consideration, omission, improvements,
embellishments etc, had been of such magnitude
that they might materially affect the trail, and
where there are doubts about the testimony, the
Court would insist on corroboration. Guidance
could be safely sought from the case law laid
down in 2015 P.Cr.L.J 81.

15. Moreover, the accused-appellant is the ex-
husband of sister of complainant, who was
divorced by the appellant, therefore, the
circumstances of the case suggest that the
complainant might have dragged the present
appellant in the instant case for that very reason

and proved himself by his conduct to be an
15

interested witness. Wisdom is derived from the
dicta reported in NLR 2015 UC 128 & 2019
P.Cr.L.J 401.

16. The learned trial while acquitting the
accused from the charge under section 324 PPC
has also affixed a stamp of affirmation on the
non presence of complainant and has, thus,
proved him to be telling lie in respect of firing
upon him. Principle of ‘falsus in uno, falsus in
omnibus” is fully applicable here. Believing
such assailable evidence by the Court of law
would be definitely against the administration of
criminal justice resulting into judicial death of an
innocent accused.

17. The crux of afore-mentioned discussion is
that either the prosecution witnesses were not
present on the spot or they are not telling the
truth. Prosecution has miserably failed to build
any nexus of the accused-appellants with the
commission of the offence. We are forfeited by

the case law laid down in PLJ 2019 SC

(Criminal Cases) 265.

18. Bia pake add shve de... namuna da
...-.» While trying a criminal case, it
is the duty of the Court to appraise

evidence strictly according to the
legal requirements, described by
law without being swayed away
emotionally for any other
extraneous reasons, which fall
outside the pale of legal jurisdiction
of appraisement of evidence. In the
criminal jurisprudence which is
followed, it is invariably the duty of
the prosecution to prove the ease
against accused beyond doubt and
the accused is presumed to be
innocent until the case fully proved
against him and in that process not
only if there is room for doubt,
benefit thereof is to go to the
accused but if any legal provision,
which to be retied upon in the
appraisement of evidence and is
open to two interpretations, the one
beneficial to the accused, is to be
adopted. The Court is to administer

the laws as are operative in the
17

country and if such laws fail to
achieve the desired results, then it is
the duty of the legislature to amend
them suitably to make them
effective. Court is not permitted to
deviate from the principles and
guidelines laid in the law _ for
appraisement of evidence. To bring
home guilt to the accused, legal
evidence is required to be of
incriminating nature to connect
accused with the commission of
crime beyond the shadow of
reasonable doubt. Reliance could be
safely placed on case law reported

in PLD 1995 SC 1.

19. The above discussion has led this Court to
believe that the learned trial court has erred in
appreciating the case evidence in its true
perspective. It has been held, time and again by
the superior courts, that a slightest doubt occurs
in the prosecution case is sufficient to grant

acquittal to an accused. For giving the benefit of
18

doubt, it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. Single
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in the
prudent mind about the guilt of accused makes
him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of
grace in concession, but as a matter of right.
Reliance could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230,
2011 SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD
SC _ 433, 2012 MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR 1825,
2008 P.Cr.L.J_376, 1994 PLD Peshawar 114,
2012 PLD Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J_1087,
1997 SCMR_ 449, 2011 SCMR 820 & 2006
P.Cr.L.J_SC 1002. The conclusions drawn by
the learned trial Court are not borne out of the
case evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment

is not sustainable.

7. For what has been discussed above and
while extending benefit of doubt to the
appellants, this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellants are
acquitted of the charge levelled against them.
They be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to

be detained in any other case.

8. As the judgment of the learned Trial Court

is set aside, therefore, the connected Criminal
19

Revision No.66-P/2016 has become infructuous
and is dismissed accordingly. Resultantly, the
connected appeal against acquittal ie. Cr.A
No.260-P/2016, being meritless, also stands

dismissed.

9. Above are the reasons of short order of

even date.
