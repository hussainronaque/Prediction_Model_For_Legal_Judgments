Khan, Advocate.

State (by): Mian Arshad Jan, AAG.

Complainant (by): Mr. Altaf Knan, Advocate.
LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through this
judgment we shall also decide the Cr. R
No.159-P/2014 and Cr. R No.33-P/2015 as
all the three matters have emanated from
same judgment dated 01.12.2014 of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-ll, Swabi
delivered in case FIR No.964 dated
03.11.2012 u/ss 302/34 PPC registered at
Police Station Topi, District Swabi, whereby,
the appellant has been convicted u/s 302 (b)
PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life
as ta’zir with payment of Rs.5,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of the
deceased or in default whereof to further
suffer six months simple imprisonment.
Benefit u/s 382-B Cr. P.C has been

extended to the appellant.
2. Appellant has impugned his
conviction while the complainant and the
State have filed their separate revisions for

enhancement of the sentence.

3. Brief facts of the case are that on
03.11.2012, complainant Ajmal Khan (PW-7)
reported to SI Islam Khan (PW-10) to the
effect that after parking datsun at Bilal Hotel,
he and alongwith his brother Fazal Hussain
were returning home and when reached at
the place of occurrence, there the appellant
and absconding accused Rawaiz Khan
emerged who opened firing at his brother
with which he was hit and died on the spot.
The occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by one Attaullah. Motive for the occurrence
as given was that the deceased being the
head of local ‘/slah? committee would
reprimand the accused and others for their

wrong doing on which the accused were not

happy.

4. After arrest of the appellant and
completion of investigation, complete
challan was put in Court, where the
appellant was indicted for the crime to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In

order to prove its case, prosecution
examined 11 witnesses, — whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded,
wherein, he professed innocence. The
learned trial Court, after conclusion of the
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge
and while’ recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above, hence

the instant appeal.

5. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
6. Perusal of the case record would

show that in support of the charge against
the appellant, complainant Ajmal Khan
appeared before the learned trial Court as
PW-7 while Attaullah deposed as PW-8. No
doubt, both the witnesses have testified
quite in line with what has been alleged in
the case murasila which is Ex. PA/1 but
noticeable aspect of the case is that the
complainant is a shopkeeper by profession
while eyewitness Attaullah is a mason
hailing from Topi i.e. a village other than the
one where the occurrence had taken place.
As both the witnesses are closely relate to
the deceased, therefore, we will appreciate

their evidence with utmost care and caution
so as to see whether they have given a true

picture of the account or not.

7. In the context of the above, first we
take up the testimony of PW-7. Though this
witness has testified that at the time of
occurrence, he was present with the
deceased when he was fired at but record
shows that he was a chance witness. A
chance witness is one who should not
normally be where and when he claims to
have been and it is now well settled that
testimony of a chance witness, being
interested in the victim, cannot be
considered as credit worthy unless he gives
full justification for his presence on the spot.
According to the evidence, complainant was
running a shop in his village. He has
deposed that on the day of occurrence, he
accompanied the deceased from village
Topi and after parking their datsun, they
were returning home when the deceased
was targeted. Normally the complainant,
being a shopkeeper in village Gala, was
supposed to be either in his shop or village.
He has not given the purpose of his going to
village Topi with his deceased brother.

When the very purpose of going to Topi with
the deceased has not been given by the
complainant then coming of both the
brothers together at the time of occurrence
seems to be doubtful, hence his evidence
cannot be accepted. Likewise, PW-7
Attaullah too is a chance witness who has
not proved his presence on the spot through
any reliable evidence. As stated earlier, he
is mason by profession hailing from another
village quite away from Gala and as per his
testimony on the day of occurrence; he was
working in the house of complainant. He has
deposed in his examination-in-chief that on
the night of occurrence, he was in the
complainant's house and when the
deceased and the complainant got late, he
was asked by their father to go and enquire
about them. According to his deposition,
when he reached near the house of Mian
Khan, there the appellant and_ the
absconding accused were present and when
his nephews reached the spot, there both
the accused opened firing with which Fazal

Hussain was hit and died on the spot.

8. Though PW-8 has tried to justify his
presence in the house of the complainant for

raising construction for him but the
investigating officer did not collect any
material to show that he had raised any
construction for the complainant in his house,
therefore, his presence on the spot cannot
be accepted for want of any reasonable

justification from him over there.

9. In addition, conduct of both the
eyewitnesses at the time of occurrence
appears to be unnatural one. It is in the
evidence of PW-7 that the dead body was
lying on the spot for 20/25 minutes
whereafter it was removed therefrom. Had
both the eyewitnesses been present on the
spot when the deceased was gunned down
then they would lift the dead body from the
spot immediately, so as to take it to the
hospital or the police station. Letting the
dead body lying on the spot for 20/25
minutes indicates that both the PWs were
not present on the spot when the occurrence

had taken place.

10. Furthermore, PW-8 has deposed that
when after the occurrence people came to
the spot then someone was sent for
arranging a vehicle and when the vehicle
reached the spot then the dead body was

put in it. Ibid part of the testimony of PW-8, if
accepted to be true then it would negate the
version of the complainant that after parking
their vehicle at Bilal Hotel, he and the
deceased left for their house. When
personal vehicle of the complainant was
available near to the spot then waiting for
the people on the spot and on their coming
sending someone for getting a vehicle in
order to take the deceased to hospital etc

does not appeal to mind.

11. Besides, the occurrence had taken
place at 19.20 hours on 03.11.2012 when at
that time there was quite dark. Keeping in
view the distance shown in between the
eyewitnesses, the accused and the bulb,
there was no chance for the eyewitnesses to
properly identify the accused. No doubt, in
the site plan (Ex. PB) a bulb has been
shown letting at point ‘A’ but as this fact was
not mentioned in the murasila (Ex. PA/1),
therefore, no reliance could be placed on
citing of the bulb in the site plan. The
addition seems to be an_ afterthought

attempt to strengthen the prosecution case.

12. Another important aspect of the case
is that all the injuries sustained by the

deceased are of the same dimension which
shows that one weapon of offence was used
in commission of the offence. This fact
shows that taking life of the deceased was
the job of one man for which two persons
have been charged which aspect of the case
has caused dent in the prosecution’s case

as to its accuracy.

13. | Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the accused beyond any shadow of doubts.
It has been held umpteenth times by the
superior Courts that in order to record
conviction of an accused, the prosecution
has to prove its case through consistent,
reliable and confidence inspiring evidence,

which is not the case in hand.

14. For what has been discussed above,
we accept the instant appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment and resultantly acquit
the appellant of the charge leveled against
him. He be set free, if not required to be

detained in any other case.

15. As we have accepted the appeal
against conviction and sentence, therefore,
both the criminal revisions have become

infructuous, hence, dismissed as such.
16. Above are the reasons of our short

order of even date, which reads as under:

“For the reasons to be recorded
later, this appeal is allowed,
conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-ll, Swabi
vide impugned judgment dated
01.12.2014 in case FIR No.964
dated 03.11.2012 u/ss 302/34 PPC
of Police Station Topi District Swabi
are set aside. He is acquitted of the
charge leveled against him and be
set free forthwith if not required to

be detained in any other case”.
