2. The succinct facts of the prosecution case are that

on 25.12.2016 complainant Tahir Khan SI in injured

condition at Casualty LRH, Peshawar, at 20:35 hours

reported the matter to the police to the effect that he,

alongwith Arshad, Meena Dar and Adnan constables

were on routine patrol; that when they reached Tarnab

Farm, there a Suzuki Pickup bering registration No.B-

9388-Mardan was parked and near to the Suzuki Sahib

Shah son of Akram Shah (convict-appellant) alongwith
two unknown accused duly armed with firearms were
standing; that he alongwith police party were moving to
arrest them, Sahib Shah forbade them from coming
closer to them and in the meanwhile all the three accused
started firing at the police party, as a result of which he
(complainant) got hit and sustained injury on his right
shoulder; that the police party also retaliated; that due to
firing of the accused, their Suzuki pickup also got
damaged and dog in the said vehicle also received fire
shots and as a result of which died; that the accused
while continuing the firing fled away from the spot.
Report of the complainant was reduced into writing in
the shape of murasila (EX PA/1), the injury sheet of the
injured-complainant was prepared and referred him to
the doctor for examination and treatment. The murasila
was sent to the police station for registration of case FIR
against the accused. Later on, the complainant nominated

the unknown two accused as Zahid and Saad. Later on,
accused Zahid Ali, Sahib Shah, and Saad were arrested
in the case and were thoroughly interrogated in the case.
3. After completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted against them before the competent Court.
Formal charge against them was framed, to which they
did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in support of its case, examined as
many as eighteen (18) witnesses. On conclusion of trial
and hearing arguments, vide judgment dated 29.09.2022
convict-appellant Sahib Shah was convicted and
sentenced and; he being aggrieved of the judgment of the
learned trial Court has filed this Cr. Appeal before this
Court. However, co-accused namely Saad and Zahid Ali
were acquitted of the charges while absconding co-
accused Kamran alias Phalawan was declared proclaimed
offender and perpetual warrant of arrest was issued

against him.
5. We have heard arguments of the learned counsel
for the parties and gone through the evidence with their
valuable assistance.

6. Case of the prosecution is that the occurrence in
this case had taken place at 19:40 hours i.e 07:40 p.m in
the territorial jurisdiction of Police Station, Chamkani,
while the sunset time in this area is almost 05:08 hours,
which is after about two hours and thirty minutes of the
sunset time, meaning thereby that the occurrence had
taken place at nocturnal hours and no source of
identification has been given by the complainant in his
report and Court statement. Even in the site plan (EX
PB), no source of light has been shown by the I.O nor
has been taken into possession from the place of
occurrence. We have to see as to whether the time given
by the complainant in the murasila coincides with the

facts and circumstances of the present case or not.
7. From the contents of the FIR, it is imminently clear
that when the complainant spotted the persons and he
was trying to apprehend them, the appellant warned him
that not to come close to them and thereafter the
occurrence had taken place. This is a case, where the
identification of the appellant has been made through
voice, which is the most week type of evidence. More so,
when the complainant is a police officer posted there and
as per record he has once arrested the accused in some
case under the arms Act, it is very difficult to rely on
such a suspect evidence without strong and independent
corroboration. In addition to that initially three persons
ie the appellant by name and later on the acquitted co-
accused namely Zahid and Saad were charged while
during the course of investigation the absconding co-
accused namely Kamran was nominated as accused in
the case. It is also pertinent to mention here that the

complainant sustained a single injury on his shoulder for
which initially three persons were charged and
subsequently the absconding co-accused namely Kamran
was also nominated in the case, therefore, it is very
difficult to believe the version of the complainant in the
present scenario and overall attending circumstances of
the case. In absence of any evidence regarding source of
light at that time, we are left only with identification by
voice which is always considered to be a week type of
evidence and by itself is not sufficient for awarding
capital punishment to an accused in the circumstances of
the case. Reliance is place upon the judgment rendered in
case titled “Ahmad Sher and another V/s. State” (PLJ

1995 FSC 109), wherein it has been held that:-

“19. Identification by voice i.e where the witnesses had
not seen the face of the accused because the accused had
muffled his face or on account of darkness but had
heard the voice of the accused. Identification of an
accused on the basis of voice has been considered to be a
weak piece of evidence”.

In the case titled “The State V4. Fazal Ahmad

and another” (1970 PCr.LJ 633 [Peshawar]) it was

observed that:-
“10. Further, it was argued that the respondents had
talked and they could have been identified by their
voice. We are also not impressed with this argument for
the reason that identification by voice has always been
held doubtful by the superior Courts”.

In another judgment in the case “Hamzo and 2

others V/s. The State” (1972 PCr.LJ 478 [Karachi])

it was held that:

“We are quite clear in our mind that this witness
according to his own statement first was not sure about
the clear visibility of moon light, sufficient to identify the
appellants because he says that there were some clouds
also and the moon light was dim. Secondly he is not very
sure about the identification of the appellants because he
states that he identified the accused on voice also and
that first he suspected them on the light of moon and
later on he became sure about the identity of the accused
when they gave hakals to us. Therefore, no value can be
attached to the statement of this witness whose
identification appears to be only that on voice. The
identification on voice is a very weak piece of evidence
and it has been repeatedly held that without other
strong circumstantial evidence an accused cannot be
held guilty on the ground of having been identified by
voice, therefore, we do not attach any value to the
statement of this witness”.

We would also refer the judgment of Lahore
High Court in the case titled “Abdul Rashid and 3
others V/s. The State” (1973 PCr.LJ 428 [Lahore])

wherein similar view was followed;

“In fact she had stayed in the courtyard for only a few
seconds after the arrival of the accused as she
immediately slipped outside to inform Abdul Ghafoor
about it and remained outside due to fear till their
escape from the Haveli as stated by her during the cross-
examination. She could thus have no more than a casual
glace on the accused and could not have identified all of
them in the hurry and worry of this moment. In view of
her admission that she had not seen Imam Ali and
Ziladar accused since her childhood she could not be so
familiar with their voice as to be able to recognize either
of them. Her claim that she had identified these two
assailants from their voice was apparently incredible. It
would therefore be unsafe to rely on her testimony with
regard to the participation of these two accused in this
oceurrence”.

Similar view was taken by High Court of Sindh
in the case of “Misri_and 03 others V/s. The State”

(PLJ 1984 Cr.C (Karachi) 327) by holding that:-

“In addition to this, identification of appellant Misri as
person, who called the deceased, on the basis of voice, is
also doubtful and cannot be relied upon”.

8. In the present case, since no other source of
identification of the appellant has been established
through any evidence except the version of the
complainant that once he has arrested the accused in
some case under the Arms and identified the appellant
by voice, therefore, in light of the above referred
judgments, the alleged identification of the appellant
by the complainant through his voice is doubtful and
being a weak type of evidence, cannot be used for

conviction of the appellant.

9. The learned AAG argued that after the arrest of the
appellant, he was also duly identified by the complainant
in a test identification parade conducted by Miss. Saima
Irfan, Judicial Magistrate, Peshawar, vide identification

report (EX PW 15/2). However, to prove the same the
10

prosecution examined Tariq Mehmood, Stenographer as
(PW-15) and he deposed that the proceedings were
conducted by the said Judicial Officer. This witness in
his cross examination stated that the said Judicial Officer
is alive. It is also pertinent to mention here that when the
complainant in his initial report i.e murasila (EX PA/1)
has already named the appellant, then there was no need
of test identification parade and the manner the same is
exhibited is also not permissible by law. So the
identification parade has also got no legal value in the
facts and circumstances of the case.

The learned AAG also referred to certain portion of
cross examination and admitted that the same are
admission on the part of the defence and also submitted
that so many things have been clarified by the defence
during the course of their cross examination. The
objection of the learned AAG is not sustainable for the

reason that admission in criminal case are not having
ll

binding effect on the client and in this regard reliance is
placed on the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled “Abdul Khaliq..vs..The
State” reported as (1996 SCMR-1553). It is also well
settled that the prosecution has to establish its case on its
own evidence and could not take advantage of the
weaknesses of the defence.

10. During the spot inspection, the 1.0 recovered two
empties of 30 bore and 41 empties of 7.62 bore, which
were sent to the FSL for ascertaining as to whether these
were fired from one weapon or more than one weapon.
As per FSL report (EX PW 14/12) the two 30 bore
empties were reported to have been fired from one and
the same 30 bore weapon while the empties of 7.62 bore
were fired from different 7.62 mm bore weapons, but, the
complainant in his initial report i.e murasila (EX PA/1)
has mentioned that the accused were armed with “Aslaha

Atasheen” and has not mentioned the caliber of weapons
~

12

which the accused were possessing. It is also pertinent to
mention here that the complained sustained a single
firearm injury on his shoulder, for which no specific role
was attributed to any of the accused.

11. Besides the above, the appellant after his arrest in
the instant case, on his pointation the I.O recovered the
Kalashnikov with fixed charger containing 08 live
rounds and took into possession vide memo (EX PW
11/2) in presence of its marginal witnesses. Muhammad
Yousaf Shah SI (PW-11) who is marginal witness to the
recovery memo, in his cross examination stated that; “It
is correct that the place of occurrence was already
visited by us. ......... 1 do not know as to the provision of
161 Cr. PC. My statement was not recorded by the LO
u/s-161 Cr. PC.” The ILO (PW-14) in his cross
examination stated that; “Jt is correct that I have not
recorded statement of any independent witness

ascertaining the house in question. ..... As per sketch EX
13

PW 14/5 recovery of KK was not shown from the room of
accused facing trial Sahib Shah........ It is correct that
KKs are easily available in open markets.” No person
from the locality was associated with the recovery
proceedings, but, mere recovery of Kalashnikov is of no

good for prosecution.

12. Keeping in view the above discussion the

prosecution has not been able to bring home charge
beyond reasonable shadow of doubt with particular
reference to the appellant, possibility of his false
implication cannot be ruled out. He, therefore, deserves
to get the benefit of doubt in the attending circumstances
of the case. By now it is settled principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof must accrue in favour
of the accused as matter of right and not of grace. For
giving the benefit of doubt, it was not necessary that
there should be many circumstances creating doubts. If

there is circumstance which created reasonable doubt in a
14

prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused would be entitled to the benefit of doubt not as a

matter of grace and concession but as a matter of right.

13. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we
accept this Criminal Appeal, set aside the impugned
judgment dated 29.09.2022 passed by the learned trial
Court, and acquit the appellant of the charges leveled
against him. He be released forthwith, if not required in

any other case.
