section 13-KP CNSA & 15-AA while extending

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant
Rehman Sher Khan SI alongwith other police officials

were present on routine patrolling and received spy
information that one Hassan Shah alias Chaudhry
alongwith other companions are engaged in supply of
ICE and heroin to youngsterf Upon the information
they raided upon Adda of Hassan Shah and on seeing
the police party, accused tried to decamp from the
spot, however, all the persons were overpowered. On
cursory interrogation one of the accused disclosed his
name as Hassan Shah alias Chaudhry who was
carrying a shopping bag. On search of the same 01
packet ICE and 01 packet heroin were recovered, on
weighment it came out 1100 and 1300 grams
respectively. Moreover, on his personal search ICE
was recovered from his side pocket, on weighment it
came out 200 grams. Similarly, the other accused
disclosed his name as Arif Ullah, who was carrying a
shopping bag, upon search 01 packet ICE was
recovered, one weighment it came out 1050 grams,
upon his personal search 200 tokens ICE were
recovered from his side pocket, on weighment it came
out 100 grams ICE. The third person disclosed his
name as Hakeem Khan, from his possession one pistol
alongwith 05 live rounds and 150 tokens ICE were

recovered, on weighment it came out 150 grams. The
seizing officer also took into possession, one mixture,
one digital scale and three motorbikes from the spot.
The representative samples separated from the
recovered stuff, sealed into separate parcels, while
remaining contrabands were sealed into parcels by
affixing “HM” monogram. The seizing officer
prepared the recovery memo Ex.PW4/1. The
complainant prepared murasila Ex.PW4/4 and sent the
same to the Police Station through Constable Bakht
Munir for registration of the case, on the basis whereof
FIR Ex.PA was registered.

3. After completion of investigation the
prosecution submitted complete challan against the
accused. The accused was summoned, who were
produced in custody and the provisions of section 265-
C Cr.P.C were complied with. Formal charge against
the accused was framed to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial.

4. During trial, the prosecution examined as
many as Six (06) witnesses. Statement of the accused
was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he
neither wished to be examined on oath nor desired to

produce evidence in his defence. After hearing learned
counsel for the accused and learned Dy.PP for the
State, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge
Special Court, District Khyber, rendered the impugned
judgment dated 31.10.2022, thereby, convicting the
accused/appellant as mentioned in the first paragraph
of the judgment.

5. Hence, the instant Criminal Appeal (No.1123-
P/2022) by convict/appellant, namely, Hassan Shah
alias Chaudhry and Arif Ullah and connected Criminal
Appeal (No.1147-P/2022) by convict/appellant, namely,
Hakeem Khan, for their acquittal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the appellants
and learned AAG heard; and record perused.

7. In this case as referred above the complainant
alongwith other police officials were on routine patrol
of the area and received information that the appellants
are busy in selling of narcotic in their den situated in
village Sam Gara. Pursuant to information, they
raided the said place and the accused-appellants were
arrested while they were trying to flee from the spot
(place of occurrence) and the contraband narcotics
mentioned above were recovered from their

possession. It is a matter of record that the place of
occurrence is not a dwelling house rather the same was
being used as main supply center of narcotic. The
complainant and the other PWs have withstood the test
of cross examination and their testimony has remained
un-shattered and un-rebutted. The contention of the
learned counsel for the appellants that the place of
occurrence was raided in violation of section 103
Cr.P.C and warrant under section 27 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic substances, Act,
2019, was not obtained in this respect from the
competent Court of law. Section 31 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019, is reproduced for convenience.

Section 31. Mode of making searches and arrest.----

“The provisions of the Code, except those of section
103, shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to all searches and
arrests”

Provided that section 103 of Code shall, in case -

of search of dwelling house, be strictly observed.

In the above mentioned section it is
specifically mentioned that the provision of section
103 Cr.P.C are to be strictly complied with only in
case of dwelling house. There is nothing on record to
show that the place of occurrence was a dwelling

house rather the same as per prosecution was the den of
narcotic. The term “dwelling house” has neither been
defined in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 2019, nor in the control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. For the purpose,
reference could be made to Black’s Law Dictionary
wherein it has been defined as;

“The house or other structure in which person

lives; a residence or abode”

(Black’s Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition)
In London Building Act, 1930, the same has been
defined as;

“Section.5: Dwelling-house. Means a building
used or constructed or adapted to be used wholly

or principally for human habitation”

In case Lewin v End, [1906] AC 299, at p. 304 Lord
Atkinson remarked that;

“By a ‘dwelling-house’ I understand a house in
which people actually live or which is physically

capable of being used for human habitation”

Bare perusal of the above definitions transpire
that term ‘dwelling-house’ refers to a place or building
which is actually and principally used for human
residence. Admittedly (admitted by convict/appellants
in their statements under section 342 Cr.P.C), the place

of occurrence was an Adda (Den) not a dwelling-
house. Therefore, non-compliance of the provision of
section 103 Cr.P.C would not vitiate the recovery
proceedings.

8. Regarding the second objection of the learned
counsel for the appellants that warrant u/s 27 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 2019, was not obtained. It is pertinent to mention
here that the information was received to the police
while they were on routine patrol and thereafter they
straightaway rushed to the place of occurrence. At
times law enforcing agencies are left with no choice
but to conduct raid for the reason that any sort of delay
would give time to the culprits to leave the place of
occurrence or to dispose of the incriminating articles.
Therefore, in the present situation the raid has been
conducted according to law by considering the facts
and circumstances of the case. In addition to above,
the provision of section 27 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances, Ac,
2019, and that of the provisions of section 20 & 21 of
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, are almost
identical to each other and it has been held by the

Apex Court in four-member bench judgment rendered
in case titled “Zafar..Vs..The State” (2008 SCMR
1254)” that these are directory and not mandatory.
Furthermore, Section 28 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019, subject to
proviso of sub-section 1 of Section 27, empowers
authorize officer to enter any building, place, premises,
dwelling house or conveyance on receipt of
information or knowledge, if he is of the opinion that
narcotic substances is kept or concealed, and obtaining
search or arrest warrant from the Special Court will
give opportunity for concealment of evidence or
facility for escape to any person involved in
commission of offence. Compliance of proviso of sub-
section 1 of Section 27 is also not attracted in the
present case. The rationale behind the compliance of
the proviso is to preserve privacy and maintain dignity
and modesty of women and dwelling house. So the
raiding police party acted within the four corners of
law. Therefore, in view of this Court the proceedings
in question cannot be declared void due to non
observance of section 27 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019.

9. It is evident from record that the prosecution has
produced material evidence regarding the recovery of
contraband ICE and heroin from the possession of the
appellants. The seizing officer has appeared as PW-4
whereas one of marginal witness to the recovery memo
has appeared as PW-5. PW-2 Moharrir handed over the
samples to PW-1, who took the same to FSL for
chemical analysis. The FSL report Ex.PZ in respect of
the said samples is in positive. It is pertinent to mention
that the recovery was effected on 10.08.2021 while the
samples were received in the FSL on 11.08.2021 on the
very next date of the recovery, therefore, possibility of
tempering or manipulation is ruled out. Complainant
(PW-4) has stated that he has himself brought the
samples of the contraband narcotics to the Police Station
and the same were handed over to Tahir Khan Moharrir
(PW-2) and the Moharrir has handed over to Constable
Abid Ullah (PW-1) for onward transmission to the FSL.
Thus, the prosecution in view of this Court was able to
establish the recovery of contraband from possession of
the appellants. Furthermore, the safe custody and
transmission of the samples right from the place of

recovery to FSL was also established. Hence the
conviction of the appellants by the trial Court vide
impugned judgment is not open to any exception.

10. Moving on to the quantum of sentence awarded
to the appellants. The appellants are first offenders and
there is nothing on record that they are previously
involved in such like cases. There are certain
shortcomings and negligible inconsistencies in the
evidence which in view of this Court will have bearing
on the quantum of sentence only and not on the guilt of
the appellants, therefore, conviction of the appellant,
namely, Hassan Shah, ws 9-D of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019,
is maintained, however, his conviction and sentence
under section 11-C of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 2019, is reduced from
Fourteen (14) years RI to Ten (10) years rigorous
imprisonment while the fine amount is maintained under
both heads, however, in default of payment of fine he
shall further undergo One (01) month SI each head
instead of Six (06) months SI. Similarly, the conviction
and sentence of appellant, namely, Arif Ullah, under
section 11-C of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of

Narcotic Substances Act, 2019, is also reduced from
Fourteen (14) years RI to Ten (10) years RI while the
fine amount is maintained, however, in default of
payment of fine he shall further undergo One (01)
month SI instead of Six (06) months SI.

11. Likewise, from possession of accused Hakeem
Khan 150 sachets/tokens weighing 150 grams ICE were
recovered. It is not clear that whether sachets/tokens
recovered from the possession of accused-appellant
Hakeem Khan were weighed with the sachets/bags or
otherwise and the quantity allegedly recovered from his
possession is also a borderline between 11-A and 11-B
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances,
Act, 2019. In the circumstances, appellant, namely,
Hakeem Khan, is given benefit of doubt in quantum of
sentence and his conviction is altered from 11-B to 11-A
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic
Substances, Act, 2019, and his sentence is reduced from
Ten (10) years RI to Three (03) years RI while the fine
amount is maintained, however, in default of payment of
fine he shall further undergo One (01) month SI instead

of Six (06) months SI.
12. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is also extended
to the convicts/appellants. All the substantive sentences
awarded the convicts-appellants shall run concurrently.
13. In view of the above, this Criminal Appeal
(No.1123-P/2022) and the connected Criminal Appeal
(No.1147-P/2022) are partially allowed in the above
terms.

Announced.
