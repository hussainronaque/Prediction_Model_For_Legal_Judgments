IJAZ ANWAR, J. Through the instant petition under S.
561-A Cr.PC, the petitioner seeks quashment of the
proceedings, initiated by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Lahor, District Swabi, on the application of
respondent No.3 for the recovery of compensation
payable to him by the petitioner under S. 544-A Cr.PC as
per the verdict of the learned trial Court dated 07.10.2021
rendered in his complaint under Sections 3/4/6/7 of the
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005, upheld by this Court
while deciding Cr. A 893-P/2021 on 24.01.2022, as well
as by the august Apex Court in Criminal Petition

No.199 of 2022, vide judgment & order dated 10.6.2022.
2. After final verdict of the august Apex Court, the

respondent applied the learned trial Court for the
recovery of compensation under S. 544-A Cr.PC,
wherein proceedings were initiated; however, the
petitioner, being aggrieved of the same, has filed the
instant quashment petition, on the grounds, inter alia, that
after final judgment, the learned trial Court has become

fuctus officio and cannot execute its own order.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. A perusal of the record would reveal that the
learned trial Court while deciding the complaint of the
respondent on 07.10.2021, convicted the petitioner under
S. 3(2) of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 and
sentenced to undergo ten (10) years imprisonment (RI)
with fine of Rs.1,00,000/-, and in default of payment of
fine to undergo six (06) months SI; besides, he was fined
Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation payable to the
respondent under S. 544-A Cr.PC for the agonies and
anguishes sustained due to unlawful act of the petitioner.
As against that, this Court dismissed the appeal of the
petitioner on 24.01.2022 and maintained the judgment of
the learned trial Court, while the august Apex Court

partially allowed Criminal Petition No.199 of 2022 of

the petitioner on 10.6.2022 only to the extent of reduction
in the sentence from ten years rigorous imprisonment to
three years rigorous imprisonment while maintaining his

conviction, and the rest of fine etc, remained intact.

5. It is pertinent to mention here that payment of
rupees one million compensation under S. 544-A Cr.PC
as ordered by the learned trial Court was maintained upto
the august Apex Court. The learned trial Court, however,
on the application of the complainant proceeded with the
execution of the order for the recovery of said
compensation and issued orders for the attachment of

petitioner/convict’s property.

6. The compensation payable under S. 544-A Cr.PC
is recoverable as an arrears of land revenue; S. 544-A
sub-section (2) being relevant is reproduced as under for

the sake of convenience;

[544-A, Compensation to the heirs of the person
killed, etc. [(1) Whenever a person is convicted of
an offence in the commission whereof the death of
or hurt, injury, or mental anguish or psychological
damage to, any person is caused or damage to or
loss or destruction of any property is caused, the
court shall when convicting such person, unless for
reasons to be recorded in writing it otherwise
directs, order the person convicted to pay to the

heirs of the person whose death has been caused,

or to the person hurt or injured, or to the person to
whom mental anguish or psychological damage
has been caused, or to the owner of the property
damaged, lost or destroyed, as the case may be,
such compensation as the court may determine
having regard to the circumstances of the case’; ]

and

(2) The compensation payable under sub-section
(1) shall be recoverable as [an arrear of land
revenue] and the court may further order that, in
default of payment or of recovery as aforesaid the
person ordered to pay such compensation shall
suffer imprisonment for a period not exceeding six
months, or if it be a Court of the Magistrate of the
third class, for a period not exceeding thirty days.

7

From bare reading of the afore-said provision of law, it
is clear that the amount of compensation is to be
recovered as an arrears of land revenue in accordance
with the provisions of the Land Revenue Act, 1967.
Section 80 of this Act provides for the mode and manner
in which the recovery of arrears is to be made, it being

relevant is reproduced as under;

80. Subject to the other provisions of this Act, an
arrear of land-revenue may be recovered by any

one or more of the following processes namely: -

(a) by service of a notice of demand on the

defaulter under section 81;
(b) by arrest and detention of his person under

section 82;

(c) by districts and sale of his movable property

and uncut or ungathered crops under section 83,

(d) by transfer, under section 84, of the holding in

respect of which the arrear is due;

(e) by attachment, under section 85, of the holding

in respect of which the arrear is due;

() by annulment, under section 86, of the
assessment of that holding;

(g) by sale of that holding under section 88;

(h) by proceedings against other immovable

property of the defaulter under section 90.”
It is further clarified that under S. 81 of the ibid Act, such
process is to be initiated by the revenue officer on or after
the day following that on which an arrear of land revenue
accrues; thereafter, the whole mechanism from arrest and
detention under S. 82, if arrears are not paid to proceed
against his movable and immovable property under S. 90
of the Act for the recovery of arrears would follow. Thus,
in the whole process, the trial Court ordering for
compensation under S. 544-A Cr.PC does not picture
anywhere. Admittedly, the compensation so granted is
not an arrears of land revenue, however, the only mode
for the recovery of land arrears as provided under the

Land Revenue Act, 1967 is to follow and therefore, when

once conviction and sentence has been handed down by
the learned trial Court, it has got no such powers left to
act as an executing Court for the recovery of

compensation.

7. In this view of the matter, this quashment petition
is allowed, the proceedings before the learned trial are
quashed, and the respondent complainant is at liberty to

submit his petition before the quarter concerned for the

recovery of compensation amount in accord with
law. }
