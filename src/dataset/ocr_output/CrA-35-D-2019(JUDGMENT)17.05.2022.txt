MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALL, J.— The appellant has
assailed the judgment dated 17.09.2018, passed by the
Assistant Commissioner/ADM, Wana, South Waziristan
Tribal District, whereby convict/ appellant Riaz Muhammad
son of Din Muhammad alias Din Bobrai, nominated for the
murder of Abdullah son of Hazrat Khan, was convicted under
Section 302 PPC read with Section 16 of FIGR-2018 by the

Assistant Commissioner/ADM Wana invoking powers under
Section 7 of the FATA Interim Governance Regulations,
2018, and sentenced to twenty-five (25) years rigorous

imprisonment.

2. Summarized facts of the case are that the complainant
Hafiz Hazrat Umar son of Hazratullah Yar Gul Khel, made a
report to the political administration of Wana, District South
Waziristan, to the effect that the accused Riaz Gul on
23.05.2018 at about 06:00 PM murdered his brother
Abdullah by making firing at him. The motive of occurrence
was on the sale/exchange of motorcycle and cell phone. After
the occurrence, the accused was arrested and he recorded his
statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. wherein he confessed
his guilt. Finally, the Assistant Commissioner/ADM Wana,
vide impugned Order dated 17.09.2018, in view of the
confessional statement of accused/appellant, convicted him
under Section 302 PPC read with section 16 of FIGR-2018,
and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment of
twenty-five years. Aggrieved of his conviction & sentence,
the petitioner filed present jail appeal with an application to

condone the delay in filing the appeal.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties assisted
by learned Addl: A.G representing the State heard and record

gone through with their valuable assistance.
4. It is the case of prosecution that the accused executed
the brother of complainant by making firing with the
Kalashnikov; and after his arrest, the accused recorded his
confessional statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. therefore,
he was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for twenty-five
years. Learned counsel for the appellant mainly argued that
the conviction & sentence so awarded to the accused is illegal
as, after the merger of FATA into province Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, the Assistant Commissioner/ADM was
having no jurisdiction to try criminal cases thus, the
impugned order being void, limitation is condonable. The
learned AAG assisted by learned counsel for complainant
unanimously argued that the impugned order was passed
under the FATA Interim Governance Regulations, 2018, and
therefore, the impugned conviction is liable to be maintained
particularly when the appeal has been filed beyond the scope
of limitation provided for filing appeals under Section 410

Cr.P.C.

5. Before dilating upon the merits of the appeal, we
would like to discuss the application for the condonation of
delay. Although the law of limitation is the foremost element
for the decision of a case, and in case of failure in complying

with the law of limitation, other merits cannot help the party
who travelled beyond the period of prescribed limitation. But
in criminal cases, particularly, involving conviction of an
accused person, the situation is different and the delay always
remains subservient to the merits of case because, the right
to appeal provided under Sections 410 of the Criminal
Procedure Code against an order of conviction is also the
fundamental right of an accused as enshrined in Article 9 of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The
said Article 9 of the Constitution provides a citizen for
protection of his life and liberty which reads that "no person
shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with

id

law".

6. The term ‘save in accordance with law’ means the
modalities of regulating, restricting or even rejecting a
fundamental right falling within Article 9 of the Constitution
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, have to be fair,
carefully designed to effectuate, not to subvert, the
substantive right itself. In this regard, a fair trial is the first
imperative of the dispensation of justice. Further Article 10
of the Constitution gives safeguard as to arrest and detention
in certain cases. Clauses (1) and (2) of the Article 10 apply
to a person arrested or detained under law otherwise than

preventive detention. Article 9 of Constitution supplements
the various requirements laid down under Article 10 of the
Constitution. Personal liberty cannot be cut out or cut down
without fair legal procedure. Enough has been set out to
establish that a convict, deprived of his freedom, by the
Court’s sentence but entitles to an appeal against such verdict
as part of his protection under Article 9 of the Constitution
and as implied in his statutory right of appeal. It is a fact that
the convict irrespective of any means, are particularly
handicapped class. The morbid cell which confines them to

walls also cut them off from the world outside. Legal

remedies are obtained beyond their physical and even
financial reach. Under the said circumstances denying the
condonation of delay in filing the appeal outrightly will cause
further hardship, inconvenience and the same will be
prejudicial to their interest. A fundamental right by no stretch
of imagination can be taken away by way of technicalities.
Thus, keeping these fundamental and statutory rights of a
convict in mind, we deem it apposite to first discus the merits
of appeal and then to take-up the application for the
condonation of delay for decision, in the peculiar background

of present appeal.

7. Now adverting to the merits of the case and in this

regard the primary contention of the learned counsel for
appellant was that the impugned order was passed after the
25" Constitutional Amendment, therefore, the same is ab-
initio void being unconstitutional. Suffice it to say that
Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2018 was
passed from the National Assembly Pakistan on 24" May,
2018 and thereafter to provide an interim system of
administration of justice, maintenance of peace and good
governance in the FATA, due to repeal of Frontier Crime
Regulation, 1901, the President of Pakistan promulgated
“FATA Interim Governance Regulation, 2018” (FIGR-2018)
which was notified in the official gazette on 29.05.2018. Be
that as it may, this Court in a division bench judgment in
W.P. No.3098-P/2018 vide Judgment dated 30.10.2018
declared the said regulation as ultra vires of the Constitution
to the extent of allowing the Commissioners to act as Judges;
Council of Elders deciding Civil and Criminal matter;
Constitution of Qaumi Jirga; modified applications of
Chapters VIII and XLII of the Code for Security; Third
Schedule; administered area etc and it was held that after one
month from the date of judgment, any decision of civil or
criminal nature would be void ab-initio; and thereby the
target date was set as 30.11.2018. The referred judgment

dated 30.10.2018 was though challenged in Civil Petition
No.773-P/2018 but the same was dismissed as having been
withdrawn, with certain observations by the worthy Apex
Court, vide Judgment dated 31.12.2018 in the case of
“National Commission on Status of Women through
Chairperson and others Vs. Government of Pakistan
through Secretary Law and Justice and others” (PLD 2019
Supreme Court 218) and thereby six months’ time was
given for the development of infrastructure to take steps to
spread a uniform system of Courts of ordinary jurisdiction in
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, mandating the local law enforcing
agencies to ensure that the rule of law is observed by

reducing jirgas/panchayats etc to arbitration forums.

8. In this view of the matter, as aforesaid, after the
judgment dated 30.10.2018 in WP No.3098-P/2018, FIGR-
2018 were effective for all practical purposes from the date
of its promulgation till 30.11.2018. The order impugned in
this appeal was passed on 17.09.2018 even prior to the ibid
judgment of this Court, therefore, completely fall within the
reign of FIGR-2018, and its legality on this score cannot be

questioned.

9. Now the final question for ascertainment before us is,
‘whether the impugned order was passed fully in accordance

with the provisions of FIGR-2018?’ and in this regard we
have noted that the impugned order was passed by the
Assistant Commissioner by exercising powers as Additional
District Magistrate. Regulation 2(f) of the FIGR-2018
recognized an Assistant Commissioner to be a Judge to
adjudicate criminal matters in each tribal district and vested
with the requisite powers under the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898, to try offences. Clauses 3 & 4 of the
Regulation-7 further conferred all the ordinary powers of a
Magistrate of the First Class as specified in Schedule II and
additional powers as specified in Part I of Schedule IV of the
Cr.P.C. upon the Assistant Commissioner to pass any
sentence of imprisonment or fine, or both, as provided by the
Regulation. Further that when exercising powers of a Deputy
Commissioner under the FIGR-2018, an Assistant
Commissioner shall be deemed, for the purpose of
regulation, to be the District Magistrate and shall exercise all
or any of the powers specified in the First Schedule of the
Regulation. Procedure of the trial in criminal case, conviction
and manner of enforcing sentences, have been provided in

Regulations 13, 16 & 17 respectively, which read as under:

13. Criminal Reference to Council of
Elders.- (1) Whenever an offence, of

which the Deputy Commissioner is
competent to take cognizance under this
Regulation, is committed, the case shall be
registered and the accused shall be
produced before the Judge concerned
within twenty four hours of the arrest of the
accused excluding the time necessary for
the journey from the place of arrest to the
Judge having jurisdiction. The Judge shall
make an order in writing referring the
matter to the Council of Elders for its
finding on facts, who after holding
necessary inquiry and hearing the parties
and witnesses, submit its findings to the
Judge. The Judge shall appoint the
members of the Council of Elders within
ten days from the date of arrest of the
accused and shall require the Council of
Elders to submit its findings on the question

referred to within ninety days.

(2) Where reference to the
Council of Elders is made under sub-
section (1) and the members of the Council

have been nominated by the Judge, the
10

names of the members so nominated be
communicated to the accused and the
complainant, and any objection taken
thereto by any of the parties, shall be
recorded. The Judge shall dispose of the
objection after hearing the parties and the
reasons thereof be recoded and appoint the

members of the Council accordingly.

(3) On receipt of finding of the
Council of Elders, the Judge shall decide
the legal issues, if any, and pass an order in
accordance with the findings of the
majority of the Council of Elders and

applicable law.

16. Punishment on conviction.- Where the
Judge convicts a person under sub-section
(3) of Section 13, he may pass sentence of
imprisonment or fine or both for the
offence, provided that the sentence shall

not exceed twenty five years.

17. Manner of enforcing sentences. Any

sentence passed under section 16 shall be
11

executed in the manner provided for the

execution of sentence in Chapter XXVIII

of the Code and:

(a)

(b)

(c)

an offence punishable with
imprisonment for life shall be
punishable with rigorous
imprisonment for a term
which may extend to twenty

five years.

the imprisonment in default of
payment of fine shall be
simple and the provisions of
section 63 to 70 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
(Act XLV of 1860) shall,
subject to aforesaid
provisions, apply to sentences
passed under this Regulation;

and

the sentence of imprisonment
and fine provided by the

Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
12

(Act XLV of 1860) or any
other law specified in the
Second Schedule to this
Regulation for the offence
shall be applicable to such

offence committed in FATA.

10. It is clear from the above extracted provisions of
Regulation 13 that upon commission of any cognizable
offence, falling within the competence of Deputy
Commissioner, the same shall be registered and after arrest
of accused, he shall be produced before the Judge within 24
hours of his arrest, who shall refer the matter to the Council
of Elders for its finding on facts but after holding necessary
inquiry, hearing parties and witnesses; and then the council
of elders shall submit its findings on the fact to the judge and
latter shall record its findings on the legal issues, if any, and
pass order accordingly. This specific provision for hearing
parties and their witnesses by the council of elders before
recording its finding on facts, become more nuanced when
viewed in the constitutional context. Right to life and liberty,
right to fair trial and right to dignity are fundamental rights
guaranteed under Articles 9, 10-A and 14 of the Constitution.

The importance of human life goes to the heart of these
13

fundamental rights, the rigorous two-tiered process of
appraisal, assessment and examination under the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court also meets the test of these
fundamental rights. The duty cast on the Court, or Council of
Elders in the case of FIGR-2018, in deciding a criminal case
entailing punishment of life imprisonment is a heavy one and
can only be discharged once the entire evidence is recorded
and reappraised by the Judge on the legal issues to fully
exhaust all the points, having a bearing upon the guilt or

innocence of an accused person.

11. Admittedly, and undeniably, after the arrest of
appellant/accused, the matter was not referred by the
Assistant Commissioner/Judge to the Council of Elders for
recording its finding on facts after inquiry and hearing parties
and their witnesses. A Judge could pass sentence under
Regulation 16 only after satisfying the mandate of
Regulation 13(3) and that can be done subject to submission
of findings on facts by the Council of Elders. Hence,
provisions of Section 16 are supplemental to Section 13(3)
and cannot be applied in isolation thereto. The sentence can
be enforced under Regulation 17 in the cases where
provisions of Regulation 16 are fulfilled. As discussed

hereinabove, the matter was not referred to the council of
14

elders for recoding its findings on facts and noncompliance
of mandatory provisions of Regulation 13 invalidates the
impugned conviction & sentence by the Assistant
Commissioner/ADM vide order dated 17.09.2018. For this
reason, the impugned conviction and sentence are legally
unwarranted, and this fact brings the appeal of appellant
within the scope of Articles 9, 10-A and 14 of the
Constitution. Accordingly, the delay in filing the appeal is
condoned and we while treating the appeal within time allow
this appeal, set aside the impugned conviction and sentence
awarded to the appellant Riaz Muhammad, vide order dated
17.09.2018, passed by Assistant Commissioner/ADM Wana,
South Waziristan Tribal District and remand his case back
for denovo trial. Here, we deem it in the fitness of things to
clarify that the criminal proceedings against appellant were
initiated within the purview of provisions of FATA Interim
Governance Regulation, 2018, which are deemed to have
been repealed in view of the above referred Judgments of this
Court as well as worthy Apex Court, therefore, this judgment
cannot review the provisions of repealed act as contemplated
under Article 264 of the Constitution of Pakistan, particularly
when a judicial system has been set-up in the erstwhile

FATA and this Court in the Reference/Suo Moto No.01-P of
15

2019 titled “Secretariat, District Judiciary, Peshawar High
Court, Peshawar VS. Provincial Government & others”
decided vide Judgment dated 20.03.2019, has already
resolved the ambiguity of transfer of pending Civil &
Criminal matters from erstwhile political administration to
the newly established Civil, Session and District Courts in

the Tribal Districts in the manner:

“11. in view of the above quoted sections
of law it became very clear that under
section 24 of the CPC & 526 Cr.PC, this
Court has got ample powers to transfer
cases from one Court of law to another,
therefore, summarizing the process of
subject matter pending before the
previous hierarchy, it is held that under
trial cases be transferred to the Court of
Civil Judge/Judicial Magistrate, having
jurisdiction under the law, appeals to the
Court of District & Sessions Judges and
thereafter proceedings excluding past and
closed chapters would be filed before this
Court, as revisional matter. On criminal

side, all pending cases in trial Court
16

irrespective of the same pending before
Additional Commissioner or
Commissioner, but in trial stands
transferred to the respective Court i.e.
Judicial Magistrate or Sessions Judge, as
defined earlier, where the punishment
proposed is more than seven years will be
tried by Session Judge and below would
be Magistrate. Whether the appeals are
pending against conviction of four years
and above, the same would be filed before

this Court.

12. Resultantly, the case is sent back to the prosecution to
submit challan before the learned Sessions Judge South
Waziristan, who shall conduct trial denovo strictly in
accordance with law. As the appellant was arrested on
24.05.2018 and since then he is under the custody, and as,
submission of challan by prosecution and denovo trial by the
learned trial Court would certainly take further time;
therefore, in view of the clause (B) of 3 Proviso of Section
497(1) Cr.P.C. the appellant is directed to be released on bail
subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.10,00,000/-

(ten lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to the
17

satisfaction of learned Sessions Judge South Waziristan

Tribal District.

13. These are the reasons of our short order of even date.

Announced.
