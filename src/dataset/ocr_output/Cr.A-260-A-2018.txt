OE 8 KR

SHAKEEL AHMAD, _J:- The convict-appellant,
Shakeel Ahmad aged about 56/57 years, was tried
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-ll,
Mansehra, under section 302 read with section 337-
F(i) PPC for causing murder of Muhammad Naeem
son of Mehmood aged about 17/18 years and biting
the eyewitness Ali Rehmat (PW-6) on 25" March,
2013 at 17.15 hours in his field near link road at
village Degran in the area of Police Station City,
Mansehra.

2. The learned trial Judge vide judgment dated
27" November, 2018 has convicted the appellant
under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced him to

lakh) to be paid to L.Rs. of the deceased as
compensation in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C, in
default thereof, to undergo further simple

for biting and causing ‘damihah’ to Ali Rehman
(PW-6), he was ordered to pay Rs.5,000/- as

with under section 337-Y PPC. Benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant.

3. The appellant has challenged his conviction
and sentence through the present appeal. Mehmood
(PW-5) on whose report FIR was lodged and being
also the father of the deceased, was also not
satisfied with the sentence awarded by the learned
trial Judge to the convicted accused, he has,
therefore, filed revision petition No.50-A of 2018 for
the enhancement of the sentence awarded to the
accused. We propose to dispose of the appeal and
the revision petition by this single judgment.

4. The prosecution version is based on the
information furnished to complainant Mehmood

and committed his murder by means of firearm.
Pursuant to this information, he alongwith his brother
Ali Rehmat came to the crime scene and found his

investigation challan was submitted against the
appellant by Amjad Hussain Khan SHO on
29.03.2013.

7. Ali Rehmat (PW-6) who is eyewitness of the
occurrence narrated almost the same story as
incorporated in the FIR. In addition to the above,
formal witnesses, namely, Muhammad Saleem, Noor
Islam, Hazrat Bilal, Sherbaz, Ghulam Mustafa,
Zahoor Ahmad, Muhammad Munir and Muhammad
Khushal were also produced. Muhammad Anwar
ASI, Rehmat Wali Constable, Mohiuddin were given
up being unnecessary.

8. The plea of the appellant, as transpires from
his statement under section 342 Cr.P.C is that of
denial simpliciter. He pleaded that he has falsely
been involved in the case and that crime pistol Ex.P-
1 was not recovered at his instance. No evidence,
however, in defence has been led by the appellant.
9. It transpires from the above resume facts of

the case that the prosecution case against the
appellant is based on the statement of PW-5
complainant, ocular account furnished by PW-6,
postmortem report Ex.PW 8/1, inquest report Ex.PW
8/2, medico-legal report of appellant Shakeel Anmad
Ex.PW 10/1, medico-legal report of Ali Rehmat (PW-
6) Ex.PW 12/1, site plan Ex.PW 13/2, recovery of
crime empties Ex.P-5, blood stained earth Ex.P-4,
recovery of crime pistol Ex.P-1 at the pointation of
accused and its matching report Ex.PW 13/3 and
motive.

10. We have heard learned counsel for the
parties at length and examined the record of this
case carefully.

11. The learned counsel representing the
appellant argued that it is an un-witnessed crime.
He next argued that the occurrence has not taken
place in the mode and manner as described by the
prosecution. He further argued that nothing
incriminating article was recovered at the pointation
of the accused. He lastly argued that the prosecution
case is pregnant with doubts against the accused. In
alternative, he argued that this is a case of sudden
provocation and went on to say that the offence, if
any, would fall under section 302(c) PPC and not

under section 302 (b) PPC.
12. Conversely, the learned counsel appearing
on behalf of the complainant and learned AAG
representing the State jointly argued that eyewitness
namely Ali Rehmat fully supported the prosecution
case. They next contended that the crime weapon
was recovered at the pointation of the accused and it
was matched with the crime empties recovered from
the spot which fully connects the accused with the
crime. They further argued that the occurrence took
place in a broad day light which rules out the
possibility of false implication. They added that
recovery of crime empties and blood stained earth
fully established the venue of crime. Regarding
motive they contended that it has been proved.
They lastly argued that the prosecution case is free
from doubt and the accused deserves normal
penalty of death. Adverting to alternative argument
of the learned counsel for the appellant, they
contended that it is not a case of sudden provocation
and that the case does not fall under section 302 (c)
PPC and prayed for dismissal of appeal and
acceptance of revision petition.

13. We have given due consideration to the
submissions, and examined the evidence available

on the record and found that ocular account of the
incident furnished by Ali Rehmat
(PW-6) who is brother of the deceased Muhammad
Naeem, according to him, he and his deceased
brother had taken the goats to the spot for grazing.
His name is mentioned as eyewitness of the
occurrence in the initial report recorded in shape of
Murasila Ex.PW 5/1. His evidence is in consonance
with the probability and materially fits in with the
circumstances of the case. He has stood the test of
cross-examination, but nothing favourable to the
accused could be extracted from his mouth. He has
no previous enmity whatsoever, with the appellant
and there is no material contradictions, discrepancy,
omission or improvement in his statement. No
doubt, he is brother of the deceased but we need not
to say that mere relationship is no ground to
disbelieve his evidence as argued by the learned
counsel for the appellant unless it is proved that he is
inimical and falsely deposed against the appellant
and that he has not seen the occurrence with his
own eyes. He has specifically deposed the reason
of going to the spot with his brother by stating that
both of them had taken their goats to the spot for
grazing. Admittedly, the occurrence took place at

17.15 hours in a broad day light, the accused was
10

previously known to him, which rules out the
possibility of false implication, particularly when there
is no previous enmity between the parties. So far as
the statement of complainant (PW-5) is concerned, it
needs no detailed discussion as his statement is
based on the statement furnished to him by his son,
namely, Ali Rehmat.

14. No doubt, there is a delay of one hour and
forty five minutes in lodging the report. In our view it
is not fatal to the prosecution case. Admittedly, the
occurrence took place in the field of mountainous
area and police station is 3/4 kilometers away from
the place of occurrence. It is an admitted fact that
after the occurrence the eyewitness came to his
father disclosed the incident to him, thereafter, they
came to the spot took the deceased to the hospital,
but on the way to hospital he succumbed to his
injuries and the report was lodged in the Emergency
Ward of KATH. Under these circumstances, some
delay, if any, in lodging the report is of no help to the
accused. Presence of the eyewitness Ali Rehmat
(PW-6) on the spot is also established from the fact
that he sustained teeth bite injury on his right arm
caused by the accused/appellant. Moreso, appellant

also sustained scratches during scuffle, which are
11

reflected from medico-legal report Ex.PW 12/1 and
Ex.PW 10/1, respectively.

15. We do not see any conflict between the
ocular evidence and the medical evidence. The
medical evidence furnishes corroboration to the
ocular account furnished by PW-6 to this extent that
injuries on the body of the deceased was caused by
means of firearm as alleged in the crime report
Ex.PW 5/1 and the eyewitness.

16. So far as recovery of crime pistol Ex.P-1 is
concerned, the recovery admittedly, took place from
the cattle shed of the accused that too at his
pointation on the following day of his arrest i.e.
27.03.2013, which was in exclusive knowledge of the
accused and place of recovery also belonged to him.
It was sent to FSL alongwith crime empties
recovered from the crime scene and its report was
received in positive, which was utilized by
prosecution as a corroborative piece of evidence.

17. Now adverting to plea of sudden provocation
and alternative prayer of the learned counsel for the
appellant regarding his conviction and sentence
under section 302 (c) PPC instead of Section 302(b)
PPC. This argument of the learned counsel for the

appellant equally has no force, because it is evident
12

from the record that the accused came to the spot
duly armed with 30 bore pistol, forbade the deceased
from grazing goats, took out his pistol and fired at the
deceased which hit him.

18. So far as the provocation is concerned, it
consists of mainly on three elements, the act of
provocation, the loss of self-control both actual and
reasonable and the retaliation proportionate to the
provocation. It is further observed that there are five
conditions for bringing the case of an accused within
the ambit of provocation, which are:

(i) the deceased must have given provocation to the
accused,

(ii) The provocation must be grave,

(iii) The provocation must be sudden,

(iv) The offender by reasons of the said provocation
should have been deprived of his power of self-
control and killed the deceased during the
continuance of the deprivation of power of
control,

(v) The offender must have caused, the death of a

person, who gave provocation.

19. In the present case, we have minutely
examined the evidence produced before the learned
trial Court and found that there is nothing on the

record to show that the appellant was provoked. The
13

appellant did not take any such plea in the cross-
examination to the witnesses nor in his statement
recorded under section 342, Cr.P.C. If such plea is
taken, the accused is required under Article 121 of
the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, to have proved
the said plea. If no such proof is led by the accused
then the Court has to presume the absence of such
circumstances. However, if from the facts of the
case, a case of provocation appears to have been
made out then the above conditions are required to
be satisfied before applying the said principle. In this
respect, reference may be made to the most
celebrated judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan, reported as ‘Malik Muhammad Mumtaz
Qadri Vs. The State and others’ (PLD 2016
Supreme Court-17), wherein it was held as

under:-

“.-S. 302 (c), proviso---Qanun-e-Shahadat
(10 of 1984), Art. 121--- Qati-i-amd,
justification for---Grave and sudden
provocation---proof---Where an accused
person wanted the court to believe that
some words or actions of the victim had
provoked him and on the basis of such
provocation he had killed the victim then in
all such cases the court was to presume
the absence f the circumstances being
asserted by the accused person in support
of his plea and it was for the accused
person to prove through positive and
legally admissible evidence that some
provocation was actually offered to him by
the victim and such provocation was grave
and sudden.”
14

From the evidence, it is clear that the appellant
forbade the deceased from grazing goats in the field
and thereafter, he took out his pistol and committed
his murder. There is nothing on the record to suggest
that the action of the deceased or Ali Rehmat PW-6
had provoked the appellant. It is evident from the
record that when PW-6 Ali Rehmat attempted to
intervene and save the Muhammad Naeem (now
deceased) from committing his murder, the appellant
resisted and scuffled with him and caused injury on
his right arm by biting him.

20. As discussed above, neither the deceased
nor the eye-witness did anything which could have
provoked the appellant for killing the deceased. As
such, the appellant had no reason or occasion to kill
the deceased Muhammad Naeem. There is no
possibility of existence of sudden and grave
provocation or self defence at the time of
occurrence.

21. After giving due deliberation and
contemplation, the material available on the record,
we are of the considered opinion that the case of the
appellant falls under section 302(b) PPC and not

under Section 302(c) PPC.
15

22. Adverting to the quantum of sentence, we
observe that there was no background of any
previous enmity between the parties. The incident
took place on a petty matter i.e. grazing of cattle in
the field of the accused, it was not a premeditated
murder. Such factors cumulatively make out a case
for mitigation and under these circumstances the
accused deserves the lesser penalty of the life
imprisonment instead of death.

23. The impugned judgment passed by the
learned trial Court is based on proper appreciation of
evidence and no misreading or non-reading of the
evidence could be pointed out, therefore, the same is
maintained. Resultantly, this appeal fails and is
hereby dismissed. The criminal revision petition filed
by the complainant for enhancement of sentence
awarded to the appellant in the peculiar facts and
circumstances also stands dismissed.

Announced.
