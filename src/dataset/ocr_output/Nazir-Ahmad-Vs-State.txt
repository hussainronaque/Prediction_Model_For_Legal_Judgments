2. According to report of complainant Fazal
Ahmad on 31.12.2013 at 10.00 hours, six persons, four
muffled and two un-muffled, duly armed with pistols,
introducing themselves to be police officials, entered his
house, locked him alongwith other inmates of the house
inside a room and took away Rs.11,00,000/- in cash, 15
tolas gold ornaments and their mobile sets. He disclosed
the descriptions of the two un-muffled culprits in his

than two months, complainant charged the present

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

the commission of offence at the instance alleged
disclosure of co-accused Babar Said.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. The petitioner has been charged after a long
period of one year and two months. In his statement u/s
164 Cr.P.C., he disclosed that co-accused Babar Said was
arrested from whose possession his snatched mobile was
recovered; that accused Babar Said disclosed him that the
recovered mobile was given to him by Nazir Ahmad

dacoity case and is behind the bars at Kot Lakpat Jail
Lahore; that accused Babar Said, showed photograph of
said Nazir Ahamd to the complainant and he identified that
it was accused Said Nazir, who committed theft in his
house alongwith his other companions.

5. No recovery of the alleged stolen articles has
been effected either from the direct or indirect possession
of the petitioner or on his pointation. He has not confessed
his guilt before the competent court of law. Except the
above statement of complainant at the moment there is no
incriminating evidence to connect the petitioner with the
commission of offence. As regard identification parade of
the petitioner, authenticity, credibility and admissibility of

the same is yet to be determined during trial as it has been

conducted after the complainant had already seen the
petitioner in photographs and in police custody. On
tentative assessment of the material available on record,
reasonable grounds exist which make the case of the
petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail.

5. Resultantly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.
