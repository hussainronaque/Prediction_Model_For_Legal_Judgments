2. According to report of complainant-injured
Mst. Bibi Ayesha (PW.10), on the fateful day during
altercation on a petty domestic matter, her husband Faqir
Jan open fire at her with his pistol with the intention to do
her away, as a result, she got hit and injured. She was

4. Shamim Khan SI (PW.13) conducted
investigation in the case. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the pointation of injured
complainant. During spot inspection, he secured blood
with cotton from the place of injured and three crime
empties in presence of marginal witnesses through
recovery memo. He also took into possession the
bloodstained garments of injured through recovery memo,

recorded statements of the PWs and applied for

proceedings under section 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. before the
learned Ilaqa Judicial Magistrate, sent the bloodstained
articles to the FSL report whereof is Exh.PK and on
completion of investigation, handed over the case file to
the SHO, who submitted complete challan against the
accused/appellant.

5. On arrest of the accused/appellant and
completion of investigation supplementary challan was
submitted against him before the learned Trial Court,
where he was formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution led its
evidence and after its closure, statement of the
accused/appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,
wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed his innocence. He, however, declined to be
examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted
and sentenced the accused/appellant as mentioned above,
hence, this appeal.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court is against
the law, facts and evidence on record; that the testimony of

injured complainant Mst. Bibi Ayesha is suffering from

material contradictions and discrepancies creating serious
doubts in the prosecution case, therefore, benefit of the
same was to be extended to the appellant; that medical
evidence also negates the version of injured, therefore,
mere stamp of injuries on her person would not be a
certificate of her truthfulness. He lastly submitted that if
this Court considers the available evidence as sufficient to
prove the guilt of the appellant, then keeping in view the
relationship of appellant as husband of the injured and the
motive as a sudden flare-up on petty domestic affair, his
sentence may be reduced.

7. Injured-complainant Mst. Bibi Ayesha present
stated at the bar that she being poor is unable to engage a
private counsel, therefore, would rely on the arguments of
learned State counsel.

8. Learned State counsel contended that
appellant is directly and singularly charged by her injured
wife Mst. Bibi Ayesha and it does not appeal to a prudent
mind that she will charge her husband by letting off the
real culprit; that injured has furnished the straightforward
and truthful account of the incident and defence failed to
shatter her testimony despite lengthy cross-examination;
that recovery of blood and crime empties from the spot

coupled with medical evidence as well as unexplained

noticeable abscondence of the appellant corroborate the
ocular account of the injured. He while supporting the
impugned judgment sought dismissal of the appeal. He
lastly submitted that keeping in view the brutality of the
appellant as evident from the medical evidence, he deserve
no leniency in punishment.

9. Arguments heard and record perused.

10. In reply to a very first question in his
statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. qua his relation with
injured Mst. Bibi Ayesha, appellant admits her to be his
wife. The incident has taken place in the house of the
complainant/injured situated in village Dheri Baba. The
recovery of blood and three crime empties from the said
house, by the Investigating Officer during spot inspection
coupled with positive Serologist report regarding the blood
secured from the spot and the blood over the garments of
the injured, confirms the crime venue to be the same as
alleged by the injured complainant Mst. Bibi Ayesha.

11. In support of her version, injured Mst. Bibi
Ayesha appeared as PW.10 wherein she reiterated the
same story as set forth by her in her initial report. She has
been subjected to lengthy and searching cross-examination
but nothing beneficial could be extracted from her mouth

by the defence. She remained stuck to her stance and

charged the appellant for commission of the offence. No
doubt there may be certain minor discrepancies in her
statement but such discrepancies being inbuilt proof of
truthfulness of a witness are ignorable because a human
being cannot be expected to furnish a tape-recorded
statement. Those contradictions and discrepancies are
considered fatal which squarely shatter the basic fabric of
the prosecution case, but no such contradictions and
discrepancies have been brought in the statement of injured
witness. She was and is still the wife of the appellant;
therefore, it does not appeal to a prudent mind that she will
charge her innocent husband/appellant by letting off the
real culprit. Medical evidence, recovery of blood and crime
empties from the spot coupled with noticeable
abscondence of the appellant whose wife was lying
seriously injured, fully corroborate the ocular testimony of
injured Mst. Bibi Ayesha and indicate towards the guilty
conscious of the appellant.

12. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution has successfully proved the guilt of the
appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring
evidence beyond shadow of reasonable doubt, therefore,
the learned Trial Court has rightly held him guilty of the

offence to which no exception can be taken.

13. Now the moot question for determination
before me is that what should be the quantum of sentence
to be awarded to the appellant to meet the ends of justice.
The learned Trial Court has awarded the maximum
sentence to the appellant as provided under section 324
PPC i.e. 10 years rigorous imprisonment alongwith fine.
However, keeping in view the motive i.e. sudden flare-up
of the appellant over a petty domestic matter with his wife/
injured, coupled with the fact that their wedlock is still
intact from which they have minor kids, I while taking
lenient view by maintaining the conviction of the appellant
under section 324 PPC, reduce his sentence from ten years
R.I. to 06 years R.I. However, the conviction and sentences
of the appellant under section 337-A (ii) and 337-F (ii)
PPC, alongwith sentence of fine under section 324 PPC,
are maintained. The sentences shall run concurrently and
benefit of S.382-B Cr.P.C. is extended to the appellant.

14. With the above modification in the sentence
of the appellant, this appeal stands dismissed.
