AHMAD ALI, J:- This appeal is directed under
section 417(2-A) Cr.PC against the judgment dated
10.10.2019 passed by learned Sessions Judge,
Torghar at Oghi, whereby, the accused / respondents
were acquitted of the charges leveled against them in
case FIR No. 154 dated 27.08.2011 under sections
324/148/149 PPC Police Station Darband.

2. Brief facts leading to the instant appeal are
that on 27.08.2011 at 14:55 hours, complainant
Muhammad Shiraz, in injured condition lodged a
report to the local police at Emergency Ward Civil
Hospital, Darband, to the effect that he came out of
the ‘Masjid’ after offering ‘Namaz-e-Zohar’, when he

reached near a damaged house of Abdul Hameed,
where Abdul Latif son of Samundar, Muhammad
Ayub son of Samundar, Tanveer son of Khan
Bahadur, Afzal son of Muhammad Yousaf, Dost
Muhammad son of Samundar and Azhar son of Abdul
Latif duly armed with firearms emerged one after the
other and started firing at him, as a result of firing of
Abdul Latif he was hit on his right buttock and
sustained injury, while with the firing of Azhar son of
Abdul Latif, Ayub, Dost Muhammad sons of
Samundar, he sustained injury on his left buttock. The
offence was stated to have witnessed by Haider
Zaman son of Ghulam Qadir, Fida Muhammad son of
Muhammad Yaqoob and Majid son of Khan
Muhammad, who also rescued him. The motive for
the offence was previous criminal litigation. The case
was registered against the said accused in police
station Darband.

3. After completion of investigation, challan was
submitted in the Court of learned Sessions Judge,
Torghar at Oghi for trial. Charge was framed against
the accused/respondents, to which they pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. After completion of trial, the

learned trial Court vide judgment dated 28.11.2015,
accused Abdul Latif was convicted and sentenced to
seven years R.I under section 324 PPC, while under
section 337-F(ii) PPC, he was convicted and
sentenced to two years RI. The remaining
accused/respondents were acquitted of the charges
leveled against them. In Cr. Appeal No.136-A/2016
filed by Abdul Latif, accused/respondent, the said
judgment was set aside by this Court and the case was
remanded to the learned trial Court for denovo trial
vide judgment dated 15.02.2017.

4. In denovo trial, accused/respondents when
formally charged for the offences under sections
148/149/324/337-F(i1) PPC, pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as twelve witnesses.
The accused/respondents were examined under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, they pleaded innocence
and false implication. However, they have not
produced evidence in their defence and also have not
opted to appear as their own witness on Oath as
envisaged under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. The learned
trial Court, after hearing the arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, acquitted all the accused/
respondents including Abdul Latif vide impugned
judgment dated 10.10.2019. Hence, the present
appeal.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
appellant heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of record would reveal that injured
complainant/appellant, Muhammad Shiraz, appeared
before the Court as (PW-6) and furnished ocular
account of the occurrence by reiterating the contents
of his report (Ex.PW 6/1). Similarly, Majid Khan,
appeared as (PW-7), who also furnished his testimony
before the trial Court as an eyewitness of the alleged
occurrence. It has clearly been mentioned by the
complainant in his report that all the acquitted
accused/respondents came to the spot one after the
other and started firing. In the next sentence of his
report, he differentiated the role of the accused/
respondents and attributed the role of first fire to
accused/respondent Abdul Latif, which hit him on his
right buttock, while the subsequent firing, as a result
of which, he sustained injury on his left buttock, was
attributed to accused/respondents Azhar son of Abdul

Latif and Ayub, Dost Muhammad sons of Samundar.
As per medical evidence furnished by Dr. Shafqat
Younas (PW-1), three entry wounds | x 1 CM were
found on left hip, while since entry wound of 3 x 1.5
CM was found in upper aspect of right hip. During
cross-examination, the said witness admitted that he
has not given the duration of the injuries in his report.
He also admitted that no exit wound was found
against all the four entry wounds and no spent bullet
was extracted from the wounds. The benefit of
omission of such material facts from the medical
report would definitely extends to the defence and no
reliance could be placed on such report in such
circumstances.

7. Obviously, in the event of
indiscriminate firing by six persons simultaneously, it
is absolutely impossible for a victim to note with
exactitude that whose fire hits him on a particular part
of his body. Surprisingly, it is the complainant who
has performed such miracle by differentiating roles of
accused/respondents in the commission of offence and
that too when he received injuries on his hips. As per
medical evidence, the injured complainant was fired

at from back side in view of the locale of injuries. In
such circumstances, surely no one can take notice of
firing being made from behind him. The story
narrated by the complainant in his report suggests that
the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged by him. There is something which
was suppressed by the complainant in order to rope in
falsely various persons of the same family by
ascribing them different roles in the commission of
the offence. Thus, the statement of the injured
complainant in the circumstances of the case does not
ring truth. Mere stamp of injuries on the person of a
witness would not be a proof of the fact that whatever
he deposes would be the truthful account of the
events. His veracity is to be tested from the
circumstances of the case and his own statement
whether it fits in the circumstances of the case or
otherwise. Reliance in this regard is placed on ‘Haji
Bashir Khan Vs. Rehmat Gul and others’ (2016
P.Cr.L.J 568).

8. The other eyewitness Majid improved his
statement by narrating the fact of altercation between
Azhar son of Abdul Latif and Muhammad Shiraz

complainant one day prior to the occurrence. He
further improved his statement by saying that Abdul
Latif told abandoned PW Haider Zaman either he
should come front or go behind and as soon as Haider
Zaman returned back, accused/respondents starting
firing. This witness has not only changed the motive
but has also narrated different facts before alleged
firing was started deliberately and dishonestly to
justify the roles of the accused/respondents in the
commission of the offence. The testimony of such
witness could not be relied upon due to his undoubted
credibility and reliability.

“It is also a settled maxim when a witness
improves his version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved statement
subsequently made cannot be relied upon
as the witness had improved his statement
dishonestly, therefore, his credibility
becomes doubtful on the well-known
principle of criminal jurisprudence that
improvements once found deliberate and
dishonest cast serious doubt on the veracity
of such witnesses.”

9. Admittedly, the injured was shifted to hospital
in a vehicle but neither registration number of the
vehicle nor the name of driver was disclosed by the
complainant, which creates doubts regarding shifting
of injured in the manner as alleged in the statements

of witnesses. In this regard, reliance can be placed on
case titled ‘Nadeem alias Kala vs. The State and
others’ (2018 SCMR 153).

10. The appellant/complainant has not produced a
single independent person in support of his case.
Despite availability, non-production of independent
witnesses by the prosecution also castes serious
doubts regarding genuineness of the prosecution story.
Material witnesses Haider Zaman and Fida were
abandoned by the prosecution being unnecessary.
Moreover, the two 30 bore pistols allegedly recovered
from the accused were sent to the Arms Expert
alongwith alleged empties of 30 bore recovered from
the spot but report in this regard is negative, which
also made a dent in the prosecution case.

11. In view of above discussions, it is crystal clear
that the occurrence as narrated in the FIR has not
taken place in the mode and manner as advanced by
the prosecution. The report was lodged after
preliminary investigation and examination of the
injured complainant, which suggests that consultation
and deliberation were made prior to registration of
case. Furthermore, the case of the prosecution and the

statements of PWs. are full of doubts, contradictions
and improvements. As such, the findings of the
learned trial court were based on proper appreciation
of evidence on record, which are maintained.

12. It is well settled law that even a single doubt,
if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person
to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.
Reliance is placed on case titled Ghulam Qadir Vs.
The State (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held

that:

“It needs no reiteration that for the
purpose of giving benefit of doubt to an
accused person, more than one infirmity is
not required, a single infirmity crating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent mind regarding the
truth of charge-makers the whole case
doubtful. Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does not
absolve the prosecution to prove its case
against the accused beyond any shadow of
doubt in this duty does not change or vary
in the case.”

The Apex Court in case titled ‘Farman Ahmad Vs.
Muhammad Inayat and others’ (2007 SCMR 1825)

has held that:-

“It is also a settled law that there are
different parameters/ principles prescribed
by this Court with regard to decide the
criminal petitions against conviction and
criminal petitions against acquittal. The
impugned judgment with regard to acquittal
Should be either perverse, arbitrary or
without any sustainable reason as law laid
down by this Court.”
10

Similarly, the Honourable Apex Court in Zaheer
Sadiq’s case (2017 SCMR 2007) has mentioned the
golden principle of administration of criminal justice
in the following manner:

“Even otherwise, it is well settled by now
that in criminal cases every accused is
innocent unless proven guilty and upon
acquittal by a court of competent
jurisdiction such presumption doubles. Very
strong and cogent reasons are required to
dislodge such presumption.”

Reliance is also placed on case law reported as
2017 SCMR 1710, 2017 SCMR 1639, 2009 SCMR
230 and 1995 SCMR 1345.

13. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this Court is of the considered view that
the prosecution has failed to bring home charge
against the accused/respondents and order of their
acquittal by the leamed trial Court being
unexceptionable needs no interference by this Court in
its Appellate jurisdiction. Hence, the instant appeal
being devoid of substance is hereby dismissed in
limine.
