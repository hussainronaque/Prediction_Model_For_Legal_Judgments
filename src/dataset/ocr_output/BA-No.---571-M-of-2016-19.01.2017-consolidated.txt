2. The reason for disposal of all these
bail petitions by this singled-out judgment is
that alike facts and legal provisions are to hash

over.

3. The applications addressed to the
District Police Officer Dir Lower at Timergara
in undifferentiated cases would reveal that
under the garb of Mudariba scandal for
investments for a particular period fixed interest
was to be awarded which remained continued
for some time. Later on when money stake was
withheld, under the new enacted law called as
"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition of Interest on
Private Loans Act, 2016" all such cases were

registered by the Station House Officer of
Nawab

Police Station Timergara against the

accused/petitioners.

4. Prior to, for each petitioner an
application was submitted before the Court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila
Qazi Chakdara Camp Court Dir Lower at

Timergara, which met fate in its dismissal.

5. Having heard learned counsel for
each of petitioner and learned State counsel
appearing on behalf of the State, record with

their assistance gone through.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioners
mainly relied on 2016 P Cr. L J 1302
(Peshawar) “Zahid Arif vs Chairman National
Accountability Bureau, NAB and others” and
PLD 2007 Peshawar 39 “Messrs. Gul Cooking
Oil and Vegetable Gee (PVT) LTD through
Chief Executive vs Pakistan through
Chairman Revenue Division, Central Board of
Revenue Islamabad and 6 others”. In view of
the dictum laid down in the earlier referred

judgment of the Hon’ble Peshawar High Court
Nawab

it was emphasized that while interpreting the
statute retrospective effect principle laid down
is that only that law can be given retrospective
effect which brings some changes in procedure.
No retrospective effect can be given to a
substantive law under which certain rights
accrues to a person. Whereas the latter judgment
as has been argued is the mother judgment that
whenever there is an amendment made by the
Parliament or Provincial Assembly such an
amendment shall not apply to the Tribal Areas
automatically. It is with the process as
envisaged in Article 247 of the Constitution that
the President of Pakistan and not the Parliament
to decide which Act was to be applied in the
Tribal Areas. For this specific area where if
cognizable offence is committed the provisions
of the enacted law is not applicable as there is
no specific empowerment by either the Worthy
President or Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
to have made applicable this new enacted law to
the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas.

Inversely, the learned State counsel appearing
Nawab

on behalf of the State did not agree to the
arguments advanced before the Court and
wanted to assure that the law pertaining to the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition of Interest on
Private Loans Act, 2016 is extendable to the
whole of the province. Since then it has come
into force at once on its promulgation, thereby

opposed the grant of bail to each petitioner.

7. Yes by this entity's existence the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition of Interest on
Private Loans Act, 2016 has since come into
force and has been extended to the whole of the
province. whether the Worthy President of
Pakistan or Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
assent is the requirement who by either special
Notification in this behalf has extended this Act
to the District Dir Lower. At present on
tentative assessment, there seems to be an
anomaly by providing for an action to be taken
against the persons who either lend the money
or advance loan to any person for the purpose of
receiving interest thereof. On plain perusal of

Section 6 of the Act ibid, which reads as under: -
Nawab

6. Complaint. --- A justice of peace
Shall, within three days on receipt of
any application or complaint with
regard to the commission of an offence
under this Act, order the local police to
register a case against such person or
group of persons.”

Whereas under section 9, such
offence has been declared cognizable. The

relevant section 9 states:

9. Cognizance of — offences---
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Code or any
other law for the time being in force an
offence under this Act shall be
cognizable, non-compoundable and
non-bailable.

8. While the cases are to be registered
only when complaint is filed before the Ex-
officio justice of peace of the area. Upon his
satisfaction that cognizable case has been made
out only then such complaint with regard to the
commission of offence under the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition of Interest on Private
Loans Act, 2016 can only be registered through

first information report.

9. There is no other procedure given
for registration of the case under the ibid Act.

Thereby all these cases which have been
Nawab

registered either by ASHO or SHO of Police
Station Timergara without recourse to first file
complaint before the Ex-officio justice of peace
and upon his recommendation could only

register the case against the accused/petitioners.

10. Under the new enacted law
pertaining to Prohibition of Interest on Private
Loans Act, 2016, the punishment in
contravention of the provisions of sub-section
(1) has been made punishable with
imprisonment of either description which may
extend to ten years but shall not be less than
three years and shall also be liable to fine not
exceeding one million rupees. While
considering an application for bail it shall not be
an encumber to keep in view the maximum
sentence provided by the Act ibid, but the one
likely to be entailed by the facts and
circumstances. Ref. 2002 P Cr. L J 147

(Peshawar) "Shadi Khan ys the State".

11. On the face of the registration of

each case against each petitioner when the
Nawab

complainant being a Police Officer has not
followed the procedure under section 6 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Prohibition of Interest on
Private Loans Act, 2016 and none of the case has
been registered under the order of Ex-officio
Justice of peace to the local police to register such
case. There are reasons to believe that the
ASHO/SHO of Police Station Timergara has
bypassed the law in this behalf leaving scope for

further inquiry into guilt of each petitioner.

12. In view of what has been discussed
above, all these connected petitions for the grant of
bail are allowed. Each petitioner is entitled to the
concession of bail subject to his furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 100,000/- (Rupees one lac)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa Qazi/Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, who shall ensure that the sureties

are local, reliable and men of means.

These are the reasons of my short

orders of even date.
