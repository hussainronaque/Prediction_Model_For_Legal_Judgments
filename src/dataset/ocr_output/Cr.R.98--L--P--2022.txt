JUDGMENT

FAZAL SUBHAN, J.- This judgment is aimed to decide instant
criminal revision petition filed by the petitioner through which order
dated 15.03.2022 of the Court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge/MCTC, Mardan/Tribunal established under the Foreign
Exchange Regulations Act, 1947 (FER Act, 1947), has been
challenged whereby petition u/s 516-A Cr.P.C, 1898 for return of
foreign currency was dismissed.

2. Facts giving rise to the revision petition are that Assistant
Director FIA, Mardan had information that huge foreign currency is
to be brought to Mardan and Peshawar from Butkhela to different
dealers through motorcar bearing Registration No.AAS-516. Upon
this information a raiding party, named in the murasila, under his

command was constituted, and deployed at Karnal Sher Khan
Interchange Swabi. On arrival of the said motorcar, it was stopped
and two persons Lal Said s/o Khan Said and Wakil Said s/o Anwar
Said, both r/o District Malakand were deboarded. Upon search of
the motorcar, Saudi Riyals 2,22,500/- and Pakistani currency an
amount of Rs.11,270/- alongwith other articles were recovered from
different boxes and upon query, accused Lal Said disclosed that they
work in illegal foreign currency for one Gohar r/o Butkhela, Kamran
Khan r/o Chowk Yadgar, Kazim and Yasir r/o Rawalpindi,
therefore, upon his report, case FIR No.144, dated 01.11.2021, u/s
4/23 FER Act, 1947 read with 3/4 AMLA, 2010 of Police Station
FIA/Cyber Crime, Mardan was registered.

3. The present petitioner through his application dated
02.03.2022 applied for return of Saudi and Pakistani currencies, to
the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Mardan but his
application was turned down through order dated 15.03.2022, hence
this petition.

4. Learned counsel for petitioner in his arguments submitted that
a fake and baseless case has been registered against petitioner rather
he is the lawful owner of the Saudi Riyals, which he received from
one Fazal Akbar s/o Naseeb Khan, after sale of his landed property.
That the said Fazal Akbar works in Saudi Arabia and he paid the

sale consideration in Saudi Riyals instead of Pakistani currency. A
sale deed in this respect has been placed on file to prove the
transaction. It was contended that the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Mardan dismissed the application illegally and disregard to
the relevant law. That petitioner is lawful owner and received the
Saudi Riyals through lawful sources hence impugned order is not
sustainable, thereby praying for acceptance of the revision petition
and return of 2,22,500/- Saudi Riyals on superdari, till the decision
of the case.

5. Conversely, learned AAG on behalf of State submitted that
on the basis of prior information motorcar bearing Registration
No.AAS-516 was stopped and huge foreign currency was recovered
therefrom, being provided to different dealers for illegal currency
exchange. That petitioner alleged to have sold a plot on one Fazal
Akbar and received the Saudi Riyals as sale consideration, and this
aspect was inquired from Deputy Commissioner Malakand which
was responded by Sub-Registrar, District Malakand vide letter
No.59 dated 16.02.2022 denying the existence of any record and the
story forwarded about sale of plot is not confirmed. It was further
submitted that as per Notification No.F.E.4/2018SB Dated
06.08.2018, issued by the State Bank of Pakistan, u/s 4(2)(g) of the
Protection of Economic Reforms Act, 1992, any person carrying

foreign currency notes exceeding US$ 10,000 or equivalent shall
ensure that (1) such foreign currency is acquired through Authorized
Sources and (2) the funds for such acquisition of foreign currency
are legitimate, and in case of failure to prove these two
requirements, the person shall be liable for legal action under FER
Act, 1947 and Anti Money Laundering Act, 2010 or any other law
relating to these offences. That when petitioner has not proved his
ownership nor has provided sufficient proof of authorized and
legitimate sources, then he has not be granted superdari of the
foreign currency.

6. After hearing the above arguments and considering the record
available before this Court, needless it is to say that every citizen of
the country, in view of Article 18 of the Constitution of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, has the right of freedom of trade, business or
profession. The said Article is reproduced for the sake of
convenience and understanding:-

“18, Freedom of trade, business or profession.—
Subject to such qualifications, if any, as may be
prescribed by law, every citizen shall have the right
to enter upon any lawful profession or occupation,
and to conduct any lawful trade or business:”

The above freedom of trade, business and profession is however
subject to the condition that person carrying such profession must
have required qualification and the trade and business must be

lawful. To conduct a legal business of foreign currency, a person has
to seek permission and authorization u/s 3A of the FER Act, 1947,
from the State Bank of Pakistan. At present, the petitioner against
whom a case for illegal foreign exchange currency is registered has
been unable to produce any such permission or authorization. He
rather has taken the plea that he has received such foreign currency
as a sale consideration which on inquiry has been proved
unsubstantiated and groundless. The august Supreme Court of

Pakistan in the case titled The State through Director General

FIA, Islamabad vs. Alif Rehman, reported in 2021 SCMR 503,
has held that:-

“A mechanism has been devised to avail the
benefits of such legislation, which could regulate
the exchange of foreign currency, which
otherwise can be beneficial for the economic and
financial interest of the State. However, any
deviation while defeating the mechanism devised
would adversely affect the interest causing
hazardous affect and result into financial
debacle. Any person who is citizen of Pakistan is
authorized to establish business of foreign
currency notes subject to moving an application
to the State Bank of Pakistan on a prescribed
form after payment of a prescribed fee seeking
permission/authorization.”

7. Taking guidance from the above ruling of the august Supreme
Court and keeping in view the available record it is clear that there is
sufficient material on record to show that the Saudi Riyals 2,22,500/-
were recovered from motorcar occupied by two accused Lal Said
and Wakil Said r/o Butkhela, who have given affidavit that this

foreign currency was given to them for exchange. No permission or
authorization of State Bank is available with the petitioner. This
being the situation, the two conditions of last possessor or bonafide
ownership of the petitioner are not forthcoming, and therefore the
impugned order is neither found to be illegal nor perverse, hence the
impugned order is maintained and this revision petition, being

without merit, is dismissed.
