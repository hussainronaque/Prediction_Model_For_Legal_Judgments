MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR.J:-_ Mst.
Dilara Bibi has sought the jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read with
Section 561-A Cr.PC for quashment of FIR
No.392 dated 22.07.2019 under Sections 365-
B/109 PPC Police Station Topi, Swabi.

2. I have heard learned counsel for
petitioner and perused the available record with
his valuable assistance.

3. Perusal of the record reveals that the
grievance of the petitioner alleged by here is
that she has falsely been implicated in the FIR
with malafide intention.

4. It is settled principle of law that this

Court has limited scope and jurisdiction under
the Provision of Article 199 of the constitution
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

5. Obviously, criminal cases are decided
on the basis of material so collected by the
prosecution during the course of investigation
and the evidence so recorded by the trial Court
and that too after appraisal of evidence by it in
accordance with law. In the present case FIR
has already been registered against the
petitioner and investigation is in progress. At
his stage case of the petitioner cannot be

considered under Section 561-A_ Cr.PC.

Moreover, this Court would refrain from
rendering any finding on the merit of the case
at this stage, which may prejudice the case of
the petitioner in any manner whatsoever and
considers that the legal and factual issues
raised in the present petition can be taken by
the petitioner in the first instance before the
investigating officer and then even before the
framing of charge before the trial Court, if at
all challan is submitted against the petitioner
and the learned trial Court has the power to
discharge the petitioner.

6. The apex Court has held in Col. Shah
Sadiq’s case (2006 SCMR 276) in unequivocal
terms:

“7. It is also a settled proposition of law
that if prima facie an offence has been
committed, ordinary course of trial
before the Court should not be allowed
to be deflected by resorting to
constitutional jurisdiction of High
Court. By accepting the constitutional
petition the High Court erred in law to
short circuit the normal procedure of
law as provided under Cr.P.C. and
police rules while exercising equitable
jurisdiction which is not in consonance
with the law laid down by this Court in
A. Habib Ahmad v. M.K.G. Scott
Christian PLD 1992 SC 353. The
learned High Court had quashed the
F.LR. in such a manner as if the
respondent had filed an appeal before
the High Court against order passed by
trial Court. The learned High Court had
no jurisdiction to quash the impugned
F.LR. by appreciation of the documents
produced by the parties without
providing chance to cross-examine or
confronting the documents in question.
Respondents had alternative 'remedy to
raise objection at the time of framing
the charge against them by the trial
Court or at the time of final disposal of
the trial after recording the evidence.
Even otherwise, respondents have more
than one alternative remedies before the
trial Court under the Cr.P.C. i.e. section
265-K, 249-A or to approach the
concerned Magistrate for cancellation
of the case under provisions of Cr.P.C.
The respondents have following
alternative remedies under Cr.P.C.:--

(a) To appear before the Investigating
Officer to prove their innocence.

(b) To approach the competent higher
authorities of the Investigating Officer
having powers vide section 551 of
Cr.P.C.

(c) After completion of _ the
investigation, the Investigating Officer
has to submit case to the concerned
Magistrate and the Magistrate
concerned has power to discharge them
under section 63 of the Cr.P.C. in case
of their innocence.

(d) In case he finds the respondents
innocent, he would refuse to take
cognizance of the matter.
(e) Rule 24.7 of the Police Rules of
1934 makes a provision for cancellation
of cases during the course of
investigation under the orders of the
concerned Magistrate.

(f) There are then remedies which are
available to accused persons who claim
to be innocent and who can seek relief
without going through the entire length
of investigations.
A similar proposition under consideration
before the Supreme Court of AJK in case
titled Khadim Hussain Vs Abdul Basit and 6
others (2002 MLD 1250) wherein it was held
that:
“The High Court has no
jurisdiction to quash criminal
proceedings at the stage of
investigation. It was further
opined that High Court in
exercise of writ jurisdiction is not
competent to assume the role of
investigating agency or the trial
Court is to give verdict as to
whether an accused person has
committed an offence or not”
7. In view of the above dictum held by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court, it is held and
factual Controversy involved in the present
case cannot be resolved in constitutional
jurisdiction and similarly deviation from
normal procedure of law as provided in Cr.PC,
it is not inconsonance with principle besides
when an alternate remedy under the law

available to the petitioner constitutional

jurisdiction cannot be exercised.
8. The petitioner has adequate alternate
remedy available to her and thus, it would be
appropriate that the petitioner should agitate
all these legal and factual points before the
trial Court.

9. Accordingly for the reason stated
hereinabove, this petition being without any

force is hereby dismissed in limine.
