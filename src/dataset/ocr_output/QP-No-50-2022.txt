2. The case of the prosecution, in a nutshell, is that

complainant Mst. Sidra Farhad daughter of Farhad Hussain

of Farhad Hussain, father of the complainant, was also

and were taken into possession vide memo (EX PW 3/2).
The complainant further stated that the petitioner-accused °
has extended threats through face book ID accessible
through link facebook.com/profile.
Php?id=100010367388107 for sharing the objectionable
pictures on social media. The motive advanced by the
complainant that sister of the appellant was charged for the
murder of granddaughter of the complainant and the

accused-petitioner was compelling them for compromise.
The ownership of the SIM number +92 332 1929159 was
received from the Telecom company; that accused was
directed to attend the FIA office; that on 23.09.2021
accused-petitioner attended the office of FIA CCRC,
Peshawar, and on his pointation mobile phone Samsung
SM-G610F bearing serial No.RZ9K10Z!9BW was
recovered from the motorcar bearing registration No.ARV-
320, Chassis No.NZE120-6025310. The mobile phone of
accused, SIM number +92 332 1929159 and WhatApp
account number +92 332 1929159 used in the offence were
found active in the mobile phone of accused. The
objectionable pictures were also found in the mobile phone
of accused-petitioner and in this respect Technical
Analysis report (EX PW 3/3) was also prepared.
Consequently, the accused-petitioner was arrested and the
case FIR was registered against him.

3. After completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted before the Court. Formal charge against the
accused-petitioner was framed to which he did not plead

guilty and claimed trial.
4. The prosecution in support of its case examined as
many as five witnesses. After closure of prosecution
evidence statement of accused under section-342 Cr. PC
was recorded, wherein he professed and false implication.
He neither wished to be examined on oath within the
meaning of section-340(2) Cr.PC nor opted to produce
defence evidence. After hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, the learned trial Court vide
judgment and order dated 18.04.2022 convicted and
sentenced the accused-petitioner for a period of three years
RI with a fine of Rs.200,000/- or in default, accused shall
further undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six
months. The accused-petitioner was also convicted under
section-24 PECA of 2016 to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of one year with a fine of
Rs.20,000/- or in default accused shall further undergo
simple imprisonment for a period of three months and all
the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Benefit of
section-382-B Cr. PC was extended to the accused-

petitioner.
5. Being dissatisfied from the judgment and order of
the learned trial Court mentioned above, Naveed Ahmad,
the petitioner, filed Criminal Appeal No.01 of 2022 against
his conviction and sentence, Mst. Sidra Farhad, the
complainant, and State filed Criminal Revisions No.08 &
09 of 2022 respectively for enhancement of sentences
awarded to the accused-petitioner Farhad before the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IX, Peshawar
(Appellate Court) and after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, the Appellate Court vide impugned
judgment and order dated 08.06.2022 modified the
sentence and the appellant was convicted with sentence for
a term of Rigorous Imprisonment of two years with fine of
Rs.200,000/- under section-21 of PECA, 2016 or in default
of fine he shall further undergo simple imprisonment for
six months and maintained the conviction of the accused-
petitioner u/s-24 of PECA, 2016 while the Criminal
Revisions No.08 & 09 filed by the complainant and State
were dismissed. Hence, the accused-petitioner Naveed
Ahmad, complainant Mst. Sidra Farhad and the State have

impugned the judgment and order of the learned Appellate
Court by filing respective Quashment Petitions mentioned
in the opening paragraph of the judgment before this
Court. Petition No.50-P/2022 has been filed by the
petitioner-accused under section-561-A read with Section-
439 Cr.PC and Criminal Revision No.124-P/2022 filed by
Mst. Sidra Farhad for enhancement of sentence. Once
Revisional powers has been exercised by the Revisional
Court i.e learned Appellate Court, therefore, second
revision is not competent. Hence, this Quashment Petition
No.50-P/2022 is treated only under section-561-A Cr. PC,
while Cr. Revision No.124-P/2022 is dismissed being not
maintainable.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties were
heard and available record gone through.

7. Spying is an infringement of privacy rights. The
Holy Quran, therefore, expressly forbids it. Surah Al-
Hujurat Ayah 12 (Translation by A. Yusuf Ali) reads;
sacs Y5*2) Sh ats) Si o& OES Ly! (phic all WH
O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as
possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: and spy not
on each other nor speak ill of each other behind their
backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead
brother? Nay ye would abhor it...but fear Allah: for Allah
is Oft-Returning Most Merciful.

Again, in Islam, the prohibition on spying is all-
pervasive and reaches every conceivable sphere of human
activity. In Al-Jaami As-Saghir by Imam Suyuti, tradition
is reported from the Holy Prophet;

"One who looks into the letter of his brother
without his permission is like looking into the fire
of Hell."

In his book, the dignity of man: An Islamic
perspective (Second enhanced edn. Cambridge: The
Islamic Texts Society, 2002.), Mohammad Hashim
Kamali, has looked into the subject with a keen eye. While
discussing Satr al-aurat as a significant theme of personal
privacy, he refers to Hadith from Tirmidhi;

"Do not annoy your fellow Muslims, do not impute

evil to them, and do not uncover their nakedness.

For behold, anyone who exposes the nakedness of

his Muslim brother, God will expose his

nakedness".

As expounded by the author, privacy, as a
component of human dignity, is highly valued in the moral

fabric of Islam. The expanse of privacy rights is vast and
ranges from domestic sanctity to interpersonal
communication. The author similarly explains that since a
firm commitment to virtue serves as a foundation for
human relationships, there would be zero tolerance for

intrusion of any type. Surah An-Nur, Ayat 27-28 reads;

VV. \giludy galt (is poses oe yh GS Y Lid gah Glu
5958S lal SI 8 Sb Te

27. O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than
Your own, until ye have asked permission and saluted

those in them: that is best for you, in order that Ye may

heed (what is seemly).

VAL Nghe! AS) da Sly a8) GAH Lis W LES 3 al taal Ide a

28. If ye find no one in the house, enter not until
permission is given to you: if ye are asked to go back, go
back : That makes for greater purity for yourselves: and
God knows well all that ye do.

(Translation by A. Yusuf Ali).
In, Sahih, Hadith is reported from Abu Musa;

Ca yc a4 357) als UG Shai gil 1y

(If any one of you asks for permission three times and it
is not given, then let him go away.)
10

Doubtlessly, the teachings of Islam are for all climes and
times.

These preliminaries were necessary given the devastating
impact of technology in our social life and the need for
impressing upon the teachings of Islam.

8. Now to facts.

The case of the prosecution, in a nutshell, is that
complainant Mst, Sidra Farhad daughter of Farhad Hussain
submitted a written complaint (EX PW 2/1) against the

against the accused-petitioner was framed to which he did

many as five witnesses. After the closure of the
prosecution evidence statement of accused under section-
342 Cr. PC was recorded, wherein he professed innocence
and false implication. He neither wished to be examined on
oath within the meaning of section 340 (2) Cr.PC nor

12. After hearing arguments of learned counsel for the

dated 18.04.2022 convicted and sentenced the accused-

13

period of three months and all the sentences were ordered

his conviction and sentence, Mst. Sidra Farhad, the
complainant and State filed Criminal Revisions No.08 &

while the Criminal Revisions No.08 & 09 filed by the

accused-petitioner Naveed Ahmad, complainant Mst. Sidra
Farhad and the State have impugned the judgment and
order of the learned Appellate by filing Quashment
Petition mentioned in the opening paragraph of the
judgment before this Court.

14. During the course of the trial, the prosecution
examined Farhad Hussain father of the complainant. as
(PW-01) who in his examination-in-chief supported the
version of the complainant by stating that on 24" March
2021, the sister of the accused facing trial Mst. Rabia
Jabeen charged with the murder of his grand daughter, and
produced her picture before the Court (EX PW 1/1);
thereafter messages were sent he threatened him that if bail
of his sister is dismissed (inadvertently written as
accepted), that he will be disgraced and humiliated in the
society; that the accused also sent/transmitted threatening
messages and handed over the same to the FIA officials
consisting of 12 pages (EX PW 1/3); that when the bail

petition of Mst. Rabia Jabeen, sister of the accused, was
15

dismissed by PHC, Peshawar, vide order dated 20.09.2021,
on the next day, the accused sent him on his WhatsApp
number explicit picture’s of his daughter and threatened
him that if he does not enter into a compromise with them
then he will make the picture viral on Social Media. Mst.
Sidra Farhad, the complainant, (PW-02) reiterated the
same story which she mentioned in her complaint (EX PW
2/1) and further stated that the sister of accused Naveed
murdered her niece 11 months ago: that her bail
application was dismissed by the august PHC, Peshawar.
on 20.09.2021 and on 21.09.2021 the accused sent
objectionable pictures to her father and threatened her
father that if they don’t compromise the matter with her
sister, then he will share the objectionable pictures on
social Media.

15. Muhammad Noman SI (PW-03) deposed that the
inquiry in the instant case was marked to him; that after
recording statement of the complainant and her father, he
requested the concerned quarter regarding ownership of
SIM No.0332-1929159 according to which the same SIM

was registered in the name of accused facing trial, the
16
report whereof is (EX PW 3/1) consisting of two pages;
that he seized the mobile phone of complainant/victim’s
father vide memo (EX PW 3/2), the Technical Analysis

attended the FIA office/PS; that the official recovered the
mobile phone along with SIM of the accused and took the
articles aforesaid into possession vide memo (EX PW 3/5),
arrested the accused vide his card of arrest (EX PW 3/8);
that he handed over the case property recovered from the
father of the compiainant and seized from the accused for
Forensic Analysis through Form F-31, which are (EXPW
3/14 & EX PW 3/15) respectively and received the FSL
report comprising of 28 pages (EX PW 3/17) along with
CD (EX PW 3/17-A), and recorded statements of PWs and

that of accused u/s-161 Cr. PC.

16. Muhammad Shoaib Khattak HC (PW-04) deposed
that he is the scriber of the complaint (EX PW 2/1),

marginal witness to the recovery memo (EX PW 3/2)
17

through which the I.O took into possession mobile phones
from the complainant’s father, recovery memo (EX PW
3/5 & 3/6) vide which the IO took into possession mobile
phone and vehicle of the accused, vide recovery memo
(EX PW 3/12) vide which I.O seized the Facebook account
from the accused.

17. Muhammad Faizan Khan AD FIA (PW-05) deposed
that he I.O sealed two mobile phones through Forms F-31
with the scope written on the form and the sample of
pictures in the instant case; that he searched for the scope
mentioned in Forms (PW 3/14 & EX PW 3/15) founded
evidence related to the scope provided by the LO and after
the detailed analysis, he prepared a report and the sealed
mobile phones vide (EX PW 3/17), CD vide memo EX
PW 3/17-A)

18. The complainant, her father, and other prosecution
witnesses were cross-examined at length by the defence
counsel but nothing was elicited from them which could
shatter their credibility. As per the forensic analysis report,
the presence of the pictures of the lady in the accused

mobile phone in the folder having the file path
18

raw/phone/raw3/DCIM/PICS/, suggest that the pictures are
present in the “PICS” folder in the gallery of the accused's
mobile while the presence of the complainant’s pictures on
the accused mobile phone in the folder having the file path
raw/phone/raw3/WhatsA pp/Media/WhatsA pp Images/sent/
suggest that the accused has transmitted the complainant’s
pictures through WhatsApp and are found in the “sent”
folder of WhatsApp and the presence of the complainant’s
pictures in her father’s mobile phone in the
folder(raw/phone/raw0/storage/emulated/0/WhatsA pp/Med
ia/WhatsAppImages/: File Path) suggests that the
complainant’s father has received the complainant’s
pictures through WhatsApp which are found in the
“WhatsApp Images" folder of WhatsApp.

19. The available record clearly shows the motive
behind the occurrence has reasonably and plausibly been
explained by the complainant and her father in their
respective statements recorded during the trial.

20. It has thus been proved beyond doubt that the
appellant has sent explicit content of the complainant and

messages to her father Farhad Hussain. The Prevention of
19

Electronic Crimes Act 2016 addresses various crimes by
the name of Cyber Crimes. Such crimes, though taking
various forms, can be broadly classified under the scheme
of the Act as either directly targeting an electronic device
or using it to facilitate other crimes. The present case
concerns transmission through an electronic device as well
as cyber stalking used to intimidate and influence the
outcome of a murder charge. The transmission of images is
the means to achieve the end goal, and charges have been
laid under sections 21 and 24 of the Act, which has been
duly proved by the prosecution and the petitioner-accused
has been rightly convicted and sentenced by the learned
lower forums.

21. Finally, it may be observed that both the parties as
well as State have availed the remedy of appeal and
revisions and now they have filed the quashment petitions
under Section-561- A Cr. PC against the judgment and
order dated 08.06.2022 passed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-IX, Peshawar.

22. The circumspection with which the powers under

section Section-561- A Cr. PC are exercised is all too
ed

20

manifest to require repetition. In this case, the prime
question turned on the accused transmitting the messages.
The courts below examined this aspect in depth,
particularly the expert's testimony confirming the
transmission of a message through the accused's mobile
phone, which in cases involving digital evidence carries
considerable weight. Factual findings by lower fora’s carry
significant weight and cannot be altered at the altar of
every doubtful may.

For what has been discussed above, all three
quashment petitions mentioned above are dismissed. The
benefit of section-382-B Cr. PC has already been extended
to the petitioner-accused and the substantive sentences has
also been ordered to run concurrently.
