JUDGMENT

WIQAR_ AHMAD, J.- Through this judgment,
we intend to decide a preliminary question
regarding maintainability of the writ petitions
bearing Nos. 737-M/2020, 1366-M/2020, 6-M/

2021 and 714-M/2020.

2. While hearing the cases in limine, the
question regarding maintainability of the instant
writ petitions required determination for the reason
that Section 8-A has been inserted in the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as
the “Act”) vide the Illegal Dispossession
(Amendment) Act, 2017 and thereby a forum of
appeal had been provided. All these cases except
W.P No. 6-M/2021 have been arising out of
summary rejection of the complaints, whereas, the
above-mentioned writ petition has been arising out
of order dated 05.12.2020 of learned Additional
Sessions Judge Malakand at Dargai, whereby
complaint of petitioners had been dismissed and the
accused facing trial (respondents No. 2 & 4 to 6) as
well as the absconding accused (respondent No. 3)
had been acquitted of the charges leveled against
them. The question that has cropped up before this
Court was, “whether an order whereby complaint
filed under section 3 of the Act is summarily

rejected would be appealable or not?”
3. Section 8-A of the Act provided;

“8A, Appeal. Any order made under sub-
section (2) and sub-section (3) of Section 3
and sub-section (1) of Section 8 shall,
within thirty days of the order, be
appealable before the High Court.”

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

Since, specific clauses had been
mentioned by the legislature while making the
orders passed there-under appealable, therefore
certain confusion existed whether an order of
conviction passed under sub-section (2) and sub-
section (3) of Section 3 of the Act and restoration
of possession under sub-section (1) of Section 8 of
the Act (specified in the amending act) would only
be appealable or other orders passed under the Act

would also be appealable?

4. Learned counsel for petitioners in
most of these cases had argued that scope of
Section 8-A of the Act had been kept limited by the
legislature and therefore impugned orders in
the constitutional petitions had not been appealable.
They had been unanimous that except order of
conviction passed by a Court under sub-section (2)
and sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act, other
orders would not be appealable and that they had

therefore filed writ petitions against said orders.

55 Learned Addl:A.G appearing on
behalf of the State has however been contending
that a remedy of appeal had been provided by way

of Section 8-A of the Act and therefore the instant

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Az

constitutional petitions had not been maintainable
as all the impugned orders had been covered by the

words “any order” used in Section 8-A of the Act.

6. Mr. Abdul Nasir Advocate, learned
amicus curiae appointed in one of the cases (W.P
No. 6-M/2021) also relied upon a Single Member
Bench judgment of this Court passed in Cr.M
No. 3-M/2019 (Leave to appeal) and contended
that appeals lie against “any order”, which
wordings should be construed liberally and that all
the orders passed under the Act would be

appealable under section 8-A of the Act.

de We have heard arguments of learned

amicus curiae, learned counsel for the parties and

learned Addl:A.G appearing on behalf of the State.

8. Section 3 of the Act provided for
preventing illegal dispossession from immovable
property and has also provided punishment for
contravention of the provision thereof. Said Section

__ being relevant is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

“3, Prevention of illegal possession of
property, ete. (1) No one shall enter into
or upon any property to dispossess, grab,
control or occupy it without having any
lawful authority to do so with the

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-

intention to dispossess grab, control or
occupy the property from owners or
occupier of such property.

(2) Whoever contravenes the provisions of
the subsection (1) shall, without prejudice
to any punishment to which he may be
liable under any other law for the time
being in force, be punishable with
imprisonment which may extend to ten
years and with fine and the victim of the
offence shall also be compensated in
accordance with the provision of Section
544-A of the Code.

(3) Whoever forcibly and wrongfully
dispossesses any owner or occupier of any
property and his act does not fall within
sub-section (1), shall be punished with
imprisonment which may extend to three
years or with fine or with both, in
addition to any other punishment to
which he may be liable under any other
law for the time being in force. The
person dispossessed shall also be
compensated in accordance’ with
provisions of section 544-A of the Code.”

9. The above reproduced Section has
been providing for definition of the offence of
illegal dispossession as well as furnishing penalty
for contravention thereof. The punishment provided
under subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Act has
been covering the case of contravention of the
dictates of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Act.
Subsection (3) of Section 3 of the Act covers all the
rest of cases of forcible and wrongful
dispossession. Section 8 of the Act provided for the

remedy of restoration of possession in the cases of

wrongful dispossession from immovable property

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-6-
as provided in Section 3 of the Act. Section 8-A of

the Act has made all the orders passed under
subsections (2) and (3) of Section 3 of the Act as
well as orders passed for restoration of possession
under subsection (1) of Section 8 of the Act as

appealable.

10. For interpreting Section 8-A of the Act
so as to find its true intent, purpose and scope, we
would be studying it according to both the literal as
well as purposive rules of interpretation. To discern
the scope of Section 8-A of the Act, we would first
interpret it according to the literal rule of
construction. Section 8-A of the Act starts with the
connotation “any order made”. The word “any”
is a word of vast amplitude. “Any” has been
explained in Oxford Dictionary in its 12" edition

as;

“To refer to one or some of a thing or
number of things, no matter how much or
how many.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
while giving its judgment in the case of
Government of NWFP through Chief Secretary
and another vs Muhammad Irshad and 3 others

reported as PLD 1995 Supreme Court 281, has

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Ae

also held that the word “any” is ordinarily used to
enlarge the amplitude of the term to which it is
attached. Similarly, in the matter of Reference No.
2 of 2005 by the President of Pakistan reported as
PLD 2005 Supreme Court 873 at 951 while
interpreting Article 186 of the Constitution, the
connotation “any question of law” conferring
advisory jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court of
Pakistan was interpreted as having widened
jurisdiction of the Court and made it more
comprehensive in its scope and thereby covering
both the questions of law that had arisen as well as

the question of law that was likely to arise.

11. Legislature has purposely used the
word “any” because it had been cognizant of the
fact that an entire mechanism relating to filing,
scope and the categories of appealable orders had
not been furnished in the Act (like it stood provided
under Cr. PC). The legislature therefore intended to
cover the full spectrum of orders passed under
_, subsections (2) and (3) of Section 3 of the Act as
well as all the orders passed under subsection (1) of
Section 8 of the Act. When we say that the full
spectrum of orders passed there-under, it cannot

then be limited to orders of conviction passed under

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
A

8-
subsections (2) and (3) of Section 3 of the Act or

affirmatively making an order for restoration of
possession under subsection (1) of Section 8 of the
Act. It would include all the orders passed under
said provision of law including the refusal to pass
such orders there-under. Therefore, when
allegations of commission of an offence under
section 3 of the Act are brought before a competent
Court, then there may emerge two situations, one is
that the Court finds those allegations substantially
true and proved beyond reasonable doubt, and then
pass an order of conviction under subsection (2) or
subsection (3) of Section 3 of the Act; the other
situation may be that when a Court entertains
reasonable doubts that the prosecution or
complainant has failed to prove case against the
respondent/accused, then in that case the Court
would naturally pass an order for acquittal and
would hold that contravention of the provisions of
Section 3 of the Act have not been proved. The
latter case would also be covered in the definition
of the words “any order” and would therefore
be appealable under section 8-A of the Act.
Another scenario which is more pertinent to

the case in hand has been that a person comes up

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-

with a complaint of commission of contravention of
the provisions of Section 3 of the Act. The Court
marks such complaint for investigation under
section 5 of the Act, wherein the investigation
report is submitted and the Court comes to the
conclusion that there has been no substance in the
allegations of illegal dispossession as levied in the
complaint and dismiss the same summarily. In that
case also, the Court gives a finding, on the basis of
material before it, that the allegations of
contravention of provisions of subsection (1) of
Section 3 of the Act as well as wrongful
dispossession alleged otherwise have not been
committed. Such order would also be considered an
order made under subsections (2) and (3) of Section
3 of the Act. It also needs mention here that Section
5 of the Act provides for investigation but it has not
provided for powers of the Court to dismiss a
complaint in a summary manner. We can therefore
easily say that the order of summary dismissal of
complaint has not been an order under section 5 or
any other provision of the Act but an order made

under section 3 of the Act.

12. Subsection (2) of Section 3 of the Act

has also been containing general words like it

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

makes an act punishable because of contravention
of the provision of subsection (1) of Section 3 of
the Act. When the Court say that contravention of
the provision of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the
Act had not taken place — whether it is after a full-
fledged trial or after the investigation is conducted
and the person has not yet been indicted — it would
carry same effect that the Court has held that a case
of contravention of subsection (1) of Section 3 of
the Act has not been existing. In such a situation, it
would equally be an order under subsection (2) or
subsection (3) of Section 3 of the Act, for the
purpose of Section 8-A of the Act. It becomes clear
that it was for this very reason of intending to cover
all the orders passed under subsections (2) and (3)
of Section 3 of the Act that the legislature has used
the words “any order”. Same would be the case of
refusal to handover possession under subsection (1)
of Section 8 of the Act and all the orders passed
under said provision of law would no doubt be

appealable.

13. An Hon’ble Single Member Bench of
this Court while resolving a similar controversy in

the case of Mst. Farah Deeba vs. Said

Muhammad and another (Cr.M No. 03-M/2019

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
-11-
(Leave _to_appeal)) has also reached to similar

conclusion, wherein it has been observed;

“Section 3 (1) of the Act makes illegal
occupying of the property as an offence
and subsections (2) and (3) thereof
provides the punishment for illegal
occupation of the property. It is the
discretion of the trial Court, either to
acquit or convict the accused or even
dismiss the complaint, if found non-
maintainable, keeping in view the law and
evidence on record. The said order of
acquittal of the accused, dismissal of the
complaint or conviction of the accused
would fall within the mischief of word
“order” and are thus appealable in terms
of section 8-A of the Act. Similarly the
dismissal of the complaint will have the
same consequences because the
complaint, as provided in the Act, is not
synonymous with the complaint as
provided in section 4 (h) of the Code.”

14, While adopting the purposive
approach, we can also identify the mischief with
ease for suppression of which this Section had been
provided. While giving judgment in the case of
Mian Sharif Shah vs Nawab Khan and 5 others
reported as PLD 2011 Peshawar 86, a full Bench
of this Court had advised the Provincial
Government to insert a provision in the Act, which
would provide for remedy of an appeal to a person
aggrieved of an order of his conviction or acquittal
under the Act. Relevant part of observation in this
regard is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

“Now the question is as to what should be
the better course to provide a remedy of
an appeal to the aggrieved person from
the order of conviction or acquittal,
passed by the Court of Session under the
Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005. It is well
entrenched principle of law that no
criminal Court of Tribunal shall be
invested with absolute authority
particularly, in cases where right to
liberty and property of a citizen is
involved. If finality is attached to the
judgment of the Sessions Court then, in
cases of patent injustice committed to
anyone either in case of conviction or that
of acquittal, the only remedy for the
aggrieved person would be to file a
constitutional petition under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, however, it is an ironclad
principle of law that in writ jurisdiction,
the High Court is neither supposed nor it
is permissible for it to make reappraisal
of evidence or determine the controversy
of facts and to draw conclusion therefrom
like a Court of appeal, hence, such
remedy, being of a very restricted scope,
is not efficacious in any manner, thus,
conviction recorded or order of acquittal
passed causing miscarriage of justice
would go unchecked at High Court level.
There may be cases where valuable State
property is grabbed but the culprits are
acquitted, thus, the public exchequer
would suffer irreparable loss. In such
circumstances, the land “MAFIA” and
property grabbers, the most influential
devious by manipulating to go scot-free
would successfully defeat the objects and
purpose of the very law and its efficacy
would be brought to naught which may
lead to dangerous results.”

15, Most noticeable in the above
reproduced para is that this Court while impressing
upon the relevant authorities the need for
introducing the amendment had also held that writ
jurisdiction of a High Court could not be used for

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
<13=

determining a controversy of facts and to draw
conclusions there-from like a Court of appeal
would be able to do. It was also held that powers
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 being restricted would
not be sufficient and efficacious for determination
of various factual controversies that may be arising
out of petitions filed against orders passed under
various provisions of the Act. Such findings of the
Court had not been binding on the legislature but
are only quoted so as to have a glimpse of the
background in which Section 8-A had been added
to the Act. We entertain no doubt that the provision
of appeal had been inserted in order to make the
orders passed under the Act appealable before an
appellate Court, which may have the powers and
competence to give a rethought to the factual issues
involved therein. Provisions of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898 (hereinafter referred to as
“Cr. PC”) had been made applicable under section
9 of the Act and when the right of appeal had also
stood furnished, then we can safely make resort to
the provisions of Cr. PC for knowing the powers of
an appellate Court. The appellate Court would

therefore have all the powers of an appellate Court

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

provided under the relevant provisions of Cr. PC.
Purpose of the legislature while inserting Section
8-A in the Act had therefore been clear that it
wanted to make orders passed under the Act
appealable so as to afford a chance to the aggrieved
party, which may be complainant or accused to
avail the remedy of appeal, wherein the appellate
forum would have all the powers for
re-assessing the material available on record as well
as re-appreciating the evidence, as the case may be.
Therefore, the literal construction supplemented by
purposive construction in some respects are leading
us to the conclusion that all the orders passed under
section 3 of the Act as well as sub-section (1) of
Section 8 of the Act have been made appealable

before the High Court.

16, The mischief rule is most often
employed where a departure from the literal
meaning is needed to avoid absurdity, but not so
always. Mr. S.M Zafar while seconding the
observations expressed in statutory interpretation
by F. Bennion 5™ edition has observed in his book

Understanding Statutes at page 20;

“The mischief rule was a_ great
improvement on the then prevailing

ee
Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

literal rule, it at least encourages the
Courts to have regard to the context in
which the doubtful words appear.
Language cannot be properly understood
without some knowledge of the context. It
is therefore obviously sensible to permit
and even encourage the Court to go
beyond the narrow confines of the
disputed phrase. The mischief rule is
designed to get the Court to consider why
the Act was passed and then to apply that
knowledge in giving the words under
consideration whatever meaning will best
accord with the social purpose of the
legislation.”

Recourse is not made here to
purposive construction for the reason that a
departure is needed from plain language of the
statute but for unearthing the intention of
legislature and having a holistic view of the
situation. Purposive construction is being employed
here in addition to literal construction and not as its

substitute in entirety.

17. In light of what has been discussed
above, we answer the question to the effect that
all orders passed under subsections (2) and (3)
of Section 3 of the Act, including the orders of
conviction or acquittal of the accused or dismissal
of complaint for there-being no case of
contravention of provisions of Section 3 of the Act,
would be appealable under section 8-A of the
Act. Resultantly, we order all these writ petitions
to be converted into appeals filed under section

i

8-A of the Act, against the impugned orders by

relying upon judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad
Akram vs. DCO Rahim Yar Khan reported as
2017 SCMR 56. Office shall accordingly fix all

these cases before appropriate Benches for further

proceedings.
