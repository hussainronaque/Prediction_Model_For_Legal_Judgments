Vs

JUDGMENT

Date ofhearing: 02.3.2020.

For Appellant: Ms. Nosheen Ahmad, Advocate.
For State: Mr. Shahid Hameed, Addl: A.G.

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- This appeal under Section 48
of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, is directed
against the judgment dated 19.11.2019, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Model Criminal Trial Court, Lakki

Marwat, in case FIR No.696 dated 06.9.2017, police station

Naurang, whereby appellant Haris Malik was convicted under

Section 9(C) CNS Act and sentenced to imprisonment for life

with fine of Rs.1,00,000/- (rupees one hundred thousand) or in
default thereof to further undergo six months simple
imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended

to him.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the FIR Ex.
PW 1/1, registered on the basis of murasila Ex. PW 2/1, is that
on 06.9.2017, Arif Khan SHO (PW-2) alongwith. police
personnel made a Nakabandi on metal road, within limits of

Tarkha Bazi Khel, meanwhile, a motorcar bearing registration

No.ZJ-210/ICT was stopped. During search of the said
motorcar, 14 packets containing charas were recovered from its
secret cavities. On weighment, each packet came out to be
1000/1000 grams, in toto, the recovered Charas stood 14
kilogram. The accused disclosed his name as. Haris Malik, who

was arrested and booked in the captioned FIR.

3. On completion of investigation, challan was

submitted against the accused before the learned trial Court

where accused was charged for the offence to which he-

claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as six witnesses, whereafter, accused was
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither he opted to
be examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor produced
evidence in his defence. Learned trial Court, after hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, vide impugned
judgment dated 19.11.2019, convicted the appellant and
sentenced him, as mentioned above, which has been assailed by

the appellant through the instant appeal.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It was on 06.9.2017, that Arif Khan SHO (PW-2)

alongwith police personnel had laid Nakabandi on the spot

when a motorcar bearing registration No.ZJ-210/ICT was

stopped and during its search 14 packets containing Charas
were recovered from its secret cavities, which on weighment

stood fourteen (14) kilograms. The prosecution witnesses were

cross-examined at length regarding the mode and manner of
recovery, but the defence failed to create dents as all the
witnesses remained consistent on material aspects of the case:
The defence alleged mala fide to the seizing officer, who even
failed to convince us that why the police would plant such a
huge quantity against the accused and that why an attempt was
made to implicate the appellant if innocent. The appellant and
the police officials had nothing in common which could
persuade us to hold otherwise. The manner in which ‘the
recovery was effected, the process of weighment, the case
property sealed and the investigation conducted tells that the
case was investigated on proper lines with strict adherence to
the law and procedure. The defence failed to point out major
discrepancies in the statements of witnesses, which could prove
fatal for the prosecution case. It was argued for the appellant
that no efforts were made to associate private witnesses to
witness the recovery but his this submission holds no ground as
Section 29 of The Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, has done
away with such formalities. Even otherwise, police officials are
as good witnesses as others are that too when no mala fide was

either alleged or proved against them.

In case titled Abdul Rasheed Vs. The State (2009
SCMR 306), it was held that:

“The prosecution witnesses being members of the
raiding party were the natural witnesses and
their testimony cannot be discarded merely on the
ground that they were the employees of the polic
force”. ;

In case reported as Gul Alam Vs. The_state

through Advocate General N.-W.F.P. (2011 SCMR 624), it

was held that:

“No enmity, or grudge has been alleged against
the prosecution witnesses to falsely implicate the
petitioner and despite lengthy cross-examination,
their veracity could not be shattered and nothing |
favourable to the defence could be extracted from
their statements. A large quantity of about 11 Kgs
of ‘charas’ could not be thrust upon the petitioner
in absence of any tangible and concrete enmity,
which has not been proved by the defence”.

6. There is no denial to the fact that it was the
accused who was driving the motorcar at the time of arrest, that
the recovery was effected from the secret cavities of the car and
that the accused could not dislodge himself from the motorcar.
This is admitted on record that it was none else but the accused
who was driving the car at the time of arrest and recovery, so it
can safely be presumed that he had the knowledge and that he
was in exclusive control of the motorcar and the contraband
therein. Though the defence tried its best to convince this Court
in respect of the contradictions so made and to reap its benefits,
but the contradictions pointed out were not only minor but
trivial in nature which could not shake the structure so raised.
The complainant who was examined as PW-2, stood the test of
cross-examination, but noting disadvantageous could be
brought from his mouth. The Investigating Officer was
examined as PW-5, who conducted the investigation and
interrogated the accused. This witness was thoroughly cross
examined on material aspects of the case, but nothing

detrimental could be brought out to favour the appellant. He
went on to say that during investigation, he recorded the
statement of the Moharrir in respect of the safe custody of the
case property and that he also recorded the statement’ of
constable Imdad Ullah, who took the samples to the office of
Chemical Examiner and in both the cases i.e..in respect of the
case property certificate No.784/21.and in respect of the test
samples route certificate bearing No.909/21 was placed on file.
The Investigating Officer further stated that he collected the
daily diaries No.34 dated 06.9.2017 and No.48 dated 07.9.2017,
showing the departure and arrival of the complainant (SHO) to
the Police Station. The record depicts that the evidence
collected by the prosecution has fully connected the accused
with commission of the offence and it was then the accused to

prove his innocence as is held in case reported as Kashif Amir

Vs. The State (2010 SCMR 1052(b), that:

“Another aspect of the case is that once the
prosecution has prima facie established its case
then under section 29 of the CNSA burden shifts
upon the accused to prove contrary to the plea of
the prosecution”.

7. In offences under the Control of Narcotics
Substance Act, 1997, the prosecution is duty bound to prove
the safe transmission of test samples and that the case property
was in safe custody, furthermore, the witnesses were produced
who explained that how the test samples were transmitted and
the case property was retained in safe custody. In the present
case, the prosecution made all efforts to do complete justice

with the case and as such all efforts were made to collect the

material evidence in this respect. The Moharrir, in whose
custody the remaining case property was lying was produced
alongwith the police constable, who took the test-samples to the
office of the Chemical Examiner, they were put to searching

cross-examination, but their veracity could not be shattered.

8. The prosecution witnesses remained consistent
on all aspects of the case and even the safe custody of the case
property in the police station has been established as in that
respect, the concerned Moharrir was produced and examined.
Even the prosecution produced one Imdad Ullah, who took the
test samples to the Forensic Science Laboratory, who was
thoroughly cross examined but nothing was brought from this

witness to favour the appellant.

9. For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, we feel
no hesitation to- hold that the learned trial Court after
scrutinizing the prosecution evidence has rightly convicted the
appellant, therefore, the impugned judgment, being based on
sound reasons asks for no interference. Resultantly, this appeal

being devoid of merit stands dismissed.

Announced.
