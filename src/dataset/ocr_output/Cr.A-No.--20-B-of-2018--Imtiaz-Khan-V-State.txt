13.12.2015 registered U/S.302/109/34 PPC at PS, Pezu, District,

10:10 hours in injured condition at Rural Health Center Tittar

Khel reported the matter vide murasila EX.PA/1 to the effect that

on the eventful day Imtiaz (appellant), his friend, called him that

that he is waiting for him at the shop of one Sattar ““Pulaw Ferosh”,

thus, he must reached there forthwith. Complainant reached there,

where Imtiaz and his father Abdul Farid were present. After

eating “Pulaw” at the said shop, they all reached near Basic

Health Unit Dara Pezu at 09:00 hours, complainant and Imtiaz

suddenly exchanged hot words and grappled, and meanwhile,

Abdul Farid father of appellant commanded his son Imtiaz to kill,

thereby Imtiaz took out his pistol from the trouser fold and fired at

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
complainant with intention to commit his Qatl-e-amad, who

resultantly got hit, seriously injured and fell down. Accused

decamped from the crime venue. No previous motive was

advanced except the altercation and quarrel between the

complainant and appellant. On the initial murasila report of

complainant, the FIR was registered U/S. 324/109/34 PPC, but

after expiry of the complainant Section-302 PPC was inserted in

the FIR.

It is to be mentioned here that SHO of concerned PS

after exchange of firing along with Kalashnikov with fitted

magazine containing ten live cartridges, spare magazine

containing 25 live cartridges of 7.62 bore and a .30 bore pistol

10. Fazal Rehman brother of deceased then injured

appeared as PW-6, on the day of incident at the relevant time had

seen Muhammad Usman along with Imtiaz and Abdul Farid

accused. H narrated that at about 09:00 hours, he heard fire shots,

rushed there and found his brother Muhammad Usman disclosing

that he was fired at by the accused Imtiaz with his pistol on the

command of his father, he rushed the injured to RHC Tittar Khel

for medical treatment, there the local police came to whom the

injured narrated the matter. He verified the signature of his

brother on the murasila. The injured was then shifted to D.I.Khan,

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
who on the way succumbed to the injuries, thus, the dead body

was returned to RHC Tittar Khel . He identified the dead body of

the deceased before the doctor and the site-plan Ex.PB was

prepared by the I.O at his pointation. He also witnessed the

recovery memo: E.PW-6/1 and Ex.PW-6/2 vide which blood-

were preserved by the I.O.

11. Zairi Gul ASI/Investigating Officer appeared as

PW-7, carried out complete investigation in the instant case while

Farman Khan SHO appeared as PW-8 who submitted complete

challan against the accused.

12- After closure of prosecution evidence the accused

was examined U/S. 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the allegations

of the prosecution and stated that he was innocent and had falsely

been implicated. However, he neither opted to be examined on

Oath nor produced defence.

13- On the conclusion of trial the accused were

convicted and sentenced as stated above.

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
14- The learned counsels for the parties were heard at

length and with their precious assistance the record was read from

cover to cover.

15- The incident occurred at 09:00 AM, when the

deceased was allegedly called on his mobile cell by the appellant

and his father namely, Abdul Farid. The deceased as per his

statement came to them and chit chat started where after the

accused asked him to follow and as such they reached to the place

where the tragedy was enacted. The report of the deceased which

was allegedly taken vide murasila Ex.PA/1 explains the situation

that initially the parties talked to each-other and gradually

altercation started accused/appellant pulled out his pistol from the

fold of his Shalwar and fired at the deceased. The overall situation

does not appeal to a prudent mind that, when no motive was

alleged then what need was felt by the co-accused to accompany

his son to the place and to meet the deceased. It looks abnormal

that in absence of any strong motive, father would command his

son to kill. The report of the deceased is silent regarding the

presence of PW-6 Fazal Rehman at the time of occurrence, had he

been present his name would find mention in the report. Fazal

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
Rehman latter on introduced himself as eye-witness, and stated

that when the deceased received Fire-arm injuries, he rushed

towards the injured, who told him that he was fired upon by the

appellant/accused commanded by his father. This witness further

stated that the deceased then injured pointed the specific places of

the accused at the time of firing. The story took another turn when

PW-3 Javed Khan SHO came forward and stated that he was

around the place of occurrence, when he heard fire shots, he

rushed to the place where the deceased then injured was lying on

the ground, who narrated the events to him and pointed out the

way accused had fled. This witness further stated that on the spot

he saw PW-Fazal Rehman and also make arrangements for

shifting the injured to the hospital and himself with other police

officials ran after the accused. PW-3 further stated that they were

chasing the accused and it was a little distance from the spot that

accused turn around and opened indiscriminate firing on the

police party, the accused was shown arrested and a .30 bore pistol

with live cartridges and a Kalashnikov was recovered from his

immediate possession and a case FIR No. 469 dated 13.12.2015

U/S. 324/353 PPC/ 15 AA was registered. We are surprised to see

that the accused/appellant after firing at the deceased then injured

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
when ran away and admittedly the police in a hot pursuit arrested

him near the place of occurrence then how the Kalashnikov came

to his hands when he had left the spot with a .30 bore pistol in

hand. Two things has added to our anxiety, one that if the report

of the deceased then injured was taken to be correct the SHO

finds mention nowhere and the other than when the appellant was

arrested there and then how the other weapons came to his

possession, what can we gather from is that the witnesses are

telling a lie and the weapons recovered were planted with the sole

purpose to make the prosecution case a success and this stance is

further belied by the age of accused/appellant being of 15 years as

in such a tender age this act of retaliation cannot be expected.

16- The presence of PW-6 on spot is not established, as

established on one hand this witness was not named in the report

whereas on the other he admittedly rans a service station situated

in Lakki Cement Factory. The time of incident is 09:00 AM, so he

must have been present at the place of his business, his presence

on or around the spot at the time of occurrence is unnatural and

we feel no hesitation, but to hold that this witness was a chance

witness.

The apex court in case titled Muhammad Ashraf

alias Acchu Versus the State (2019 SCMR 652) held:-

"It is well-settled that benefit of
slightest doubt must go to an accused and ina
case where the court reaches a conclusion that
the eye-witnesses were chance witnesses, they
had not witnessed the occurrence and the
prosecution story is concocted by the PWs,
then the case of accused merits plane

acquittal"

17- The entire case of prosecution hinges upon the
dying declaration. The prosecution was duty bound to prove that
in fact the deceased was well oriented in time and space and that
all legal precautions were taken while the scribe was scribing his
report. This is on record that the deceased in injured condition
was taken to hospital, where the scribe PW-4 reached at 10:08
AM and prepared his injury sheet. This PW-4 was thoroughly
cross-examined, but when a particular question was put to him
that why he did not obtain a fitness certificate from the doctor
regarding the capability of the injured to speak, his reply was
strange that he did not feel the need. This is on record that at the
time of report, the doctor was also present in the emergency room

and this was one of the legal requirements that a fitness certificate

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
11

should have been requested and the doctor should have endorsed

the murasila, but this legal requirement was willfully ignored

which leads us to a conclusion that in fact the injured was brought

by the local people and was unable to talk and lateron the eye-

witness was procured and the report was taken down. The doctor

who was examined as PW-5 was cross-examined, who while

replying in respect of entry wound No.1, stated that injury No.1

and 2 the muscle of the tongue got detached from mandible bone,

the mandible bone was fractured and this situation directly affect

the speech, so when all these things are placed together, it comes

out that the deceased then injured was not in a position to talk and

as such the so-called dying declaration cannot be taken a report

made by the deceased.

The apex court in case titled Tahir Khan Versus

the State (2011 SCMR 646) held:-

"It is thus absolutely clear from the
principles laid-down by this court that dying
declaration is a weaker type of evidence which
needs corroboration and that conviction can
be based on the basis of such a declaration
when fully corroborated by the other reliable
evidence. Thus the facts and circumstances of

each case have to be kept in view and also the

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
12

credibility, reliability and acceptability of such

a declaration, by the court. "

18- The prosecution stressed the recovery of pistol from

accused and six empties of .30 bore from the place of occurrence,

which matched together and to them was sufficient for conviction.

It is pertinent to mention that allegedly the appellant was arrested

in hot pursuit and a .30 bore pistol along with a Kalashnikov was

recovered from the appellant after exchange of heavy firing. PW-

3 Javed SHO who is also scribe of the report in that respect stated

that the pistol recovered from possession of appellant/accused was

sealed on the spot and was handed-over to the investigating

officer of case FIR No.469. There is mystery all around that when

and at what time, the pistol was handed over to PW-7 Zairi Gul

ASI when admittedly this SHO did not meet the investigating

officer at 1:30 PM on the spot. Our anxiety increased that whether

it was the pistol used by the appellant in commission of the

offence and recovered from the possession of the appellant ? We

safely hold it “No” for the reason that the recovered pistol was

stated to be sealed at the time of recovery and this pistol was

produced in unsealed condition to the I.O which speaks nothing,

but malafide on part of the prosecution and fabrication. The pistol

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
13

along with empties were sent to FSL where these articles were

received on 22.12.2015 after a delay of ten days, but this delay

has never been explained that where these articles were lying for

these long ten days and even the Muharrir of the Malkhana and

the constable who took it to the office of Chemical Examiner were

not examined.

The apex court in case titled Muhammad Ashraf

alias Acchu Versus the State (2019 SCMR 652) held:-

"After scrutiny of evidence, it has been
observed by us that no such corroboration is
available on record because the empties
secured from the spot and the .30 bore pistol
allegedly recovered from the possession of
appellant at the time of his arrest were sent to
the office of FSL on the same day, i.e, on
21.3.2002, after the arrest of the appellant on
23.01.2002. In these circumstances, the report
of FSL cannot be relied and is legally

inconsequential."

19- The record is silent that what led to the death of the

deceased, as no motive was given. The ages, i.e, of the deceased

19 years, and of the accused 15/16 years, lead us to draw an

inference that in fact the matter between the two was something

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr.Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah
14

which none was ready to disclose for the purpose better known to
them, but either side made a conscious attempt to suppress the

truth.

Be that as it may the prosecution failed to convince

this court that it was non-else but accused who killed the deceased.

20- After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file this court reaches to a conclusion that the prosecution has
miserably failed to prove its case against accused/appellant.
Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed, the conviction and
sentence of the appeal recorded by the learned trial court is set-
aside and he is acquitted of the charge by extending him the
benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth with from jail, if not

required to be detained in connection with any other case.

21- These are the detailed reasons of my short order of

the even date.
