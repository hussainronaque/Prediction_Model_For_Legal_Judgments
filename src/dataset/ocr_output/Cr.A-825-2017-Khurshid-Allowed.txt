JUDGMENT

FRR RK

AHMAD ALT, J. Questioned herein is the judgment of
learned Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court, Swabi, dated
23.11.2017, whereby appellant Khurshid s/o Muhammad
Qasam, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment
with fine of Rs.200,000/ in case FIR No.787 dated
28.11.2016 registered against him u/s 9© CNSA, 1997 at

Police Station, Kalu Khan (District Swabi).

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant/Tariq
Nisar Khan, ASI/PW1 alongwith other police officials,
during mobile gusht received information that proclaimed
offender (Khurshid, hereinafter the appellant) in case FIR
No.370 dated 20.06.2016 u/s 302/34 PPC PS Jabbar
Mardan was present in a rented house, he rushed the spot
with the other police officials where the accused was

present in the courtyard of said house duly armed with a
pistol 9-MM bore No. To 62010H 1809, alongwith holster
containing two spare chargers and 29 cartridges. The
Accused-appellant was arrested. There was a motorbike
Honda black color, 125-cc bearing registration No. RIQ-
4644, having two black color bags tied thereon. On search,
the bags were found to have contained 24 packets charas,
each packet was 1000 grams and total 24 kgs charas were
recovered. Out of the recovered contraband 5/5 grams
were separated for chemical analysis by FSL, sealed in
parcels No.1 to 24, remaining stuff i.e.23880 grams
(23.880 kgs) were packet and sealed in parcel No.25. The
Contraband and vehicle etc were taken into possession
vide recovery memo Ex.PW1/1. On the basis of murasila
Ex.PA/1, FIR (Ex.PA) was registered against the accused-
appellant.

2. On completion of investigation, challan was
submitted in Court where the appellant was charge sheeted
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution in order to prove its case, produced and
examined as many as three (03) witnesses whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded, wherein, he
professed his innocence. The learned Trial Court, after
conclusion of trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge
and, while recording his conviction, sentenced him as
mentioned above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has

filed the instant appeal before this Court.
3. Arguments heard and record gone through.

4. Allegation against the appellant is that he was
proclaimed offender in case FIR No.370 dated 20.06.2016
u/s 302/34 PPC PS Jabbar Mardan, but at the time of his
arrest in the above mentioned case from his rented house,
24 kgs charas were recovered from two bags tied on a
motorbike which was being parked in the said house.

5. Perusal of record reveals that there is no such FIR
available on file or exhibited by the prosecution so as to
affirm the fact that actually the accused was a proclaimed
offender. There is nothing on record with regard to
ownership of the alleged rented house or any lease
agreement to suggest and substantiate the stance of
complainant/PW1 as to whether the said house was rented
to accused-appellant. Similar is the position of motorbike
in this regard. To clear the happening, relevant portions of
the statements of PW1 and PW2, recorded in cross
examination, are reproduced below for ready reference:-

“I was neither in possession of copy of
FIR 370 which is referred to by me in
the murasila nor the same was received
by me from Police Station Jabbar
District Mardan or from Police Station
Kalu Khan ......... The motorbike was
available inside the spot house. It is
correct that no documents regarding
the ownership of motorbike was
recovered from the accused. It would
be in the knowledge of the ILO however
in my presence the statements of people
of the locality were not recorded at that
time. It is correct that regarding the
inmates of the house including the
women folk or children there is
nothing mentioned in the murasila as
to whether they were available or not.
The witness volunteered that there was
only one female available in the said
house whose name I do not know. It is
correct that even I do not know
relationship of that lady with the
accused........0 it is correct that driving
license was not recovered from the
possession of the accused”

“In my presence the IO has not
recorded the statement of any person
regarding the ownership of the aid
house. It is correct that no document
regarding the ownership of the
motorcycle was recovered from accused
o show the connection of the accused
with the above noted motorbike”.

From the above observations and statements of two
important PWs, it reveals that prosecution has not
established any connectivity of the accused with the
alleged recovery of contraband effected from motorbike
parked in the so called rented house. Another obtrusive
issue of the case is that no warrant of arrest of the
competent Court in the former FIR, if any, has not been
brought on record by prosecution.

6. In present case against the appellant, the record
suggests that safe custody of the recovered substance as
well as safe transmission of samples of the recovered
substance to the FSL had not been established by the
prosecution. The Complainant/Seizing Officer/PW1 has
though deposed in his Court’s statement that he took into
position the contraband, but it is not clear from his
statement that to whom he handed over the remaining
contraband except the stance that “J myself have taken the

accused and other articles to the police station”. Conversely,
PW2 deposed in terms that “‘the case property and the accused
were handed over to me by the I.0 and I myself took the accused

and the case property to the police station”. The
complainant/PW1 further deposed that he prepared the
samples for FSL, but from his statement it is not clear that
to whom he handed over the samples for taking to FSL.
PW3 narrated that the samples were sent to FSL by the
Moharrir on 30.11.2016, but without disclosing the name
of official who took the same to FSL. Now come to the
FSL report Ex.PK which indeed shows that FC1075 took
the samples to FSL on 02.12.2016. Surprisingly, both
these important witnesses i.e. Moharrir and FC1075,
being associated with the recovered contraband at the
relevant time, were not produced before the Trial Court by
the prosecution. So, adverse inference under Article
129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 could be drawn.
There is no record or assertion that the samples and case
property were ever kept in Malkhana. Had it been, the
Register No.19 would have been examined. In this
situation, the safe custody of the samples and case
property is not proved. Guidance could be sought from
case law reported in 2019 SCMR 608 wherein it was held

by the apex Court that;

“In a case where safe custody of the
recovered substance or safe
transmission of samples of the
recovered substance was not proved by
the prosecution through independent

evidence, it could not be concluded that
the prosecution had succeeded in
establishing its case against the

accused beyond reasonable doubt’.

Similar views have also been taken by the apex court in

2018 SCMR 2039, & 2019 SCMR 903.

Furthermore, record is silent as to where remained the
samples and case property from 28.11.2016 to 02.12.2016
when it was received in FSL with a considerable and un-

explained delay of 4/5 days. In case titled “Ikramullah

and others Vs the State reported in 2015 SCMR 1002” it
has also been held by the apex Court that;

“No such police official was produced before
Trial Court to depose about safe custody of
samples entrusted to him for being deposited
in office of Chemical Examiner---Prosecution
was not able to establish that after alleged
recovery of substance so recovered was either
kept in safe custody or that samples were
taken from recovered substance had safely
been transmitted to office of Chemical
Examiner without the same being tampered
with or replaced while in transit---Prosecution
failed to prove its case against accused
persons beyond reasonable doubt”

Likewise, in case reported in 2012 SCMR 577 it has also
been held by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that;

“Although prosecution sought to corroborate
testimony of recovery witnesses with report of
Forensic Science Laboratory to the effect that
contraband item recovered from secret
cavities were charas, yet sanctity of report of
Laboratory was eroded by evidence of official
who could not be correctly reply as to where
samples remained between the dates when

those were allegedly taken into possession
JSrom car and the date those were received by

Forensic Science Laboratory ”.

7. In present case, where the recovery is doubtful and
safe custody of the recovered substance as well as safe
transmission of the samples thereof is not established by
the prosecution through cogent evidence, there it cannot
be said that the prosecution had proved its case against the
accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

8. Keeping in view the contradictions on material
points occurred in the statements of PWs and handling
of the contraband as hinted above created doubts in the
prosecution case qua its recovery and safe custody,
which suggests that occurrence has not taken place in

the mode and manner as alleged by the prosecution.

9. The above discussion has led this Court to believe
that the learned trial court has erred in appreciating the
case evidence in its true perspective. It has been held,
time and again by the superior courts, that a slightest
doubt occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to grant
acquittal to an accused. The conclusions drawn by the
learned trial Court are not borne out of the case evidence

therefore, the impugned judgment is not sustainable.

10. For what has been discussed above, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and the

appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled against him.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other
case.

11. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
Announced.
