Mr. Muhammad Riaz Khan, AAG .........for Official respondents.

eA
MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J:-Through this constitutional

petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan 1973, the petitioner has assailed the order
dated 11.02.2016, of learned Member-II of Board of Revenue,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, (Respondent No.59), whereby the
revision petition bearing No.61/MBR-II/2012, filed by petitioner
was dismissed.

2. Facts, which are relevant for decision of this petition
are that the petitioner had purchased property, measuring 4
Kanal 7 % Marlas, on the basis of Mutation No.10107, dated
19.03.1996, from one Mst Tasleem Begum daughter of
Muhammad Sarwar Khan wife of Sirajud-Din Khan, regarding
which Mst Faima begum filed partition application for
separation of her share, before Revenue Officer, on 30.07.1996.
In the application for partition, petitioner was not impleaded
and, ultimately, the partition application filed by Mst Faima
Begum was allowed and the property was ordered to be

partitioned. Petitioner has submitted an application for setting
aside of partition decree and mutation No.10506, on the ground
that at the time of filing of partition application, he was owner
but was not impleaded in partition application, even otherwise
neither he was informed through any mean nor any notice was
ever issued, therefore, the entire process of partition proceeding
was against the law, so, the same may be set aside and he should
be impleaded. The application was contested and, vide order
date 14.12.2010, his application was turned down, against which
the petitioner filed an appeal before District Revenue Officer,
Charsadda, where through an order dated 12.02.2011, the appeal
filed by the petitioner was allowed and partition proceedings
along with mutation were set aside. The order of DRO dated
12.02.2011 was challenged by Mst Taraja Begum (respondent
No.1) before Additional Commissioner, Peshawar, Camp Court
Charsadda, who through his order dated 11.02.2016, allowed the
revision filed by respondent No.1 and set aside the order of

DRO, however, he at the end of his order mentioned that;

“Arguments and record perused. Record
shows that partition proceedings had been
completed on 04.07.2000. After sufficient long
time the present respondent has approached
the trial Court, which after hearing both
parties have rejected the application of the
present respondent. Record also further shows
that share as per revenue record has also been
allotted to the present respondent in the
partition mutation and has not been deprived
from his due share. Keeping in view the above
the order of learned DOR Charsadda dated
12.02.2012 is hereby set aside while the order
of the trial Court dated 14.12.2010 is upheld.
However, to meet the ends of justice the trial
Court is directed to call both the parties and
give a chance of hearing to the present
respondents and thereafter if necessary make
amendment in the partition proceeding strictly
according to law within a month time. Revision
petition to this extent is accepted.”
The petitioner being not satisfied, has filed the
revision petition before Board of Revenue, KPK, Peshawar,

where his revision petition was dismissed, hence, this petition.

3. Heard and record perused.
4. Undeniably, the petitioner was the owner in the

property, which was subject matter of the partition, measuring
630 Kanan and 5 Marlas, vide Mutation No.10107, attested on
19.03.2016, his vendor was Mst Tasleem Begum, who was the
owner in column of ownership. It is also evident from the
revenue paper for the year 1919-92 (Ex.PW1/1) that this
partition application was filed after attestation of mutation in
favour of petitioner. It could not be said that respondents (Mst
Taraja Begum or Mst Faima Begum) were not aware from this
fact because Ex PW1/1 was placed on record by Mst Faima
Begum. Section 135 of Land Revenue Act deals with the
partition of agriculture property, which for convenience is
reproduced as under: -

“Section-135 Application for partition. Any
joint owner of land may apply to a Revenue
Officer for partition of his share in the land
if: -

(a) at the date of application, the share is
recorded under Chapter vi as belonging to
him, or

(b) His right to the share has been established
by a decree which is till subsisting at that
date, or

(c) A written acknowledgement of that right
has been executed by all persons interested
in the admission or denial thereof.”

5. There is no cavil with proposition that for the
purpose of partition not only the owners should be the party to
partition application but the entire joint property should be
partitioned and could not be allowed to pick and choose a

particular khasra number or Khata number (field number or
holding) and to exclude the others, as partial partition is not
permissible. Likewise, without impleading a person/owner in the
application for partition, the procedure adopted would be against
the principle of natural justice and common law as well, and
would not be allowed to give effect. The Revenue officer for
dismissing the application has made the limitation as one of the
ground which was not justified as limitation would be
considered in case when the petitioner would have been party.
As he was not party and contended no knowledge, then the

limitation shall be considered from the date of knowledge.

6 In case titled Mst Asia Rizi and others Vs Mian

Muhammad Khan and others (2019 CLC 1333), it was held
that:

“In addition to supra, plaintiff in a suit is
dominus litis who may choose persons against
whom he wishes to litigate and he cannot be
compelled to sue a person against whom he
does not seek any relief and necessary party
is a person who must be joined as party and
in whose absence no effective decree can be
passed at all by the Court. If a necessary
party is not impleaded the suit itself is liable
to be dismissed. Proper party is a person
whose presence enables court to completely,
effectively and adequately adjudicate upon
all matters in dispute in suit, though he is not
a person in favour of or against whom decree
is to be passed. In the present case, as has
been referred above, the respondent No.26
purchased the land from respondents Nos.18
to 25 and there is nothing on record to
suggest that the land was partitioned prior to
his purchase and it is settled principle of law
that if a person purchases a land out of joint
holding, he becomes a co-owner in the
holding along with other co-owners and if the
purchaser gets the possession of any land
from the joint holding, such possession is
always subject to the partition of Khata.”

7. Legally, partition of property means to bring
proceeding in the Court to force the physical division of

property or to get separate the shares of any joint owner from the

joint property. Partition is normally commenced by one of the
co-owner, filing an application before the Court of competent
jurisdiction by impleading all the joint owners. Any person with
an existing interest in the property may bring the action for
partition and vice-versa against whom the partition is sought. By
not impleading petitioner in partition application, irrespective of
his share, would render the entire process in nullity.

8. This Court in case titled Mst Waziran Mian

through legal heirs and 29 others Vs Riaz Ahmed and 3

others (2011 YLR 1327), it was held that:

“In the instant case the entire khata No.355
has been divided into four new khatas. As is
evident from the record the entire khata was
owned by numerous other persons besides
parties to the present suit and all of them
might have been benefited or injuriously
affected with partition Mutation No.1125,
for the reason by creating newly khata
No.384 with regard to "Dakhelkari"
(hereditary occupancy). The case of Allah
Baldish etc, applicants before the appellate
Court is glaring example of the above
mentioned proposition, who were not party
before the Court but have been deprived of
their property through impugned
judgments/decrees.”

9. The petitioner being owner of the property was
required to be impleaded as a party in the application and in
whose absence no effective decree could be passed. Even
otherwise, his undeniable rights to defend himself could not be
snatched from him. Therefore, this petition is allowed, partition
application shall be deemed to have been pending before the
Revenue Officer, who shall implead the petitioner in the array of
respondents and, thereafter, proceed ahead and decided

application strictly in accordance with law.
