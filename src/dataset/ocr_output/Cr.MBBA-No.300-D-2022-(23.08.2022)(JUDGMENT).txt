MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALI, J.- Through
the instant petition, the petitioner Manzoor Ahmad
seeks pre-arrest bail in case FIR No.92 dated

21.02.2022 under Section 489-F PPC of Police

Station Paharpur, D.I.Khan.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. The record reflects that earlier the

petitioner had submitted an application for bail
before arrest (BBA) in the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Paharpur (D.I.Khan).
He was granted ad-interim pre-arrest bail vide

order dated 22.02.2022 but on 26.5.2022, his BBA

are es

petition was rejected/dismissed because of his
absence. Subsequently he filed bail before arrest
petition bearing Cr.MBBA.No.226-D/2022 before
this Court which was disposed of vide order dated
03.6.2022 in terms that the petitioner may
approach the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Paharpur (D.I.Khan) to give explanation of his
absence on the date fixed before the Court in the
earlier BBA in view of latest pronouncements of
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Shazaib and others Vs. The State” (PLD 2021
S.C. 886) and “Inamullah Vs. The State” (PLD
2021 S.C. 892). Thereafter the petitioner submitted
another BBA petition before the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Paharpur (D.I.Khan)
which too was dismissed on 30.6.2022 because of
his absence as well as on merit. Then the petitioner
again approached this Court for bail before arrest
and submitted Cr.MBBA.No.275-D/2022. On
05.7.2022, after arguing the case at some length,
the learned counsel representing the petitioner
requested for withdrawal of BBA petition in the
light of ibid referred judgments of august Apex

Court and the same was disposed of accordingly.

4. It appears from the record that instead

of approaching the Court of learned Additional

a5

Sessions Judge, Paharpur (D.I.Khan) in line with
his request and order dated 05.7.2022 of this Court
in Cr.MBBA.No.275-D/2022, the petitioner, by
taking benefit of summer vacations, filed bail
before arrest petition bearing Cr.MBBA.No.2179-
P/2022 at Principal Seat of this Court and obtained
ad-interim pre-arrest bail vide order dated
20.7.2022 without disclosing the factum of
previous BBA petition and the said petition was

sent to this Court for disposal.

5. Whether after withdrawal of first
BBA petition the petitioner can file a second
petition for the same relief? The accused can
approach the same Court with a fresh pre-arrest
bail petition if the earlier one has been withdrawn
without advancing arguments on merits. However,
the Court must be watchful that the successive
petition is not readily entertained or the concession
of ad interim bail granted to the accused, unless he
furnishes satisfactory explanation for withdrawal
of the first petition and filing of the second one;
otherwise, an unscrupulous accused can abuse the
process of Court for ulterior purposes. My reliance
is upon the case of august Supreme Court of

Pakistan titled “Snamuilah Vs. The State”

mle

reported in (PLD 2021 SC. 892), in which it was
held that:--

“While the accused can approach the
same court with a fresh pre-arrest bail
petition if the earlier one has been
withdrawn without advancing
arguments on merits, the court must be
watchful that the successive petition is
not readily entertained or the
concession of ad interim bail granted
to the accused, unless he furnishes
satisfactory explanation for withdrawal
of the first petition and filing of the
second one; otherwise, an
unscrupulous accused can abuse the
process of court for ulterior purposes.
Therefore, the accused must be
required by the court to furnish
satisfactory explanation for
withdrawing the first pre-arrest bail
petition at the time of entertaining the
second pre-arrest bail petition. Unless
there is satisfactory explanation, the
second bail petition should not be
entertained, because otherwise the
accused would have an unchecked
license to abuse the concession of ad
interim pre-arrest bail by misusing the
court-process, and hoodwink the
Police to prolong the investigation.
Therefore, while the accused has
access to courts to seek pre-arrest bail,
even successively for justifiable
reasons, he cannot be permitted to
abuse the concession of ad interim bail
to stall the investigation and play hide
and seek with the criminal justice
system. In case the accused fails to
give satisfactory explanation for his
withdrawal of the earlier pre-arrest bail
petition and the need for filing the
fresh one, his second or successive
pre-arrest bail petition shall not be
maintainable.”

Similarly in the case of “Muhammad

Sadiq and others Vs. The State and another”

(2015 S C M R 1394)”, following observations

were made:-
-5-

“If one fails to prove any mala fide
or ulterior motive in the first pre-
arrest bail petition before the
learned Additional Sessions, Judge
or before the learned High Court
then the only remedy available to
him is of challenging the said order
before this Court or before the
learned High Court in case the bail
before arrest is declined by the
learned Sessions Court. Filing of
pre-arrest bail petitions again and
again amounts to misuse of law and
it also increases the backlog of the
Courts and this growing trend
should have to be stopped by the
learned Courts below. When the
second application was withdrawn
by the learned counsel for the
petitioners, the petitioners could not
avail the said remedy even after the
deletion of section 365, P.P.C. by
the investigating officer as it had
attained finality but the petitioners
adopted the policy of hide and seek
by moving a number of
applications.”

The principle so enunciated has been
further glorified in the case of “Inamullah Vs. The
State” (PLD 2021 S.C. 892), wherein it was held
by august Apex Court that:-

“Unless there is satisfactory
explanation, the second bail
petition should not be entertained,
because otherwise the accused
would have an unchecked license
to abuse the concession of ad
interim pre-arrest bail by misusing
the court-process, and hoodwink
the Police to prolong the
investigation. Therefore, while the
accused has access to Courts to
seek pre-arrest bail, even
successively for justifiable
reasons, he cannot be permitted to
abuse the concession of ad interim
bail to stall the investigation and

-6-

play hide and seek with the

criminal justice system. In case

the accused fails to give

satisfactory explanation for his

withdrawal of the earlier pre-arrest

bail petition and the need for filing

the fresh one, his second or

successive pre-arrest bail petition

shall not be maintainable.”
6. In this view of the matter, the
petitioner after withdrawal of his first BBA petition
from this Court could not have filed the second
BBA petition without any solid explanation,
inasmuch as he has not even disclosed in the
instant petition the withdrawal of earlier BBA
petition filed by him before this Court and in this
view of the matter this Court granted ad-interim
pre-arrest bail to him on 20.7.2022, as the record

was not before the Court, therefore, the same is not

entertainable.

7. Section 498-A, Cr.P.C. creates a
statutory fetter or a statutory precondition
requiring the presence of the petitioner in person
in Court for the exercise of jurisdiction by the
Court for granting pre-arrest bail. In case the
petitioner/accused is not personally present
before the Court, the Court is not authorized to
grant him even an interim bail and the petition is
to be dismissed for his lack of presence in Court.

Once the petitioner is granted interim bail but he
offs

does not appear on the date fixed, the Court has
ample powers to dismiss the petition for non-
prosecution. However, in case some explanation
is furnished for his nonappearance, the Court
may, if it finds the explanation to be satisfactory,
exempt his presence for that day and adjourn the
hearing of the petition for a short period. In the
absence of the personal appearance of the
petitioner, the Court cannot travel further into the
case and examine the merits of the case. In fact
the examination of the merits of the case in the
absence of the accused totally defeats the intent
and purpose of the statutory provision of Section
498, Cr.P.C. This is because once the Court
proceeds to examine the merits of the case, then
the Court has the option to either dismiss or
allow the bail petition, while under Section 498-
A, Cr.P.C. the Court is not authorized to admit

the accused to bail in his absence.

8. It would also be relevant that before
insertion of Section 498-A in the Cr.P.C., once a
petition for pre-arrest bail was admitted for
hearing and notice given to the State, it had to be
decided on merits despite absence of the
petitioner on the date fixed for hearing the

petition. However, after the insertion of Section
aie

498-A in the Cr.P.C., there were divergent views
on this point: one set of judgments still retain the
said view, while the other set of cases hold the
view that the petition for pre-arrest bail is to be
dismissed if the petitioner is not present in Court
on the date fixed for hearing of the petition and it
is not to be decided on merits in his absence,
unless the Court exempts his presence. However,
the apex Court disapproved the earlier view for
the reason that true import and meaning of
Section 498-A, Cr.P.C. was not taken therein. It
is by now well settled that once the BBA petition
is dismissed for non-appearance of the accused,
the petitioner can file a fresh bail petition before
the same Court provided he furnishes sufficient
explanation for his non-appearance in the earlier
bail petition and the Court is satisfied with his
said explanation, however, if he fails to furnish
any satisfactory explanation, his second bail
petition is liable to be dismissed on account of
his conduct of misusing the process of Court
disentitling him to the grant of discretionary

relief of pre-arrest bail.

9. In holding this view I am fortified by

the dicta laid by august Supreme Court of Pakistan

-9-

in Shazaib’s case (supra), wherein it has been held
that:-

“Tt is also clarified that in case the
petition is dismissed for non-
appearance of the accused in a pre-
arrest bail matter under section
498-A, Cr.P.C., the petitioner can
file a fresh bail petition before the
same Court provided that he
furnishes sufficient explanation for
his non-appearance in the earlier
bail petition and the Court is
satisfied with his said explanation.
But if he fails to furnish any
satisfactory explanation, his second
bail petition is liable to be
dismissed on account of his conduct
of misusing the process of Court
disentitling him to the grant of
discretionary relief of pre-arrest
bail.”

It has been further observed in Shazaib’s case
(supra) that the Court cannot dismiss the pre-arrest
bail petition on merits, in addition to dismissing the
same for non-prosecution due to the personal
absence of the petitioner under section 498-A,
Cr.P.C.; and such observations regarding the merits
of the case would not be sustainable in the eye of
law. Further reliance in this regard has been placed

on “Mukhtar Ahmad Vs. State” (2016 SCMR

2064).

10. In the present case, similar directions
were issued by this Court vide order dated
03.6.2022 to learned Additional Sessions Judge,

Paharpur (D.I.Khan) to entertain fresh BBA

-10-

petition of the petitioner and if reasonable
explanation of his absence on the date fixed before
the Court in earlier petition is provided, then the
case will be decided on merit. Though in
compliance of the order, a fresh petition was
entertained and ad-interim pre-arrest bail was
granted to the petitioner but he again remained
absent on 30.6.2022 and submitted an application
through counsel for his exemption from personal
appearance on the ground mentioned therein. But
on the said date, his application for exemption
from personal appearance was rejected and at the
same time his BBA petition was also dismissed on
merits for which the petitioner again approached
this Court by filing Cr.MBBA.No.275-D/2022
which was withdrawn on 05.7.2022 in light of case

law, referred to above.

11. At this juncture, next course of action
available to the petitioner was to approach the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Paharpur
(D.1.Khan) by filing a fresh BBA petition by
explaining the reason for his absence but he filed
the instant petition and obtained ad-interim pre-
arrest bail at Principal Seat of this Court and the
case file was sent to this Court for final decision

wherein all these anomalies were observed by
fe
UF

=ffilis

scanning the entire record of the periodical

petitions for BBA filed by the petitioner.

12. The upshot of the above discussion is
that after withdrawal of first BBA _ petition,
unilaterally, from this Court vide order dated
05.7.2022, by the petitioner, the instant petition is
not entertainable, therefore, the same stands
dismissed and the order dated 20.7.2022 regarding
grant of ad-interim pre-arrest bail to the petitioner
is recalled. However, in the light of above
observations and dicta of the august Apex Court so
referred, the learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Paharpur (D.I.Khan) could not have decided the
BBA petition on merits, therefore, the petitioner is
at liberty to file a fresh BBA petition before the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Paharpur (D.I.Khan) by giving explanation of his
absence before the Court on the date fixed in
earlier BBA petition and after satisfying the Court
with the reasons for his non-appearance, the case
be decided on merits.
