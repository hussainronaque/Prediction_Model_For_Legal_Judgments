JOR
SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Appellant Ghulam Jan was
tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III / Judge
Special Court, District Bannu for the offence under section
9(d) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 2019 in case FIR No.17 dated 19.03.2020 registered with
Police Station Sub-Division Wazir, District Bannu and vide
judgment dated 30.05.2022, the appellant was convicted under
section 9(d) ibid and sentenced to rizorous imprisonment for
life alongwith fine of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lac) or in
default thereof, to undergo 06 months S.I. Benefit under section
382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant / convict. Being

aggrieved, the appellant through the instant appeal has
questioned the legality of the impugned judgment and the
awarded sentence.

2. The transient facts ending in filing of the instant criminal
appeal are that on 19.03.2020, complainant Hafeez-ur-Rehman
SHO (PW-02) alongwith police contingent was on patrol duty
under the supervision of Sher Akbar Khan, Circle Officer, in
the limits of Baran Dam, when at about 17:30, he received spy
information regarding transportation of huge quantity of
narcotics through Mazda Truck bearing Registration No.W-
3133/Peshawar, in response to which, he made barricade at
Bannu — Miran Shah Road; meanwhile, at about 18:20 hours,
the truck rushed there, which was stopped and its driver was
deboarded. Upon query, the driver: disclosed his name as
Ghulam Jan whose physical search went in vain, however,
search of the truck led to recovery of 440 packets of Charas
wrapped in yellow solution tape, from its secret cavities,
beneath its floor. All the 44 packets were weighed separately
and the total quantity came out 55893, grams and from each of
these packets, samples of 10 / 10 grams of Charas were
separated for the purpose of chemical analysis at Forensic
Science Laboratory, while the remaining quantity of 55453
grams was packed and sealed in parcel No.45. The truck

alongwith charas were taken into possession vide recovery
memo Ex.PC. The accused was accordingly arrested vide his
arrest card of even date and murasila report Ex.PB was drafted
and sent to the Police Station through constable Aziz-ur-
Rehman No.76 for registration of the case, hence, the ibid FIR.
3. After completion of investigation, prosecution submitted
complete challan, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as 05 witnesses.
On close of prosecution evidence, statement of appellant /
accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
professed innocence and false implication, however, neither he
opted to be examined on oath as provided under section 340(2)
Cr.P.C nor wished to produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments, the learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment
dated 30.05.2022, convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above. Hence, the instant appeal against the
judgment of conviction.

4. We have heard at length the learned counsel for the
appellant as well as learned Assistant Advocate General
representing the State and gone through the record, with their
valuable assistance.

5. The appellant after having been booked in the instant
case was arrested, the trial commenced and on conclusion of the

trial, the learned trial court was pleased to convict him vide the
impugned judgment for the offence charged. The learned trial
court applied its judicial mind to the collected evidence on file
and after assessing the recorded statenients before it, passed the
impugned judgment. This Court isto see as to whether the
learned trial court appreciated the evidence on file and as to
whether the impugned judgment is the outcome of application
of judicial mind, to the facts and circumstances of the case.
There is no denial of the fact that unde the Act, for commission
of the offence, stringent punishment is provided and that when
the punishment is severe then the prosecution is equally
burdened with the liability to prove the charges against the
accused to the hilt. In the present case, the prosecution
examined as many as 05 ‘witnesses’ and to ascertain as to
whether the learned trial judge was justified to convict the
appellant, we feel it essential to revisit and re-appreciate the
evidence, once appreciated, so that miscarriage of justice could
be avoided.

6. It was on 19.03.2020 that cn spy information, the
complainant alongwith police officials made barricade at the
place of incident and after some time, the truck in question
approached to the spot, which was signaled to stop and the
driver was deboarded therefrom. The truck was searched, which

led to the recovery of 44 packets cf charas from its secret
cavities. The accused was arrested and copy of murasila was
sent to the Police Station, which was incorporated in the present
F.LR. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant, prepared the site plan. After
completion of the proceedings on the spot, the case property
was handed over by the complainant to the Investigating
Officer.

7. In support of its claim, the prsecution, among others,
examined the complainant as PW-02, who stated that on the day
of incident, while on patrol duty, he received information from
an informer that a Mazda Truck bearing Registration
No.W3133/Peshawar is trafficking huge quantity of narcotics;
that after receiving the information, He made barricade on the
spot and waited for arrival of the vehicle; when the vehicle
reached to the spot, it was signaled to stop, which was
accordingly stopped; the driver upon query disclosed his name
as Ghulam Jan; on search of the vehicle, 44 packets of Charas
constituting a quantity of 55893 gran's in toto were recovered
from its secret cavities. This witness was cross-examined by the
defense, but nothing detrimental to the prosecution case could
be extracted from his mouth. The witness was examined
regarding his arrival on the spot, the manner in which the

vehicle was signaled to stop and the mode of recovery from the
vehicle. In order to know as to whether the complainant was
telling the whole truth and as to whether the incident occurred
in the mode, manner and the stated tithe, we feel it essential to
go through the statement of Aziz-ur-Rahman No.76 (PW-04),
who accompanied the complainant from the Police Station to
the spot and that in his presence, the recoveries were effected
from the vehicle. This witness was cross-examined on material
aspects of the case, but he remainel consistent to what the
complainant stated. The manner in which the complainant left
the Police Station is fully supported by the marginal witness
and even the manner in which the recoveries were effected from
the vehicle.

8. The investigating officer was examined as PW-05, who,
inter alia, stated that on receiving copy of the F.IR, he visited
the spot; that on reaching to the spot, he was handed over by the
complainant sealed parcels No.1 to 44 each containing 10
grams charas for the purpose of chemical analysis by the
Forensic Science Laboratory and jiarcel No.45 containing
55453 grams of charas recovered from the accused / appellant;
that he took into possession the same alongwith the truck vide
recovery memo ExPW-5/1 duly attested by marginal witnesses;
that he prepared site plan at the instance of the complainant and

the statements of the witnesses. were recorded. The
investigating officer was cross examined on material aspects of
the case, but nothing detrimental could be brought on record to
shatter the prosecution case. Muharrir of the police station was
examined as PW-01 on 29.09.2020 followed by his re-
examination as RPW-01 on 15°01.2022, The witness
categorically stated that it was he who incorporated the contents
of murasila into FIR Ex:PW-1/1 after receiving the murasila
from SHO Hafeez-ur-Rehman through constable Aziz-ur-
Rehman No.76; that he thereafter handed over copy of the FIR
to BBI staff for investigation and that on arrival of investigating
officer to the police station after completion of investigation, he
was handed over by the investigating officer parcels No.1 to 44
each containing 10 grams of Charas and parcel No.45
containing 55453 grams of charas alongwith application for
transmitting the parcels to Forensic Science Laboratory for
chemical analysis which he kept in safe custody of the
Malkhana; that he handed over the sample parcels, 44 in
number, alongwith application and route certificate No.21/21 to
constable Nabiullah No.27/LHC for. taking the same to the
laboratory which he did and on return, he was handed over by
him receipts / route certificate. Similarly, constable Nabiullah
No.27 was examined as PW-03, who stated that it was on

24.03.2020, when the Muharrir of the PS handed him over 44
sample parcels each containing 10 / 10 grams of Charas
alongwith route certificate; that he took the same to the forensic
science laboratory, where he handed it over to the office
concerned and brought the receipts back to the PS, which he
handed over to the Muharrir. Both these witnesses were
subjected to lengthy cross examination, but they remained in
harmony with each other as far as th: date, time and mode &
manner of transmission and handing over of the parcels are
concerned and nothing detrimental could be brought out from
their mouth. It is pertinent to mention that in the like cases, it is
for the prosecution to prove on record the safe custody of the
recovered substances, as right from it recovery till its sending
to the Police Station, is established on record and that both the
witnesses i.e. PW-01 and PW-03 were examined for this
particular purpose, but no inconsistency could be found within
their statements. Not only the prosecution succeeded in proving
the safe custody of the contraband in tlie Police Station, but also
PW-03, who took the test samples to the office of the Chemical
Examiner explained the minute details of his departure to the
office of the Chemical Examiner. It was contended with
vehemence that the sample parcels were dispatched to the
forensic science laboratory beyond 72. hours of its seizure and

as such, Rule-4 of the Control of Narcotic
Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001 has been
blatantly violated, which, in turn, not only overshadows its safe
custody, but also impairs and vitiates the conclusions and
reliability of the report of the Government Analyst, thus,
rendering it incapable of sustaining conviction. This limb of the
arguments of learned counsel for the appellant has no force, as
on one hand, the Muharrir (PW-01) while recording his
statement has plausibly explained the delay to the effect that he
received the sample parcels after ‘he investigating officer
arrived at the Police Station and that there were holidays on
21%, 22" and 23" of March, 2020, so he handed over the same
to PW-03, on 24.03.2020, whereas, on the other, the said Rules
are directory in nature and not mandatory and any lapse in
compliance thereof does not automatically discard the whole
prosecution case, particularly when safe custody is otherwise
proved as in the instant case. In this regard, reliance could be
placed on 2022 SCMR 1097 “Liaquat Ali and another Vs The
State” wherein the Apex Court has held that:

So far as the argument of the learned
counsel for the pettioner that the
contraband charas, its safe custody and
safe transmission is not established is
concerned, the learned High Court has
very ably dealt with this issue in

paragraphs 18 and 19 of the impugned
-~10-

judgment while. holding that the Control
of Narcotic Substanées (Government
Analysts) Rules, 2001 virtually place no
bar on the Investigating Officer to send
the samples beyond 72 hours of the
seizure. These Rules are stricto sensu
directory and not mandatory in any
manner. It does not spell out that if there
is any lapse and the time is consumed
beyond 72 hours, it would automatically
become instrumental to discard the
prosecution case in all manners. The
Control of Narcotic Substances
(Government Analysts) Rules, 2001,
cannot control the substantive provisions
of the Control of Na*cotic Substances
Act, 1997. These Rules cannot in any
manner frustrate the salient features of
the prosecution case which otherwise
hinges upon (i) receipt of information, (ii)
action by the concerned law enforcing
agency, (ii) recovery of contraband
narcotics, (iv) the report of chemical
examiner regarding analysis of the
recovered contraband, (v) the finding of
fact by the courts below after recording of
evidence i.e. (a) witnesses of the raiding
party, (b) the recovery witnesses, (c)
Investigating Officer and all other
attending circumstances. If the series of

acts which ultimately resulted into
-ll-

recovery of contraband narcotic are
juxtaposed with the violation of the Rules
due to one reason or the other as alleged,
it cannot by any stretch of imagination be
considered reasonable in law to smash the
prosecution case on its salient features.
The transportation of drugs either inside
the country or sending it abroad has
‘a become a menace against morality,
decency, public order, law and order
situation which indirectly intrudes upon
the sovereignty of the country. If this
practice is allowed to continue it will
squarely hamper the very purpose of the
law on the subject and would squarely
bring bad name for tke country in the

eyes of international community.”
9. All the witnesses have narrated the episode in a
straightforward manner and remained consistent as far as mode
& manner in which the vehicle was stopped, process of search
and seizure that was carried out, weighment of contraband and
separation of samples from each packet coupled with its
sealing, arrival of investigating officer to the spot and the
proceedings he conducted. Similarly, it has also been
established that the parcels on arrival of investigating officer to
the spot were handed over to the Muharrir of the police station,

who kept the same in safe custody of Malkhana and thereafter,
-12-

handed the same over to PW-03, who took the same to the
forensic science laboratory and on return, handed over receipts
and route certificate to the Muharrir (PW-01). In this view of
the matter, we lurk no doubt in mind that the prosecution has
fully succeeded in proving not only the recovery, but also the
safe custody of the recovered contraband and its transmission to
the Forensic Science Laboratory, where the report Ex.PK was
received in positive and as such, it has further strengthened the
case of the prosecution.

10. Learned counsel for the appellant referred to some minor
discrepancies in the statements of the witnesses, but they are
not of such a nature, which can be pressed into service, to
dislodge the trustworthy eye witness account of the witnesses
on one hand and the inherent worth of the collected material, on
the other. The defense could not bring on record that what mala
fide either the complainant or the investigating officer or even
any other police official had against the appellant to charge him
for commission of the offence and to plant such a huge quantity
of narcotics against him. We cannot ignore that the recovery
was effected way back in 2020, whereas, the witnesses faced
the test of cross examination after an extensive length of time,

in 2021, so the minor contradictions with regard to the timings

as to when the information was received, when the
SS

-13-

investigating officer reached to the spot and when they left the
same were bound to occur, as the police officials were and are
conducting the like proceedings on day to day basis and it
would be unnatural to expect them to answer with exactitude
the timings, without any difference as to minutes. Even minor
contradictions with regard to timings suggest that the police
officials were having no animosity with the accused charged or
interest in his prosecution with mala fide, as had it been so, the
minor contradictions of timings would not have happened,
rather the witnesses would have enabled themselves to reply
with exactitude as we experience in some other criminal cases.
The Apex Court in the case of “Shamsher Ahmad and another
Vs The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1931) has held that:
“While appreciating the evidence, the
court must not attach undue importance
to minor discrepancies,and such minor
discrepancies which do not shake the
salient features of the prosecution case
should be ignored. The accused cannot
claim | premium of such — minor
discrepancies. If importance be given to
such insignificant inconsistencies then

there would hardly be any conviction.”
-14-
11. As at the time of arrest, it was the appellant who was
driving the vehicle and that no other person was present therein,
so no ambiguity is left to hold that the appellant was in full
control of the vehicle and that he had the conscious knowledge
and possession of the recovered substance, more particularly,
when the same was recovered from its secret cavities. It is also
evident from the record that right from the day first till
conclusion of the trial, none could appear to claim ownership of
the vehicle, which aspect farther confirms our belief that the
vehicle was possessed at the crucial time by no other person,
but the appellant and it was he who was attempting to transport

the contraband after concealing the same in its secret cavities.
The Apex Court in case titled “Kashif Amir Vs_the State”
(PLD 2010 Supreme Court 1052) was pleased to hold that:

“Further, when a person is driving the
vehicle, he is Incharge of the same and it
would be under his control and
possession, hence, whatever articles lying
in it would be under his control and
possession. Reference in this behalf may
be made to the case of Muhammad Noor
v. The State (2010 SCMR 927). Similarly,

in the case of Nadir Khan v. State (1988
-15-

SCMR 1899) this court has observed that
knowledge and awareness would be
attributed to the Incharge of the vehicle.”

12. In another case, reported as “Syed Karam Hussain Shah

and others Vs The State and others” (2019 MLD 1445), it was
held that:

“...in this case the contraband was
CO concealed in front doors of the vehicle,
therefore, onus is upon the appellants to
prove in terms of Article 122 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as to how
the contraband was concealed in the car
and as such, the appellants have not
explained the circumstances. At last, the
Apex Court has also laid down heavy
burden of proof upon the driver of
vehicle, against whom the prosecution has
discharged its onus and the driver of the
vehicle is to be declared responsible
person for transportation of narcotics as
no condition or qualifications are made in

Section 9(c) of CNSA, 1997.”
-16-

13. We may observe that the menace of narcotics is
increasing day by day and more and more young people are
becoming addicted to narcotics these days. It is more alarming
that even children are known addicts and the prevalence of this
harmful addiction knows no boundaries and ultimately, the
youngsters are bound to lose their health and will suffer from
chronic diseases in the years to come, if they are not salvaged.
Keeping in mind the consequences of the increasing tendency
of the menace of narcotics, the legislative strictness in the form
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances Act,
2019 was brought about in the province, so the offenders must
be combated strictly in accordance with the intent and purpose
of the Legislature.
14. Turning to the quantum of sentence being awarded to the
appellant, it has been established on the record that he was
arrested red handed while trafficking. huge quantity of Charas
weighing 55893 grams, which has crossed the threshold
provided in proviso to section 9(d) CNSA. Clause (d) of
section 9 CNSA and the proviso thereto are reproduced
hereunder for ready reference:

“(d) death, imprisonment for life or

imprisonment for a term which may

extend to fourteen years and with fine

which may extend be up to rupees one

million and not less than five lacs, if
the quantity of narcotic substance
-17-

exceeds the limits of one kilogram:
Provided that if the quantity

exceeds ten kilograms, the

punishment shall not be less than

imprisonment for life in any case.”
15. As the prosecution has successfully proved the charges
against appellant, so keeping in view the mandate of section
9(d) CNSA, the learned trial court has rightly awarded him
life imprisonment.
16. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above
leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution has
fully succeeded in bringing home the guilt against the appellant
and that the impugned judgment suffers from no illegality or
irregularity which calls for no interference. The instant criminal

appeal being bereft of merit is hereby dismissed.
