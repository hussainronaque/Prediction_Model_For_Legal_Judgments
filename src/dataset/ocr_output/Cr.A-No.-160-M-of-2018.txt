WIQAR AHMAD, J.- This order is directed to

faced trial before the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge Behrain in a case registered
against them vide FIR No. 34 dated 06.06.2016
under sections 324,34 PPC at Police Station
Kalam District Swat.

2. FIR was lodged on the basis of

‘Murasila’ sent by Salim Yousaf SHO, Police

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Station Kalam from Civil Hospital Kalam on
06.06.2016. It is incorporated in the ‘Murasila’
that the SHO proceeded to emergency ward of
civil hospital Kalam, pursuant to receiving
information of bringing of. the injured, where he
found one Rehmat Ali son of Mubarak Shah, who
was injured and in unconscious condition. The
complainant namely Rozi Khan, who was present
with the injured reported to the SHO that the
injured was his relative. He along with the injured
and other persons had gone to village Banda from
Kandail, a day before the occurrence i.e. on
05.06.2016. They spent a night there. Then they
found livestock of one Sher Gul in village Banda,
which were taken by them to an area known as
Shareek. On reaching the area of Shareek, it was
08:00 A.M when they found the accused Tawkal,
Peer Gul both sons of Sher Din and Behram son
of Gul Sher all residents of Matiltan. After a brief
verbal altercation, all the three accused were
alleged to have started firing upon the
complainant-party with their respective firearms,
-as a result of which Rehmat Ali received injuries
on his right arm and left foot, while the .
complainant and his other fellows escaped un-

hurt. It was also stated that some goats might have

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
got injured as a result of firing. Rehmat Ali
injured was taken to civil hospital Kalam for
treatment. Complainant charged the above named
three accused for making firing upon them with
the intention to commit their murder. Dispute
over grazing of livestock in village Banda was
stated to be a motive for the alleged occurrence.

3. Investigation in the case was kicked
off. Opinion of doctor regarding the nature of
injuries was received by the Investigating Officer,
statements of the PWs were recorded. Eleven
empties of 7.62 bore were also recovered from the
spot. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was put in Court. Charge was framed
against the accused on 08.05.2018, which was
denied by the accused facing trial, whereafer the
prosecution was invited to produce its evidence.
The prosecution produced eleven (11) witnesses
and closed its evidence. Statements of accused
were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. On
conclusion of trial, the two accused namely
Tawkal Jan and Peer Gul were acquitted of the
charges, while the accused/appellant namely
_ Behram was convicted and sentenced vide

impugned judgment 21.05.2018 as follows;

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
© USS 324 PPC to seven years imprisonment
along with fine of Rs. 50,000/-, or in
default thereof, the accused shall further
undergo four months simple imprisonment.
© USS 337 F (iv) PPC to three years simple
imprisonment as Ta’zir and to pay
Rs.20,000/- as Daman, or in default
thereof, the accused shall further undergo
three months simple imprisonment.
© US 337 F (i) PPC to five months
imprisonment and to pay Rs. 10,000/- as
Daman, or in default thereof, the accused
shall further suffer one month simple
imprisonment. .
e All the sentences shall run concurrently,
however the appellant was' extended
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.
4, Learned counsel for the
. accused/appellant submitted during the course of
his arguments that general role of firing had been
attributed to all the three accused, in the FIR,
while the prosecution subsequently improved
their version by ascribing a specific role of firing
at the injured to the appellant namely Behram —
Khan. It being a dishonest improvement,
according to the learned counsel, have shattered
the case of the prosecution and such evidence
cannot be made basis for conviction of the
appellant. The learned counsel also added that
weapon of offence had not been specified in the
FIR, while subsequently it was so described in the
evidence which was also a_ dishonest

improvement. He further stated that the

prosecution had failed to prove its case against the

NAWAB * SB: Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
accused beyond reasonable doubt. He placed
reliance upon the judgments reported as “2011
SCMR 323, 2015 SCMR 1142, 2017 SCMR 724,
2017 SCMR 344, 2010 P Cr.L J 1842 (Lahore),

(Peshawar), 2018 YLR 1850 (Peshawar (Bannu
Bench) and 2018 P Cr.LJ 922 (Peshawar).

5. The learned counsel! for complainant
submitted in rebuttal that minor discrepancies do
occur in description of the occurrence at trial by
the witnesses, which could not be made a
justification for acquittal of the accused. He
further added that motive had not only been
established but stood admitted on record. He
further argued that the defence had failed to cross-
examine witnesses of the prosecution on material
aspects of the case, which statements to the said
effect shall be deemed to have been admitted by
the accused. He placed reliance upon the
judgments reported as 2011 SCMR 323, 2015

SCMR_1142, 2017 SCMR 724, 2017 SCMR 344,

2010 P Cr. LJ 1842 (Lahore), 2013 YLR 982

6. The learned Astt: A.G appearing on
behalf of the State supported the learned counsel
for complainant and adopted his arguments.

7. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including learned Astt:

A.G for the State and perused the record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that the
version of the occurrence as narrated in the FIR,
and as described by the PWs in their statements
recorded in the Court was varying from each other
on material particulars. The complainant namely
Rozi Khan has stated in his initial report that he
along with the injured namely Rehmat Ali and
other persons had exchanged hot words with the
accused party at the spot, whereafter the accused
started firing upon them, as a result of which
Rehmat Ali got injured on right hand and left
foot, while rest of the complainant-party escaped
un-hurt. The complainant was examined as PW-6
during trial, where he had stated that he along

with Rehmat Ali injured, Nausherawan and

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Gulbar Khan were taking the herd (39) of lambs
and goats belonging to Sher Gul from the area of
their village namely Banda Kandleshy to the
houses of Sher Gul etc. When they reached to the
place of occurrence, the above named three
accused appeared duly armed with firearms, and
started verbal altercation with them. The injured
Rehmat Ali was stated to be ahead of them, who
was fired at by the accused/appellant namely
Behram, while the other two co-accused started
firing at rest of the members of the complainant-
party, who took refuge behind the stones and
escaped the firing. From firing of accused, goats
and lambs were also stated to have got injured.
The change of version is noticeable in initial
version of the complainant and the one narrated in
his examination-in-chief, while deposing in Court.
It had not been stated by the complainant in his
initial statement that the injured Rehmat Ali was
ahead of them, and that accused Behram had
made firing upon him and that he got injured with
the firing of accused Behram. Nor had the other
two accused been assigned the role of firing on ’
rest of the complainant-party in the FIR. In the
FIR the general role of firing had been attributed

to all three accused upon al! members of the

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
complainant-party, indiscriminately. Substantial
improvements have thus been made by the injured
complainant in his statement recorded in the case
rendering his testimony untrustworthy. In this
regard reliance is placed on the judgment of
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of

“Farman Ahmad ys. Muhammad Inayat” reported as
“2007 SCMR 1825”, wherein the Hon’ble Court has

held as follows;

“The rule for safe administration of justice is
that improvement made by eye-witness in order
to strengthen the prosecution case, lose their
credibility and evidentiary value and when a
witness made contradictory statement or
improvement changing his version to suit the
situation, if found to be deliberate and dishonest,
would cause serious doubt on his veracity.

In the case of “Muhammad Arif v/s
The State” reported as “2019 SCMR 636”, the

Hon’ble Apex Court had also held a similar view,
relevant part of which is reproduced hereunder for

ready reference;

“It is well established by now that when a witness
improves his statement and moment it is observed
that the said improvement was made dishonestly to
Strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his
statement is to be discarded out of consideration.
Having observed the improvements in the statements
of both the witnesses of ocular account, we hold that
it is not safe to rely on their testimony to maintain
conviction and sentence of Muhammad Arif
(appellant) on a capital charge.”

9. It has also been admitted correct by

PW-6 in his cross-examination that all the

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
witnesses belonged to: one family but living in
different villages. He had also stated in his cross-
examination that they had not called each other to
village Kandleshy one day before the occurrence
but had met by chance and spent a night there. It
could nowhere be mentioned that for which
purpose the complainant, injured Rehmat Ali and
other persons have gone to village Kandleshy.
This explanation was necessary for the purpose
that all the PWs have admittedly been belonging .
to different areas and their getting-together at
village Kandleshy a day before the occurrence,
appears to be a matter of mere chance, from the
evidence of the prosecution. This along with other
circumstances creates doubt regarding the
presence of the PWs at the spot. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Muhammad Rafique alias Feeqa v/s The State”
reported as 2019 SCMR_ 1068 has observed as

follows;

“The Achilles’ heel of the prosecution's case is the
very presence of the named eye-witnesses at the
time and place of occurrence. To start with, the
very reason for all the nine named persons to first
gather and then to be present at the time of the
occurrence at the haveli of the present appellant is
not appealable to a prudent mind, especially when
there is no evidence in support of the parties
having a joint khall (water course), and the cutting
of the same on the day of the occurrence was also
not produced in evidence. To add to this crucial

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

legal lapse, there is a marked delay in carrying out
the post mortem of the deceased Muhammad
Azam. According to the complainant's own
version, which has been toed by other prosecution
witnesses, the crime was committed at 05.30 p.m.
at the Dera of Ilam Din, a locality in District
Lahore, while the post mortem was carried out
after a delay of nearly 22 hours on the next day at
03.00 p.m. at a public hospital in Lahore.”

10. The other circumstances creating
doubt in the case of prosecution included the
following discrepancies occurring in the
statements of the prosecution witnesses. PW-6
while deposing in Court has stated that when they
were going towards village Kandleshy, they had
not taken any blankets with them, while the
injured Rahmat Ali deposing as PW-8 in Court
has stated in his cross-examination that the other
fellows were having blankets with them. This
injured PW has also stated that it was the accused ~
Behram, who had made firing at him, as a result
of which he got injured, fell down on the ground
and became unconscious. When he came into his
own senses, he found himself in Saidu Sharif
hospital where he was being treated. He has also
stated in his cross-examination that when they
were going to village Kandleshy, his other fellows
were having blankets with them. He has also
stated that he and the other PWs were residents of

different villages. He had further stated in his

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-ll-

cross-examination that when they were leaving
for the area of Banda Kandleshy a person told
them that the goats etc had been belonging to one
Sher Gul. The other PWs have not so stated that
anybody had informed them about the fact that
the herd of goats and lambs were belonging to
Sher Gul. He has further stated that since he
became unconscious, therefore he could not say as
to whether the other accused had made firing
upon the complainant-party or not. The other PW
namely Gulbar Khan was examined as PW-9,
who has also given a similar account of the
occurrence, however during cross-examination
he has stated that he had given statement to the
local police in respect of the occurrence on
07.06.2016 at police station Kalam. He had
further stated in his cross-examination that he
went to Banda Kandleshy alone. All these
circumstances make presence of the PWs at the
place of occurrence highly doubtful. Statements
of prosecution witnesses cannot be termed as
confidence inspiring. Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case of Haroon alias
Harooni v/s The State and another” reported

as “1995 SCMR 1627”, has held as follows;

NAWAB SB: Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
eo

-12-

“Statement of a witness must be in consonance
with the probabilities fitting in the circumstances
of the case and also inspire confidence in the
mind of a reasonable prudent man. If these
elements are present, then the statement of the
worst enemy of an accused may be accepted and
relied upon without corroboration, but if these
elements are missing, then statement of a pious
man may be rejected without second thought."

In support of the said ratio, further

reliance is also placed on the judgments

reported as 1997 P Cr, LJ 2075 and

2017 YLR 436.

11. The occurrence had taken place at
08:00 A.M on 06.06.2016 while report was
made to police on 10:00 A.M. Though the
reason for delay has been explained in statement
of the SHO namely Salim Yousaf (PW-5) where
he has stated that there is no carpeted road
between the place of occurrence and civil
hospital Kalam. The area is hilly and the terrain
was very difficult which normally consume one
and half to two hours in reaching Kalam. Report
of the occurrence cannot be termed as a delayed
one, but those two hours may have been equally
utilized for managing the presence of the

complainant and other PWs at the time of

NAWAB ‘SB: Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Oe

IT K

-13-

lodging of the report, as well as for

deliberations and consultations.

12. The evidence of prosecution in the
case in hand not reliable at all. Benefit of doubt
has to go to the appellant/convict as he cannot
be handed down a sentence on the basis of such
weaker type of evidences.

13. For what has been discussed
above, the appeal in hand is allowed by
extending the benefit of doubt to the

accused/appellant. He is resultantly acquitted of

‘the charge. The appellant has already been

released on bail by this Court under section 426
Cr.P.C on 03.06.2019, therefore his sureties are
discharged from liability of bail bonds.

14. The connected appeal against
acquittal filed by the complainant is
dismissed, accordingly.
