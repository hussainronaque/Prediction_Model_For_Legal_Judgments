Masood Akbar, complainant has'also filed.
Criminal Revision No.181-P/2016 ws 435. read with _
section 439 Cr.P.C. for the enhancement of the
sentenced. As both the appeal and instant Criminal.
Revision are the outcome of the same judgment
dated 30.6.2016, therefore, this single judgment shall
govern the same.
2. Brief facts of the prosecution case are
that on 21.4.2014 at 1140 hours, Masood Akbar
(Complainant) reported the matter to the local police

on duty at RHC, Lachi to the effect that on the -

eventful day and time he alongwith Ali Akbar

deceased Wahab Gul injured and Hamid Akbar were

on the way to their village from Lachi Bazar and ©

vehicle bearing registration No.C-1677-Bannu being
driven by one Abdul Ghafoor, when reached the
place of occurrence, meantime appellant alongwith
absconding co-accused Liaqat Ali, Shahzad Khan
and Hamazullah alias Ghungattu duly armed

happened to be their co-villager emerged and started

indiscriminate firing at them, as a result of their

firing, Ali Akbar got hit and died on the spot, while :

Wahab Gul got injured, motive for the occurrence as
stated to be previous blood feud enmity.
3. On completion of _ investigation,

complete challan u/s 512 Cr.P.C. was submitted to

the learned trial court as the appellant alongwith’

absconding co-accused were absconding at that time.

During proceedings the appellant was arrested and
supplementary challan against him was submitted.
He was produced before the learned trial court where
he was charge sheeted to which he is not pleaded
guilty and claim trial, hence, the prosecution was

invited to lead it evidence.

4. In order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined 10 PWs in all. On close of the
prosecution evidence, statement of accused was
recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the

charges leveled against him. However, he did not

‘want to be examined on oath nor opted to produce

evidence in his defense. On conclusion of trial and
hearing the arguments of learned counsel for the
parties, the learned trial court vide impugned
Judgment dated 30.6.2016 convicted and sentenced
the appellant as mentioned above, hence this appeal.

5. learned counsel for the appellant in
support of this appeal contends that it is stated in FIR
that all the four accused have fired simultaneously
with Kalashnikov rifles at the deceased, who was
travelling and sitting at the rear seat of pickup along
with many passengers and some were travelling at
the rooftop of that vehicle, but no other passenger
received injury of that firing except injured PW
Wahab Gul who neither appeared in the witness box
nor charged the present convict/accused; that time of
occurrence given in murasila report does not tally

with the time of postmortem examination; that

injured eye witness namely Wahab Gul, driver of
pickup Abdul Ghafoor and Hamid Akbar (now dead)
and other passengers of vehicle have not been
produced in witness box to support prosecution

version; that no blood was recovered or taken to

. possession, for sending chemical examination to

determine the blood as noted in site plan was of

- deceased; that non recovery of blood from the vehicle

carrying the deceased create doubts about the place
of occurrence and presence of complainant (PWS)
and manner of incident; that in murasila report
complainant was stated to be injured, whereas
complainant (PW 5) in his cross examination has
categorically admitted and stated that he was not
injured, this also ereates serious doubts in the
prosecution version; that neither complainant (PW 5)
nor any other eyewitness have been named as
identifiers of the dead body of the deceased, PW-1 of
(absentia trial of appellant) has been named as
identifiers of the dead’ body of the deceased who in
his cross examination stated that he has received the
information about occurrence and the death of the

deceased Ali Akbar when he was in Lachi, this fac

G

exclude the presence of complainant (PW 5) at the
spot of occurrence; the solitarily eyewitness (PW 5)
has made material contradiction, improvement and
deviation from his first stance at the trial as indicated
in his cross examination, therefore he was not to be
believed by the trial court for recording the
convection of appellant, that the witness who was
entrusted with warrant under section 204 and 87
Cr.P.C. against ‘the appellant/accused was not
examined as prosecution witness to prove the charge
of abscondence, the mere abscondance is not
sufficient to prove the alleged guilt. of the appellant:
that motive setup in the FIR has not been proved; that ~
non appearance of injured eye witness Wahab Gul in
witness box has furnished no justification to the trial
court for recording convection under section 324 PPC
against the appellant, likewise the non-appearance of
driver of pickup in Witness box has provided no |
justification to the trial court for recording conviction
in term of awarding damages for the alleged damage
of the vehicle; that solitary, interested and partisan

witness (PW 5) on principle of safe administration of

Gh

justice is unbelievable; that seat of injury do not fit in
the prosecution story because:-
(a) Entry and exit wound are through and through

and per the prosecution story the firing was made

from right side with Kalashnikov rifle with exit

wound but no one sitting with the deceased was hit

nor any Bullet mark was found inside the vehicle.
(b) — injury No. 2: entry and exit wound have not

been identified.

{c) Injury No. 3 : fracture, no description of injury

has been recorded whether it was old fracture, fresh,

with fir-arm or due to fall etc.

(d) Injury No. 4: it was on right side of chest with

corresponding exit wound. If the deceased was seated |

at rear seat, facing South having his right side ~

towards accused then injury on right-side chest

without corresponding exit wound was not possible at -

all.

(e) Injury No. 5: same as above.

(f) Injury No. 6: It is on left side at left temporal

bone which is against the prosecution story, position

of the accused given in the evidence and site plan.

(g) Injury No. 7: Again it is on left side which is
against the prosecution story; that FIR was chalked
out on the basis of murasila of police official which

was recorded at the hospital is alien to the provision

of section 154 Cr.P.C., thus, the basis of very FIR

‘was not legal; that the prosecution has failed-to prove

his case against the appellant beyond any shadow of
doubt, thus, appellant is entitled to acquittal.

6. While opposing the appeal the jearned

AAG assisted by the learned counsel of appellant —

contends that sufficient incrementing evidence
available on the record in the form of statement of

complainant (PW5), who stated before the trial court

that he himself saw the appellant along with three |

other co-accused have fired simultaneously. with
Kalashnikov rifle at the deceased when he’ was

travelling by a pickup, which inspire confidence and

connect the appellant with the commission of the —

crime; that exhibit PM and exhibit Pw2 (FSL
Report) fully support the prosecution case; that the

prosecution has proved his case against the appellant

beyond any shadow of doubt, therefore, the appeal

filed by the appellant against his conviction and

eee ee
sentence be dismissed. Learned Counsel for the
complainant has placed reliance on Noor Mohammad

versus the State and another (2005 is SCMR 1958),

Saeed and 2 others versus the State (2003 SCMR
747), Babbar Sher vs the State (2006 P.Cr.L.J 174).

7. We have gone through the record

carefully and considered the submissions of the
’ learned counsel for the parties.
8. The whole case of the prosecution is
resting on the statement of PWS who is complainant .
and the eyewitness of the occurrence. He stated in
his statement before the trial court that deceased Ali
Akbar was his real uncle, and on the fateful day of
occurrence he in the company of deceased Ali Akbar
and Hamid Akbar (now dead) an eye witness of the .
occurrence had come to Lachi for purchase of
livelihood. At about 11 A.M. they moved from Lachi —
towards their village by Datsun pick up, the road:
leading towards their village was damaged due to-
which the vehicle became slow and stopped at the
point of occurrence. In: the meanwhile, accused

liagat Ali, Hamzullah Khan, .Afsar Khan and

Shahzad Khan appeared and started firing with
GE

10

klashinkove rifle. As a result of that firing Ali Akbar
his uncle got injured and died, whereas another
passenger Wahab Gul got injured. The vehicle was

also damaged due to firing of the accused. After the

firing the accused fled away from spot on

‘motorcycle. The deceased was shifted to hospital

where he lodged the report of occurrence in RHC,
Lachi. Motive for the occurrence was old enmity. He
charged the accused named above for the
commission of offence. The site plan was prepared ;
by the J.O. at his instance. Now this court will
analyze whether the PW5 withstood the test of cross
examination and his narration as eye witness despite
the above submissions of defense was of such worth
in which trial court was justified in recording
the conviction of appellant. It is very . surprising
PW5 in murasila has been shown as injured,
whereas in cross examination he did not accept
himself as injured of occurrence, this creates serious
doubts in prosecution story, in cross examination
PWS stated that he had informed the Bashir Khan SI
about the occurrence through call from the mobile

of his co-villager, neither he disclosed his name nor

11

he produced him as witness of the occurrence,
whereas PW6 Bashir Khan SI in his statement has
negated the same by saying that he was informed

about the occurrence by Moharrir of PS Lachi, this

- part of the statement of PW-6 has shattered the

veracity of the statement of PWS. He has also stated

‘

in his cross examination, that he took the body of
‘deceased to hospital, but post mortem report Exh PM
speaks otherwise, it clearly shows that body of
deceased was brought by police and relative of the
deceased namely Nasir Khan s/o Hassan Ali PWI to —
the Hospital and they identified the body. of
deceased, this is a big question mark on PW5 as eye

witness of the occurrence. PW-] Nasir Khan in his
statement has admitted that he has identified the |
body of the deceased and further stated he had -
received the information of occurrence at Lachi,. and

Police in his presence at Hospital has not recorded .
the statement of any body, likewise his statement

was not recorded by Police. PW-5 in his report

before police and examination in chief has stated 4
accused fled from the place of ‘occurrence on

motorbike, when realized that four persons cannot

Ww

ei

12

board on single bike then in cross examination stated
the accused ran away from the place of occurrence
on two bikes, all this speak very loudly that PW-5

has made an improvement which has rendered his

_Statement of no worth to be relied upon. The cross

examination of the statement of PW-5 clearly
demonstrate that he made material contradiction,
improvements and deviation from his first stance at
the trial, therefore he has become unbelievable and it
was not safe for trial court to record the conviction of
appellant on the basis of his statement. In similar
situation the apex court in the case of Gulistan and
others which is reported in (1995 SCMR-1789) has
held:-

The conviction of the appellant rested on the
solitary statement of Muzaffar Khan PW-4. No
doubt, in a criminal case the conviction of an
accused can be based on the statement of one
witness without corroboration but the condition
is that the witness should be absolutely
dependable. Applying this principle of
appreciation of evidence in the instant case, we

find that the evidence of Muzaffar Khan cannot

attain and has not attained that_high standard

and he cannot, therefore, be _accepted_as_an

absolutely truthful witness or at least it is not of

that standard on which conviction can safely be

&

13

based _on his solitary testimony. Muzaffar Khan

PW-4 is a related and partisan witness.
(Emphasis is of this court)

9. Dr, Fahad Ajmal PW7 who conducted

the post mortem, in his cross examination admitted

that it is correct the size of entry wound of the

deceased person is different from each other and

. similarly is the case with the exit wound. He also

admitted in his cross examination that it is correct

that the difference of the size of the entry wounds |

indicates that all injuries were caused frony different
weapons. This clearly indicates that: medical

evidence does not support to prosecution version.

10. As far as the statement of PW-8 -is

concerned , the same in view of the non appearance

of PW Whab Gul injured , driver of pick up and
alleged eye witness Hamid Akhtar (now dead) in the
witness box is having no worth for the conviction of
appellant and the PW5 only eye witness in view of
his cross examination and Exh PM and statement of
PWI cannot be believed as true witness. |
11. It is admitted fact that PW Wahab Gul

injured eye witness, Driver of pick-up and

passengers of the vehicle i.e. the best evidence have
not come to the witness box in support of
prosecution case, which have adverse effect on the
prosecution story. In this situation, Article 129 of

Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 says that

, withholding of the best evidence leads to conclusion
“that if that evidence is produced would not favour to

. prosecution case. In this regard, Peshawar High

Court in the case of Jehad Ali reported in (2014
P.Cr.L.J. 1559) has held:-

Another damaging aspect of the case is that the
alleged eyewitnesses stated in their statements °
that, after the occurrence, people of the locality
gathered and with their help they shifted the
dead body of deceased to the police station but.
prosecution failed to produce any one from
those persons to lend corroboration to the
prosecution story. It is a case of murder in
which death or life imprisonment ‘can be
awarded. In such like cases, the prosecution is
always bound to corroborate through some
independent sources-which is totally lacking in
the instant case except the statements of two
alleged eye-witnesses who are admittedly
closely related to the deceased and having
strained relations with the appellant family. It is
settled principle of law that if a best piece of
evidence available with a party is with-held,
then it is presumed that the said party has some

G

15

sinister motive behind, for withholding the same
piece of evidence. (Emphasis is of this court).

12. It is also in evidence that no blood was

recovered taken into possession from the place of

oceurrence i.e. pick-up and sent to FSL for

determination that it was of the deceased blood, none
recovery of blood from the place of occurrence
creates doubts about the place of occurrence,
presence of complainant PW-5 and manner of

incident. The Apex Court of Azad Jammu and

Kashmir in the case of Muhammad Yousaf and

another reported in (PLD 2008 SC-(AJK) page-6)
while dealing with such situation has held:- .

Now the question emerges that when the
blood or blood-stained, clay was not recovered
from the place of occurrence or if at all it was
recovered, they why it was suppressed? It also
could not be ignored at the same time that in
the instant case no inquest report or injury
sheet was placed before the Court alongwith |
“the challan. The learned counsel for the
complainant was also confronted that why the
inquest report and injury sheet of the deceased
prepared by the police were not placed on
record. He simply stated that it shall not make
any difference, but the question which

perturbs our mind is that according to eye-

16

witnesses the deccased sustained only one
bullet injury, while according to medical
Teport, he sustained two fire-arm injuries.

According to the report of doctor, the death

occurred due to a lot of bleeding but no blood

or blood-stained clay was recovered from the

place_of occurrence. These factors create

doubt regarding place of occurrence and the

manner of occurrence,

(Emphasis is of this court).

13. It is an admitted fact PW Wahab Gul
injured witness has not appeared in witness box to
support the case of prosecution regarding his injury
then conviction of appellant for his injury cannot be
recorded, it is also on the record that driver of
vehicle has not examined himself to support the story
of prosecution regarding the damage of his vehicle _
then it was not safe for the trial court to convict the
appellant for causing damage to vehicle. The Apex
Court regarding this situation in the cases of Sher
Khan and others and Asghar Ali alias Sabah and
others which are reported in (1991 SCMR 241 and
1992 SCMR 2088), has held:-

1991 SCMR-24]

Sher Khan was charged of causing an injury

with spear on the neck of Bahadur (not

17

produced)which proved simple. In spite of the
non-appearance of Bahadur Khan and of his
having been won over, the conviction of Sher
Khan was recorded only for the reason that in
view of the close relationship that he had with
the appellants, it was unlikely that he would
appear as a witness. The relationship with the
other witnesses who appeared was equally
close. Therefore, such a relationship was not
sufficient for justifying the non-appearance or
non-production of Bahadur. The fact that he
was not produced would lead us to draw an
adverse conclusion. Ifa person does not make
the statement in respect of his own injury then

it_is difficult to sustain the conviction with

regard to that injury on the statement_of

others. In the circumstances, in view of this

conduct of Bahadur it is not possible to record
the conviction of Sher Khan. (Emphasis is of

this court).

1992 SCMR 2088

22. Under the injunction of Islam, if an
injured witness himself does not appear to
charge an accused for his injury and the Court is
not satisfied with his disability or incompetence
or reason for not appearing then the conviction
for his injury cannot be recorded on the basis of
other evidence under Qisas provision, Qisas is a

personal right and as it now stands, if the person

aggrieved therefroni forgives it, and one way of.

forgiving the wrong doer:is not appearing in
support of the case against the wrong doer, there

will be no Qisas.

18

24. The upshot of the above discussion is
that the reluctance of Arshad Ali to make a
statement on oath about his own injuries and
that of his father have all pervasive effect on the
whole prosecution case which considered with
the other defects already pointed out, cannot be
taken to be sufficient to make out a case of the
prosecution reasonably beyond doubt so as to
ensure the safe administration of criminal

justice. The recoveries effected allegedly

cannot, in the case in hand, play any decisive
role where the ocular evidence is disbelieved

and the investigation is suspect.

14. Admittedly, the motive set up in the FIR
has not been proved, even the learned trial court, in
GH its judgment has disbelieved the same. .
15. As observed hereinabove the PW-5 was
interested and partisan witness, he on the principle of
administration of justice was not true witness and
trial court has wrongly placed reliance on his
statement for recording conviction -of appellant. Even
otherwise, the statement of PW-5 which was
contradicted by PW-1 and PW-8 has made the
prosecution case highly doubtful. In this regard the
case of Mahmood Khan reported in (1972 SCMR

620, and case of Ayub Mashi reported in PLD 2002

19

SC-108) are relied upon, wherein it was held by the
Apex Court:-
1972 SCMR-620

After hearing the learned counsel for the
petitioner and examining the reasons advanced
by the High Court for acquitting “the
respondents, we are of the view that it is not a
case where it can be said that the view taken

by the High Court was either perverse or not -

: sustainable on the record. Once the evidence

, of Mst. Pari is ruled out, only the ocular
account furnished by Fazle Mahmood remains
in the field. It is unfortunate that he did not
give any details whatsoever in the F.].R. made
by him and the medical evidence contradicts -
his story about two effective shots having’
been fired at the deceased. There is also doubt

@ as to whether he was in fact able to see the

assailants while sitting in his own Chappar at
a distance of 200 paces from the scene of
murder. In these circumstances, the High
Court appears to have acted rightly, in
accordance with correct principles governing
the safe dispensation of criminal justice, in
refusing to place reliance: on the solitary
testimony of Fazle Mahmood.
PLD 2002 SC-108
It is hardly necessary to reiterate that the
prosecution is obliged to prove its case against
the accused beyond any réasonable doubt and
if it fails to do so the accused is entitled to the

benefit of doubt as of right. It is also firmly

settled that if there is an element of doubt as to
20

the guilt of the accused the benefit of that
doubt must be extended to him. The doubt of
course must be reasonable and not imaginary
or artificial. The rule of benefit of doubt,
which is described as the golden rule, is
essentially a rule of prudence which cannot be
ignored while dispensing justice in accordance
with law. It is based on the maxim, “‘it is better
that tcn guilty persons be acquitted rather than
one innocent person be convicted”. In simple
words it means that utmost care should be
taken by the Court in convicting an accused. It
was held in The State V. Mushtaq Ahmad
(PLD 1973 SC 418) that this rule is antithesis
of haphazard approach or reaching a fitful
decision in a case. It will not be out of place to
mention here that this rule occupies a pivotal
place in the Islamic law and is enforced
rigorously in view of the saying of: the Holy
Prophet (p.b.u.h) that the “mistake of Qazi
(Judge) in releasing a criminal is better than
his mistake in punishing an innocent.”

16. The prosecution version that appellant
remained absconder for one year and this proves his
guilt cannot hold the ground. Mere abscondence in
absence of unimpeachable evidence is of no value, as
we have observed hereinabove that the prosecution

star witness PW-5 presence on the spot at the time of

occurrence is highly doubtful. In the case of Ahmad
21

Ali which is reported in (2004 P.Cr.L.J. 788) the

Hon’ble Peshawar High Court has held:-

Mere abscondence per se is not sufficient for
establishing the guilt of an accused person
unless the prosecution is able to establish its
case through unimpeachable nature of

evidence, which is lacking in this case.

17. The contention of learned counsel for
the appellant that FIR chalked out on the basis of
murasila of police official which was recorded at the
hospital is alien to the provision of section 154
Cr.P.C. and FIR cannot be chalked out on the basis of
murasila is not valid. Even the minority view, which
is cited in support of that contention from the
judgment reported as 2015 SCMR 423, says that an
FIR prepared at the crime spot without plausible
reason was considered to be suspicious, so it does not
support to the contention of learned counsel for
appellant that FIR cannot be chalked out on the basis
of murasila of police.

18. In the light of above discussions, this

appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment of learned
22

Additional Sessions Judge-II, Kohat dated 30.6.2016

is set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the

charges levelled against him in case FIR referred to

hereinabove. He be released forthwith if not required

in any other case.

| - 19. As we have accepted the appeal of the
appellant against his conviction, therefore, Criminal
- Revision No. 181-P/2016 for enhancement of
sentence has become  infructuous, which is
accordingly dismissed.

Above are the detailed reasons of our ie
