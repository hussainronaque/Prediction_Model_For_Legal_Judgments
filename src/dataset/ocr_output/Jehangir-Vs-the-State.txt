JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Jehangir, seeks bail in case FIR No.469 dated 16.04.2015
registered under section 17 (4) Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, in Police
Station Agha Mir Jani Shah, Peshawar.

2. According to report of complainant Zar
Muhammad Khan on 16.04.2015, he on receipt of
information qua murder of his nephew Rahim near “Masjid
Quba” situated in Hamid Abad No.1, rushed there and
found him in a pool of blood, murdered with firearm by
unknown culprit/culprits and taking away his motorcycle.
He was shifted to LRH, Peshawar from the spot by the
complainant. Later on, during investigation, besides other
co-accused, the petitioner was nominated as accused.

3. Complainant is not the eyewitness of the

incident. Similarly, none has come forward to furnish the

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

ocular account of the occurrence. Petitioner has not
confessed his guilt before the competent court of law. The
only circumstance at the moment against the petitioner is
the positive FSL report qua crime empties from the spot
and 30 bore pistol, allegedly recovered on his pointation,
but this being only a corroborative piece of evidence, it
evidentiary value will be determined and adjudged during
trial alongwith other strong circumstances of the incident
to make a chain touching it one end the dead body of the
deceased and the other the neck of the accused. At the
moment, in absence of direct evidence or confessional
statement of the petitioner, it is yet to be determined during
trial as to how far this corroborative piece of evidence
would be sufficient to connect the petitioner with the
commission of offence. It is settled law that bail may not
be withheld on mere ground that the offence is heinous in
nature, when otherwise, the accused has made out a case of
bail, because a mistaken relief of bail can be repaired by
convicting the accused when proved guilty during trial but
no proper reparation can be offered to an accused for
his/her unjustified incarceration albeit his/her acquittal in
the long run.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he

furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the

record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
