Rehman Khan Advocate for complainant

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.- Through this single
judgment, we propose to dispose of instant Criminal
Appeal No.28-D/2015 filed by appellant Nazir Ahmad
against his conviction and sentence and Criminal
Revision No.4-D/2015_ filed by Allah  Ditta
complainant for enhancement of sentence awarded to
appellant as both the matters are the outcome of one
and the same judgment dated 20.4.2015 rendered by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IH, D.I.Khan,
whereby the appellant was convicted under section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment and
pay compensation of Rs.100000/- under section 544-A
Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of deceased, or in default, to

2. The prosecution story as spelt out from the
FIR is that on 12.12.2011, complainant Allah Ditta, in
the company of dead body of his daughter namely Mst.
Fazilat Bibi lodged the report with Fazal Rahim Khan,
SHO in the fields of Fazal Hussain to the effect that her
daughter was married to one Nazir Ahmad and out of
the wedlock, she had two daughters Mst. Shakeela Bib
and Mst. Aneela Bibi. On the day of occurrence, when
the complainant returned at about ‘digar-vela’ after
cutting gross, his minor grand-daughters came to his
house weeping and told that her parents left the house
early in the morning for cutting woods but did not
return. The complainant searched for his daughter and
also asked from parents of his son in law about missing
persons. He was informed by the family members of
his son in law that Mst. Fazilat Bibi had been taken by
her husband for outing. On coming _ back,
announcement was made through loudspeaker of the
mosque. Thereafter, he alongwith co-villagers started
for fields. They reached near sugarcane crop of one
Fazal Hussain and saw the dead body of his daughter
who had been killed with sharp edged weapon. The
complainant charged the appellant, his son in law for

the murder of his daughter. Motive for the occurrence
-3-

was stated to be strained relations between husband

and wife.

3. After completion of usual investigation,
complete challan against the appellant was submitted
before the learned trial Court. The appellant was
formally charged. He pleaded guilty. However, the
prosecution was directed to produce evidence. In
support of its case, the prosecution examined nine
witnesses. Thereafter, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he
professed innocence and false implication. After
hearing arguments, the learned trial Court convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above vide
judgment dated 20.4.2015, hence the instant criminal

appeal and criminal revision.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant argued
that the appellant was suffering from psychiatric illness
and for medical treatment, he was referred to Sarhad
Hospital, Peshawar but without any report in this
behalf, the learned trial Court proceeded with the trial
and thus violated the procedure provided in section 465
Cr.P.C, therefore, the impugned judgment is not

sustainable.
-4-

5. The learned Assistant Advocate General
appearing for the State assisted by learned counsel for
the complainant did not seriously oppose the
contention raised by learned counsel for the appellant.
However, they contended that the appellant was
capable of understanding the proceedings, therefore,
there was no need for the trial Court to wait for report
in this respect, because the appellant though remained
at Peshawar for sufficient time but was re-shifted to

Central Prison, D.I.Khan.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and have gone through the

record.

7. The order sheet dated 08.3.2012 of the learned
trial Court reveals that when charge was framed and
read over to the appellant, he wanted to record his plea
of guilt by making a confession. He was explained the
legal consequences of such statement but since he was
adamant to confess his guilt, therefore, he was given
opportunity to think over the legal repercussions of his
such statement. On 15.2.2012, when the case came up
for hearing before the learned trial Court, the appellant
declined to record his plea of guilt and claimed trial

and thus the prosecution was directed to produce its
-5-

evidence on 29.3.2012 but postscript dated 27.3.2012
reveals that the learned trial Court received a letter
from Superintendent Central Prison, D.I-Khan asking
for permission to shift the appellant to Peshawar for
medical treatment which was found supported by
medical advice chit and permission was granted to shift
the appellant to Peshawar for medical treatment as
advised by the Medical Officer/Psychiatrist. The order
sheet dated 05.7.2012 reveals that as per endorsement
No.4007 of Superintendent, Central Prison, Peshawar,
the appellant had properly been examined as advised,
therefore, Superintendent Central Prison, D.I.Khan was
directed to produce him and thereafter, the learned trial
Court proceeded with further trial. Section 465 Cr.P.C
being relevant is reproduced below for ready
reference:-
“Procedure in case of person sent for trial
before Court of Session or High Court
being lunatic. (1)If any person before a
Court of Session or a High Court appears
to the Court at his trial to be of unsound
mind and consequently incapable of
making his defence, the Court shall, in the
first instance, try the fact of such
unsoundness and incapacity, and if the
Court is satisfied of the fact, it shall record
a finding to that effect and shall postpone

further proceedings in the case.

(2) The trial of the fact of the
unsoundness of mind and incapacity of the
-6-

accused shall be deemed to be part of his
trial before the Court.”
From perusal of above referred order sheets, and
observations of Dr. Munir Ahmad dated 15.3.2012, it is
manifest that ailment of the appellant was in the notice
of learned trial Court. In such circumstances, the
learned trial Court was bound to have complied with
the provisions of section 465 Cr.P.C, referred to above,
but it failed to do so. Admittedly, the appellant was
referred to Sarhad Hospital, Peshawar for treatment
and remained there for sufficient time, but we were
unable to lay hand on any document which could
convince us that the appellant was capable of
understanding the proceedings of the Court. However,
a letter dated 07.9.2012 is available on record
addressed to Superintendent of Police, Peshawar which
is though for the purpose of providing police guard but
it is also mentioned therein that the appellant has been
treated accordingly and the doctor has advised his
shifting back to Central Prison, D.I.Khan where he can
keep continue his prescribed treatment. In such
circumstances, it was the duty of learned trial Court to
have adopted the procedure envisaged under section

465 Cr.P.C which has not been adopted. It was held in
-7-

the case of Sirajuddin. Vs. Afzal Khan and another

(PLD 1997 SC 847) that:-

“From perusal of the above it is clear that
whenever question of insanity is brought to
the notice of the Court the Court shall
satisfy itself in the manner provided under
the law; whether the person is capable of
understanding the trial and defending
himself For such satisfaction medical
evidence if of utmost importance.”

In the case of Dilawar Khan. Vs. The State and 2

others (PLD 1995 Peshawar 121), this Court held

that:-

“The Court never seemed to be fully alive
to the contents of Chapter XXXIV of
Cr.P.C. It did not examine the ingredients
of section 464 and more particularly
section 465 of Cr.P.C, that pertained to the
Court of Sessions. The Court also was not
alive to the subsequent provisions of law
that related to the resumption of trial of a
lunatic in case he is considered to be
capable of understanding the
proceedings.”

8. For the reasons mentioned above and the dicta
reproduced above, we allow the instant Criminal
Appeal No.28-D/2015, set aside the impugned
judgment of conviction and sentence dated 20.4.2015
and remand the case to learned Additional Sessions

Judge-III, D.I.Khan with the direction to hold a proper

and thorough inquiry within the contemplation of
-8-

Chapter XXXIV Cr.P.C by constitution of a Medical
Board and after examination of the appellant by the
said Board, to proceed with the case in accordance with
law. Till then, the appellant shall be treated as an

under-trial prisoner.

9. Since the conviction and sentence of the
appellant has been set aside and the case has been
remanded, therefore, the question of enhancement of
sentence becomes irrelevant at this stage and Criminal
Revision No.4-D/2015 stands dismissed accordingly.
Announced.
