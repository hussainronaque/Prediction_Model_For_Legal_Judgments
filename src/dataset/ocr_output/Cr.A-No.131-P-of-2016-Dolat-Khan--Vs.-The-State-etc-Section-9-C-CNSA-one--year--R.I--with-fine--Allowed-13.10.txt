QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Daulat Khan,

appellant, moved this appeal under Section
410 Cr.P.C read with Section 48 CNSA, 1997,
against the judgment/order dated 17.02.2016
of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Peshawar, whereby the appellant was
convicted under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and
sentenced to one year R.I with fine of
Rs.10000/- and in default of payment of fine to
further one month S.1; while extending him

the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.
2. The case under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA
was registered against the appellant/accused
vide FIR No.1001 dated 13.12.2011 in Police
Station, Khazana, Peshawar, on the report of
Nawaz Khan S.I (complainant), who _ had,
allegedly, received complaints about selling of
narcotics/chars by the accused/appellant; and
while acting on a spy information, he along
with police party comprising constables
Aurangzeb No.231 and Fazal Rehmanullah
No.784 proceeded to the thoroughfare leading
to Khurasan Camp and_ found the
appellant/accused there, who tried to flee, but
was overpowered, and a_ black colour
shopping bag containing 15 puri chars Garda
weighing 60 grams and two kilograms chars
pukhta was recovered from the appellant.
After separating 5/5 grams from both chars
pukhta and chars Garda, the samples and the
remaining chars were separately sealed on
the spot, and amount of Rs.3000/-, allegedly,
earned by the appellant/accused by selling

chars was also taken into possession, and the
appellant/accused was arrested for
commission of the offence. The murasila
drafted on the spot by the complainant/S!I was
dispatched to the P.S, where case was
registered, leading to investigation, and
submission of complete challan to the learned
trial Court after completion of investigation.

3. In the trial Court, the
appellant/accused was formally charged
under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case against the
appellant/accused, the prosecution produced
a total of five PWs, including, the seizing
officer and complainant in the case, Nawaz
Khan SI (PW.1); investigating officer in the
case, Nasir Khan Inspector (PW2); marginal
witness to the recovery memo EXPW1/1;
Aurangzeb Constable No.231 (PW3), Yaseen
Khan DSP (PW4) submitted complete challan
in the case; and Zarwali Knan DSP CTD (PW5)
registered FIR (EXPW5/1) on the receipt of

murasila (EXPA/1). The prosecution,
thereafter, closed its evident; where-after,
statement of the appellant/accused was
recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC, wherein,
he refuted allegation of the prosecution but
declined to be examined on oath or produce
defence evidence. Having heard arguments of
learned counsel for the State and learned
defence counsel, the learned trial Court/ASJ-
V/Judge, Special Court, Peshawar, convicted
the appellant/accused under Section 9 ( c )
CNSA and sentenced him to one year R.! and
fine of Rs.10000/-; hence the instant appeal.
4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG heard; and record
perused.

5. The prosecution case against the
appellant is that there were complaints
against him regarding his involvement in
selling of narcotics/chars and that the
complainant/SI acting on a spy information
found him in possession of a black colour
shopping bag containing chars pukhta

weighing two kilograms and 15 puri chars
garda weighing 60 grams, which were
recovered from him in the presence of the
marginal witnesses to the recovery memo
(EXPW1/1); and samples separated on the
spot by the complainant/SI were confirmed as
that of chars in’ the report of chemical
examiner to whom the samples were sent for
chemical analysis.

6. It is, however, noteworthy that despite
so-called complaints against the
appellant/accused of his involvement in selling
narcotics/chars, neither any such complaint
was brought on the record, nor statement of a
complainant or a witness from the general
public was recorded to that effect; and,
likewise, no test purchase was conducted in
order to lend credence to the aforesaid
version of the prosecution. Similarly, no
warrant under section 22 P.O was obtained by
the complainant/SI inspite of his receiving
prior information regarding involvement of
the appellant/accused in the unsavoury

business. At least, the complainant/S! could
have procured presence of witnesses from the
general public in view of the fact that the
reported place of recovery was situated in the
midst of populated area. No doubt, police
officials are as good witnesses as any other
witness may be; but when evidence of the
prosecution comprise only of police officials,
and both marginal witnesses to the recovery
memo were _ police constables and
subordinates to the complainant/Sl, then their
testimony was to be accepted with extreme
care and caution for making the same a basis
for conviction of the accused and awarding

him sentences of imprisonment and fine.

T. The PWs in the instant case, namely,
Nawaz Khan complainant/S| (PW1) and
Aurangzeb Constable No.231 (PW3), one of
the two constable and marginal witnesses to
the recovery memo, were not consistent in
their statements before the Court, as the
former stated that he recovered Rs.3000/-

from pocket of the accused/appellant, while
the latter stated that currency notes of
Rs.3000/- were lying in the shopping bag. It
may be added here that the parcel containing
Rs.3000/- was not produced in the Court.
Likewise, the complainant/SI stated that he
first prepared the recovery memo and then
drafted the murasila, while the marginal
witness (PW.3) stated that the complainant/S|
first drafted the murasila and then prepared
the recovery memo.

8. In such a situation, when
contradictions/discrepancies appeared in the
statement of the PWs with regard to material
aspect of the case, it was not safe to rely on
such evidence for conviction of the accused.
As such, there was no convincing and
confidence inspiring evidence before the
learned trial Court to warrant conviction of the
appellant/accused. Consequently, the appeal
is accepted and the impugned judgment of the
learned trial Court/ASJ-V, Peshawar, dated
17.02.2016, together with conviction of the

appellant and sentences awarded to him, are
set aside, . Resultantly, The
appellant/accused is acquitted of the charges
levelled against him by the prosecution. The
appellant is on bail vide order of this Court
dated 02.03.2016, therefore, his sureties shall

stand discharged of the liability of the bail

bond.
