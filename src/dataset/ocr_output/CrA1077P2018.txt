were placed on their trial in the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XI, Peshawar. During the proceedings, a
compromise was affected between the complainant party and

they were acquitted of the charges, whereas the appellant

5. Challan against all the four accused was
submitted before the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,
Peshawar and accordingly charge was framed against all of

them to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

6. During trial, through an FIR No. 221 dated
28.07.2015, Abid Khan the brother of acquitted accused
Saalim Khan had charged the complainant Sajawal Khan,
Arshad and others for the murder of his brother Abdul Khaliq.
Probably in this background, a compromise was effected
between the mother of the deceased Naik Akhtar and Saalim
Khan according to the said compromise 05 kanal land was
transferred in the name of three minor sons of the deceased.
The learned trial Court while accepting the compromise,
through order dated 28.05.2016 had acquitted accused Saalim
Khan from the charges. Similarly, the other two co-accused,
namely, Babar Ali (brother-in-law of the appellant) and
Inayatullah (brother of the appellant), were also acquitted
pursuant to the statement recorded by Hussan Zari (mother of
the deceased), Sajawal Khan & Arshad Khan (brothers of the
deceased) whereby they have given a concession in respect of
involvement of Babar Ali & Inayatullah and on the basis of
their statement, they were also acquitted from the charges by

the learned trial Court vide order dated 04.06.2016.

7. At the trial, the material witnesses were Shah Zab
(PW-07) the son of the appellant and an eye witness to the
occurrence. In his statement, he has narrated the story by
referring the fact that on the eventful day they were attending
the marriage ceremony of Jehangir, he along with his deceased
father and mother Mst Aisha and two brothers, when reached
the place of occurrence, two persons, while riding on
motorcycle, came to the spot and at the relevant time, his
mother had made the pretext of easing herself in the nearby
fields at the time of occurrence, the accused opened fire at his
father due to which his father sustained injuries and died on
the spot, however, he did not hold his mother responsible for

the murder of his father.

Dr. Obaidullah, who had examined the dead
body, appeared as PW-08. Arshad Khan the complainant
appeared before the trial Court as PW-09 whereas Jehangir,
whose marriage, the appellant and his family were attending,
had appeared as PW-10. He had confirmed the holding of
marriage ceremony on the eventful day and the death of the
deceased. Muhammad Irfan Civil Judge-cum-Judicial
Magistrate, who had recorded the confessional statement of
the appellant appeared as PW-11 whereas the Investigation
Officer has appeared as PW-13. The appellant in her statement
recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. does not dispute lodging
of F.I.R by herself, however, has refuted to have confessed her

guilt before the Judicial Magistrate.
6
8. The learned trial Court, while relying upon the

confessional statement of the appellant, has sentenced her for

abetting the offence.

9. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
appellant has argued that when the principal accused was
acquitted, though on the basis of compromise then under the
law; the alleged abettor cannot be convicted and secondly the
confessional statement of the accused is neither true nor

voluntary nor is supported by any circumstantial evidence.

10. Keeping in view the above, the essential
questions for adjudication before this Court in this appeal are

that:-

(i) when before the conclusion of the trial
establishing the guilt of the principal
accused, the principal accused was
acquitted of the charges on the basis of
compromise then in such circumstances
whether the present appellant, who is only
charged for  abetment can be
independently convicted;

(ii) whether the confession recorded by the
appellant is true and voluntary and thus is
sufficient to bring home charge against
the appellant for abetting the offence; if
the first question is in affirmative.

11. While embarking upon the first issue, we deem it
appropriate to reproduce the relevant provision of law dealing
with abetment. Chapter-V of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860

(“PPC”) deals with abetment. Relevant provisions are

reproduced as under:-
7

“107. Abetment of a thing.- A person abets the
doing of a thing, who

First: Instigates any person to do that thing;
or

Secondly. Engages with one or more other
person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of
that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in
pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the
doing of that thing; or

Thirdly. Intentionally aids, by any act or
illegal omission, the doing of that thing.

Explanation 1. A_ person who, by wilful
misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a
material fact which he is bound to disclose,
voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause
or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the
doing of that thing.

Explanation 2. Whoever, either prior to or at the
time of the commission of fan act, does anything in
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and
thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to
aid the doing of that act.

108. Abettor.- A person abets an offence, who abets
either the commission of an offence, or the
commission of an act which would be an offence, if
committed by a person capable by law of committing
an offence with the same intention or knowledge as
that of abettor.

Explanation 1. The abetment of the illegal omission
of an act may amount to an offence although the
abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.

Explanation 2. To constitute the offence of abetment
it is not necessary that the act abetted should be
committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute
the offence should be caused.

Explanation 3. It is necessary that the person
abetted should be capable by law of committing an
offence, or that he should have the same guilty
intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any
guilty intention or knowledge.

Explanation 4. The abetment of an offence being an
offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an

offence.

Explanation 5. It is not necessary to the commission
of the offences of abetment by conspiracy that the
abettor should concert the offence with the person
who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is
committed.

109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is
committed in consequence and where no express
provision is made for its punishment. — Whoever
8

abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is
committed in consequence of the abetment, and no
express provision is made by this Code, for the
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the
punishment provided for the offence.

Provided, that except in case of Ikrah-i-Tam,
the abettor of an offence referred to in Chapter XVI
shall be liable to punishment of ta’zir specified for
such offence including death.

Explanation. An act or offence is said to be
committed in consequence of abetment, when it is
committed in consequence of the instigation, or in
pursuance of the conspiracy, or with the aid which
constitutes the abetment.

114. Abettor present when offence is committed. —
Whenever any person, who if absent would be liable
to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act
or offence for which he would be punishable in
consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall
be deemed to have committed such act or offence.

115. Abetment of offence punishable with death or
imprisonment for life if offence not committed—
Whoever abets the commission of an_ offence
punishable with death or imprisonment for life,
shall, if that offence be not committed in
consequence of the abetment and no express
provision is made by this Code for the punishment of
such abetment be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend to
seven years and shall also be liable to fine.

if act causing harm be done _ in
consequence.- and if any act for which the abettor is
liable in consequence of the abetment, and which
causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall
be liable to imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall
also be liable to fine.

116. Abetment of offence punishable with
imprisonment-If offence be not committed.-
Whoever abets an offence punishable with
imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed
in consequence of the abetment, and no express
provisions is made by the Code for the punishment of
such abetment, be punished with imprisonment of
any description provided for that offence for a term
which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest
term provided for the offence; or with such fine as is
provided for that offence, or with both.

If abettor or person abetted be a public
servant whose duty it is to prevent offence. — and if
abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose
duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence,
the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of
any description provided for that offence, for a term
which may extend to one-half of the longest term
9

provided for that offence, or with such fine as is
provided for the offence, or with both”.
12. The close perusal of the scheme of law for
abetment would show that the offence of abetment; if
established through confidence inspiring evidence; becomes
an independent offence of the offence which is committed in
consequence of the abetment, however, the punishment for
abetment cannot be greater than the main offence which is
committed in consequence of such abetment. Section 114 PPC
further clarifies the case that when the abettor himself is
present at the time of commission of offence for which he
would be punishable in consequence of abetment is
committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or
offence. Even if the act/offence abetted is not committed and
only a harm is done in consequence of the abetment by the
principal accused, the said abetment is also punishable under
Section 115 of the PPC, thus, the scheme of law is very clear
that the offence of abetment is a distinct offence of the crime
abetted and where the principal offender is acquitted for any
reason; it will not lead to any inference that the abettor, if on
available evidence is found to be involved in the abetment of
the offence and the offence has been committed, the abettor
shall still be held liable for conviction under Section 109 PPC
irrespective of the acquittal of the principal accused. In this
regard, reliance is placed on the case of Fateh Muhammad

vs. The State. (PLD 1961 (W.P.) Lahore 212, Shama alias
10
Jinnat Ali vs. The State. (PLD 1966 Dacca 269) and Sohna

vs. The State (1968 PCr.LJ 50).

13. Moving on to the next question. Admittedly, the
occurrence has taken place on the spot and in the manner and
mode as narrated in the First Information Report (“FIR”). The
medical report and the site plan also support the manner and
mode of the offence. The present appellant in her statement
under Section 342 Cr.P.C. admits that it was her who had
lodged the report and thus admits her presence on the scene of
occurrence. However, the lynchpin of the prosecution case
against the present appellant is the prompt confessional
statement of the present appellant which was later retracted by
her. It is by now trite law that a confession recorded by an
accused can validly form the basis of his/her conviction; if the
Court is satisfied and believes that it was true, voluntary, was
not obtained by torture, coercion or inducement and coherent
with the facts and circumstances of the case. Even if such a
confession is, later, retracted, it will not loose its evidentiary
value; if the same qualify the aforesaid criteria. The Apex
Court in the case of Mst. Joygun Bibi vs. The State. (PLD
1960 SC (Pak) 313) has dealt the matter of retracted

confession in the following words:-

“We are unable to support the proposition of law
laid down by the learned Judges in this regard. The
retraction of a confession is a circumstance which
has no bearing whatsoever upon the question
whether in the first instance it was voluntarily made,
and on the further question whether it is true. The
fact that the maker of the confessional later does not
adhere to it cannot by itself have any effect upon the
11

findings reached as to whether the confession was
voluntary, and if so, whether it was true, for to
withdraw from a self-accusing statement in direct
face of the consequences of the accusation, is
explicable fully by the proximity of those
consequences and need have no connection
whatsoever with either its voluntary nature, or the
truth of the facts stated. The learned Judges were
perfectly right in first affirmative, in declaring that
the confession by itself was sufficient, taken with the
other facts and circumstances to support Abdul
Majid’s conviction. The retraction of the confession
was wholly immaterial once it was found that it was
voluntary as well as true”.

Similarly, in the case of The State vs. Minhun
alias Gul_Hassan_ (PLD 1964 SC 813), the Apex Court

dealing with the matter of retracted confession has observed:-

“As for the confessions the High Court, it appears,
was duly conscious of the fact that retracted
confession, whether judicial or extra judicial, could
legally be taken into consideration against the maker
of those confessions himself, and if the confessions
were found to be true and voluntary, then there was
no need at all to look for further corroboration. It is
well-settled that as against the maker himself his
confession, judicial or extra judicial, whether
retracted or not retracted, can in law validly form
the sole basis of his conviction, if the Court is
satisfied and believes that it was true and voluntary
and was not obtained by torture or coercion or
inducement”.

Similar view was also affirmed in the cases of
Muhammad Gul and others vs. The State (1991 SCMR 942),
Raza Mohsin Qazilbash_and others vs. Muhammad Usman
Malik_and another_ (1999 SCMR 1794), Muhammad Amin

vs. The State (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 219).

14. In the present case, it is abundantly clear from the
record that prior to her arrest on 11.12.2014, the appellant
never remained in police custody and her custody was handed

over to police by the Air Force official, namely, Farid as
12
evident from her card of arrest because at the relevant time

since her husband was ex-employee of Air Force and she was
residing at Risalpur Cantt. On the following day, the appellant
was produced before the Judicial Magistrate at 1100 am, she
was given three hours to ponder and thereafter at 02.00 p.m.
her confessional statement was recorded. Muhammad Irfan,
the Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate, in support of
recording the confessional statement of the appellant, has
appeared as PW-11. He was cross-examined at length,
however, the said cross-examination does not give any
impression that the confession recorded by the appellant was
involuntary or recorded in her absence she claimed in her
statement recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. Although it was
a Friday when the confessional statement of the appellant was
recorded at 02.00 p.m. after the close of working hours,
however, it is evident from the statement of the Judicial
Magistrate on the record that the appellant was produced
before him at 11.00 a.m. and since the Magistrate had to give
time to the appellant to ponder on recording her confessional
statement and thus, Judicila Magistrate could not adjourn the
case after the closing hours and he had to complete the
process of recording the confessional statement of the

appellant on the same day.

The tone and tenor of her confessional statement
find its support from the contents of the F.I.R. wherein the

manner and mode of offence was explained. To find further
13
coherence from the facts and circumstances of the case it is

evident that the principal accused Saalim Khan was arrested
on 10.12.2014 and on his pointation 30 bore pistol bearing No.
A6749 was recovered vide recovery memo Ex.PW.4/3 dated
12.12.2014. The said pistol was sent to the FSL along with
eight empties recovered from the spot, according to which, the
opinion of the FSL was already available to have been fired
from one pistol, the subsequent FSL report Ex.PZ shows that
the empties recovered from the spot were fired from the same
pistol, which was recovered on the pointation of principal

accused Saalim Khan.

15. The medical evidence in form of post-mortem
report Ex.PW.8/1 shows that there were five fire-arm entry
wounds on the body of deceased and four exit wounds along
with the recovery of one spent bullet from inside the deceased
body during the post mortem examination suggesting that the
deceased was fired from a close range through means of fire-
arm. The purpose of travelling which the appellant had
disclosed in her F.I.R. and the mode of occurrence which is in
line with her confessional statement has also been established
on record as evident from the statements of Shah Zeb (PW-07)
the son of the appellant/eye witness to the occurrence and
Jehangir (PW-10) the maternal cousin of the deceased, who
had confirmed that on the eventful day it was his wedding and
the deceased along with the appellant were invited for the

same. On hearing incident, he rushed at the place of
14
occurrence and also helped taking the dead body to the

hospital.

16. In view of the above, it is established on record
that the appellant had promptly confessed her guilt before the
Judicial Magistrate which wrings true besides being voluntary
and find coherence from the circumstantial evidence,
therefore, was rightly admitted by the trial Court in evidence
and based her conviction on the said retracted confessional
statement. Thus, we have reached at the conclusion that the
case against the present appellant for abetting the murder of
her husband was duly established by the prosecution and the

findings in this regard are not open to any exception.

17. Resultantly, this appeal fails, which is

accordingly dismissed.
