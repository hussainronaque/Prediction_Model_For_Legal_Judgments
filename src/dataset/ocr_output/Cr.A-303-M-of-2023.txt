the Court intends to decide the subject criminal appeal

\e No. 303-M of 2023 titled “ Sabir Shah v/s The State

& another” coupled with the connected Criminal

Appeal No. 302-M of 2023 titled “ Saeed-ul-Ibrar v/s

The State & another”, as the subject criminal appeals

are by-product of one & the same impugned
order/judgment, passed by the learned Additional

conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court
convicted & sentenced the appellant/accused VIS 9

Substances Act, 2019 and awarded him a sentence
for rigorous imprisonment of five years with fine
in the sum of Rs. 1000,000/- (one million), in
default whereof, to suffer further six months SI.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr. P.C has also been
extended to the accused/appellant. Whereas,
through connected criminal appeal, claimant/
appellant sought the permanent custody of the
motorcar in question which was confiscated in

favour of the State.

2. Reportedly, the complainant/ Post
Commander, Hassan Khan Shaheed, Levy Post
Alladhand received prior information in respect of
smuggling of huge quantity of narcotics through
Suzuki Pickup No. Ai-1770. Acting on such
information, he, with other levy officials named in
the FIR laid a picket (Nakabandi) and the stopped
the aforesaid vehicle for the purpose of checking.
Driver of the vehicle disclosed his name as Sabir
Shah (the accused/appellant herein). During search
of the vehicle, the levy officials recovered a blue
colour bag, lying beneath the legs of the driver.
Due search of the bag led to the recovery of

narcotic as Chars net weighing 3044 grams

(comprising of three packets). The event was
reduced into in writing in the shape of ‘Murasila’
(Ex. PW-PA/I1) followed by FIR No. 10 (Ex. PW-
PA) dated 01.02.2023 registered against the
accused/appellant, U/S 9 (d), K.P CNSA, Act,
2019 at P.S/Levy Post, Hassan Khan Shaheed,

Alladhand, District Malakand.

3. - Upon arrest of the accused/appellant
followed by preliminary investigation on the spot,
after drawl of sample from the relevant‘bag, sealed
the same in separate parcels as well as the
remaining stuff and the ‘Murasila’ was sent to the

P.S/Levy Post concerned.

4, On completion of the investigation,
challan was drawn and was sent-up for trial to the
learned trial Court. Accused was confronted with
the statement of allegations through a formal
charge-sheet to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

5. To substantiate the guilt of the
accused/appellant, the prosecution placed
reliance on the account five (05) PWs. The

accused was confronted with the evidence so

Nawab (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
4.

furnished through statement of accused within the

meaning of section 342 Cr.P.C.

6. On conclusion of proceedings in the
trial, in view of the evidence so recorded and the
assistance so rendered by the learned counsel for
the accused/appellant and the learned State
counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully
brought home charge against the appellant/
accused, Sabir Shah, through cogent & worth
reliable evidence, as such, the accused was
i convicted & sentenced (as highlighted in the

proceeding Para of this judgment).

7. It obliged the appellant/accused as
well as the claimant/appellant to approach this

Court through the subject criminal appeals.

8. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/appellants as well as the learned Astt: A.G for
the State have been heard at a substantial length and

the record gone through with their valuable assistance,

9. The record so furnished would divulge that
the local levy officials under the command &

supervision of the complainant/Post Commander, Noor

Nawab (.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN

-5-
Zada laid a picket (Nakabandi), pursuant to receipt of

prior information. During Nakabandi, they stopped the
Suzuki Pickup bearing No. Ai-1770 for the purpose of
checking. During search of the vehicle, the levy
officials recovered Chars net weighing 3044 grams
(comprising of three packets), allegedly lying in a
blue colour bag, beneath the legs of the
accused/appellant, Sabir Shah. Now the only question
before this Court for determination would be as to
whether the accused/appellant being a driver of the
vehicle was having conscious knowledge of the
contraband in question allegedly lying in a bag in his
legs or otherwise? Needless to highlight that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the conscious
knowledge of the appellant qua the contraband in
question. It is an admitted fact floating on the surface
of the record that in this case the alleged recovery has
been made from the blue colour bag allegedly lying in
the legs of the appellant, however, it is a matter of
record that the aforesaid bag has neither been
separately taken into possession through any recovery
memo nor the same has been exhibited in the trial,
therefore, the prosecution has not been able to prove

the foundation stone of their case. It is also part of the

Nawab (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-6-

record that during the course of investigation it
transpires that the vehicle from which the alleged
recovery of contraband has been made belongs to one
Saeed-ul-Ibrar. The record shows that subsequently the
said Saeed-ul-Ibrar appeared before the Court as OW-2
and he has also produced the relevant documents of the
ownership of the said vehicle and in this regard he also
produced Zahoor-ul-Haq as OW-1, however, the
prosecution has not arrayed him as an accused in the
subject case. The possibility that in-fact the contraband
was placed by the owner of the vehicle could not be
ruled out. Since the contraband was recovered from a
place which is visible to ordinary eyes, therefore, in the
given facts and circumstances, the prosecution has not
been able to prove the conscious knowledge on the part
of the appellant. It merits to mention here that it is not
mere the possession of the contraband which is
punishable but such possession must be on the basis of
conscious knowledge. In the subject case, the
prosecution has not been able to prove that in-fact the
contraband which was placed in the vehicle in invisible
place was in-fact with the conscious knowledge of the

appellant or otherwise. In case titled “Muhammad

Novwab (5.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-7-
Noor & others v/s The State” reported as 2010 SCMR

927, the Apex Court has held as under;-

It is permissible to look into the object of the legislature and
find out whether, as a matter of fact, the legislature intended
anything to be proved except possession of the article as
constituting the element of the offence. Even if it is assumed
that the offence is absolute, the word "Possess" appearing in
the section 6 connotes some sort of knowledge about the
things possessed. So we have to determine what is meant by
word "possess" in the section. It is necessary to show that the
accused had the article, which turned out to be narcotic
drugs. In other words the prosecution must prove that the
accused was knowingly in control of something in the
circumstances, which showed that he was assenting to being
in control of it. It is not necessary to show in fact that he had
actual knowledge of that which he had.

Similarly, in case titled “Shahzada v/s The
State” reported as 2010 SCMR 841 it was also held by

the Apex Court that;-

No such evidence has been led by the prosecution to prove
the above aspects of the case so as to make the appellants
responsible for the commission of the crime along with the
Driver. If the property would have been lying open within
the view of the appellants or they knew the placement of the
property then the situation would have been different. In
such a situation, the appellants were required to explain
their position, as required under Article 122 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 and without such explanation their
involvement in the case would have been proved. As the
property was not within their view and they had no
knowledge of the placement of the property, therefore, they
cannot be held responsible and in joint possession of the
property with the Driver.

In another case the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan reported as 1997 SCMR_ 345 in such like
situation, the other fellow of the truck driver sitting with
him (driver) has been absolved of the charge in view of
the possibility that he might had no, knowledge of the

presence of heroin in the truck.

Nawab (5.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHIO KHAN

10. Other than the above, it is part of the

record that after drafting of the ‘Murasila’ followed
FIR coupled with separation of samples on the spot, the
investigation of the subject case was handed over to
Muhammad Ilyas, IHC. As per contents of Mad Report
No. 20, the Investigation Officer, Muhammad Ilyas,
THC in the company of Madad Muharir, Hashim Khan
and Muhammad Ayaz proceeded to the spot of
occurrence on 02.01.2023 at 05.25 hours, however,
when the aforesaid three officials were returned to the
police station/Levy Post concerned on the same date
ie. 02.01.2023 at 06:30 hours, as reflect from Mad
Report No. 21, they were accompanied by the fourth

official by the name of Muhammad Shahid. Needless

to mention that Muhammad Shahid is the most relevant
witness of the prosecution in a sense that he is the
marginal witness to the recovery memo, Ex. PW-3/1
which is with respect to the recovery of the alleged
contraband. Here the question arises, that if he was not
a member of the initial police party headed by the
Investigation Officer, Muhammad Ilyas, IHC, then how
& for what reason his name was later on mentioned in
the returning party of the police, therefore, this element

also cast a serious doubt on the mode & manner of the

Nawab @.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHIO KHAN
nan

-9-

alleged recovery of the contraband from the vehicle in
question which was allegedly driven by the accused/

appellant, Sabir Shah.

11. Muharir of the levy post concerned, Sana
Ullah appeared in the witness-box as PW-1. In his
examination-in-cross he has come up with an
admission that it is correct that in column 3 of register
No. 19 the signature of the seizing officer has not been
obtained. He has also shown ignorance about the
number of monograms registered in register No. 19.
The seizing officer/complainant of the case in hand was
examined in Court as PW-4. In his cross-examination
he stated that the case property was in the form of each
slab and the case property was in solid condition,
however, during the Court proceedings when the parcel
was opened, the case property turned out to be in
another shape, whereby, one slab was in soft form,
whereas the remaining two slabs were in solid
condition. The complainant also affirmed the assertion
of the Muharir of the levy post in terms that he had not
put his signature in register No. 19. Likewise, the
testimony of the Investigation Officer, Muhammad
Ilyas, IHC, PW-5 is not above the board. In his cross-
examination he has admitted that in their Department

‘Nowab (6.6) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-10-

there is Post Commander by the name of Naik Rehman
and the monogram affixed on the representative
samples by the abbreviation of “N.R” might be of his
name, whereas, the Post Commander of the subject
case is Noor Zada Khan and the name of his
abbreviation would be “N.Z”. In view of the aforesaid
admissions on part of the material witnesses of the
prosecution the case of the accused/appeliant qua his
alleged offence of transportation of narcotics is prima
facie standing in vacuum, as such, he is entitled for its

benefit.

12. It is also relevant to mention here that
in this case the seizing officer and the person who
has separated the samples on the spot is Post
Commander, Noor Zada, however, the parcels
prepared by him on the spot do not reflect the
abbreviation of his name as the monogram of
SN.R” has been inscribed on the same. Needless to
highlight that under the Rules and as per the
Judgments of the Apex Court the seizing officer is
bound to inscribe the abbreviation of his own name
as the abbreviation of “N.R” does not reflect the

Nawab G.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-l1-

name of none of the persons present on the
spot including the seizing — officer-cum-
Investigating Officer, as such, the prosecution has
not been able to prove that as to who separated the
samples from the recovered stuff and that as to who
has dispatched or taken them to the police station,
which failure of the prosecution is fatal for their

case. Such flaw was found fatal by the Apex Court

in case titled “ Khtar Iqbal v/s The State” reported

as 2015 SCMR 291 by observing that;-

The most important factor in that connection, which
compounded all those doubts and raised a big question
mark upon the veracity of the prosecution's case against
the appellant, was that after allegedly recovering the
contraband substance from the boot of the motorcar
driven by the appellant the parcels of the recovered
substance were sealed with a monogram reading as SJ
and it had been disclosed by Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2)
before the learned trial Court that the said monogram
belonged to one Sameen Jan Inspector who was not even
posted at the relevant Police Station at the time of the
alleged recovery from the appellant and as a matter of
fact at the said time the said Inspector was serving at a
Police Station in Quetta. Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2) had
not been able to advance any explanation whatsoever as
to why the recovery officer namely Assistant Director
Rehmat had not put his own monogram on the seals of
the parcels prepared by him and as to why he had used
the monogram of some other officer who was not even
posted at the relevant Police Station at the relevant time.

Similarly, this Court in case titled

“Usman Shah v/s The State” reported as 2022

Nawab (1.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
H,

-12-

YER 821 has also reiterated the same rational by

holding that;-

The seizing officer while appearing before the Court as
PW-2, deposed in his Court's statement that after
recovery of contraband, he separated samples for FSL
purpose and sealed in parcels Nos.1 to 8 and remaining
stuff in parcel No.9 with a monogram of "MK" which,
he categorically admitted that same is not pertained to
his name and in-fact the same stands for Mukhtiar
Khan, S.L, who was stated to be present with the
complainant. The alleged recovery seems to be doubtful,
rather hints at something to be planted by complainant,
because said Mukhtiar Khan SI was never cited as a
witness during proceedings in the instant case. This
witness, after few moments, in his cross-examination
contradicted his own statement by deposing that
“Mukhtiar Khan S.I. was present in the P.S, at that very
time. The MK monogram was lying with me in the
official van". Be that as it may, the Seizing Officer,
pursuant to spy information, should have been required
to have his own monogram with the letters "RK" in his
possession to have strengthened and substantiated his
version, but he disrupted the episode in a casual
manner.

13. It is part of the record that in the
subject case the investigation has been carried-out
by Muhammad Ilyas, IHC (PW-5), who is below
the rank of Sub-Inspector. For ready reference
Section 2 (e) (ii), K.P, CNSA Act, 2019 is

reproduced below;-

(ii) a police officer/official not below the rank of Sub-
Inspector, authorized by the Regional Officer;

However, in the case in hand, the
aforesaid mandatory provision has not been
complied with, therefore, on this score too, the

conviction & sentence of the accused/appellant

Nawab (6.8) HON BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-13-
recorded by the trial Court is not sustainable in the

eyes of law.

14, It is also part of the record that though
it is the case of prosecution from very inception
that the appellant was transporting the contraband
in the Suzuki vehicle bearing No. Ai-1770 and it is
their case that on search of the said vehicle the
alleged contraband was recovered from the
adjacent place near the driver seat, allegedly lying
in a bag, as such, it was an important piece of
evidence with the prosecution to connect the
present appellant with the commission of offence,
however, it is surprising that the prosecution has
not been able to produce and exhibited the said
vehicle in the trial Court. Though the rival claimant
of the vehicle Saeed-ul-Ibrar recorded his statement
as OW-2 and he also relied upon the account of
Zahoor-ul-Haq recorded as OW-1. We have gone
through the whole case record but could not found
any exhibited documentary evidence in this regard

except the bargain receipt and undocumented

Nowe (8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-14-

vehicle record system/registration documents
brought on record by the claimant/appellant,
Saeed-ul-Ibrar. The prosecution was bound to
make some reasonable & visible efforts to make
sure the production of the said vehicle and
exhibited the same during the trial, therefore, non-
production of the vehicle and non-exhibition has
cut the very roots of the prosecution case and thus
on this score too, the benefit has to be extended to
the appellant. It is an established principle of law
that when the prosecution has not been able to
produce the case property before the Court for its
exhibition then no conviction could be recorded for
the alleged contraband recovered from an accused
person. In a somewhat similar situation, this Court
in its earlier judgment rendered in case titled

“Usman Shah v/s The State” reported 2022 YLR

821 has held that;-

The vehicle, from which the alleged recovery was
effected, was not produced before the Court and was not
exhibited during trial. The case property had not been
produced by the police before the trial court without
any justification, which shows that the police had malice
towards the accused regarding recovery of the

Nawab GB) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-15-

contraband. Production of the case property before the
court was the primary duty of the police in order to
bring home the guilt of the accused. Non-production of
the case property was fatal to the prosecution's case, and
the same had destroyed the very foundation of the case,
which created a dent in the prosecution case causing
serious doubt with regard to the occurrence.

Similarly, in case titled “Muhammad

Fayaz v/s The State” reported as PLD 2017 Peshawar

74, this Court has also observed that;-

It is very strange to observe that despite pendency of
trial for about one year followed by repeated directions
issued by learned trial Court, the prosecution kept mum
for such a long period regarding non-production of case
property and then after destruction of the case property
on 26.6.2012, they did not utter any word for further 10
months, concealing the actual facts from the trial Court,
which creates doubt in a prudent mind regarding
recovery of alleged contraband from the possession of
appellant. Had there been any recovery effected from
the appellant, then the prosecution could have produced
the same before the Court for exhibition or to bring the
actual fact regarding destruction of case property into
the notice of trial Court which they failed to do so.

Likewise, in case titled “Smtiaz Khan v/s

The State” reported as 2020 P Cr.LJ 202 in a similar

Situation akin to the present one, this Court has

concluded that;-

We find a peculiar situation, where instead of
confronting the accused-appellants with the relevant
incriminating evidence/ case property, they were
confronted with the procedure adopted on the spot,
while no case property was produced and exhibited
before the trial court during the course of examination
of accused/appellants, so therefore, the evidence used
against the accused/appellant on that account was
incomplete.

15. It is well settled, it is not essential at
all to place reliance on multiple doubts coupled

with multiple grounds to extend the benefit of

Mame (.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-16-

doubt to an accused, even a single worth reliable
doubt is sufficient enough to extend its benefit to
an accused person as it is the cardinal principle of
criminal administration of justice that let hundred
guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent
person should not be convicted. In case titled

“Tariq Pervaiz v/s The State” reported as 1995

SCMR 1345 , the Apex Court has held as under;-

That the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right.

Further reliance is placed on the case

law cited as “Daniel boyd (Muslim name
Saifullah) vs the State” reported as

1992 SCMR 196”, where the following

observations were recorded by the Apex Court;-

Nobody is to be punished unless proved guilty on the
basis of reliable or true evidence. Benefit of every
reasonable doubt is to go to the accused.

This view also reflects in the

Judgment of the apex Court titled as “Ghulam

Nawab (G.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-17-

Qadir and 2 others vs the State” reported as

2008 SCMR 1221, wherein it was observed that:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of applicability. For the
purpose of benefit of doubt to an accused, more than one
infirmity is not required. Single infirmity creates
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable and
prudent person regarding the truth of charge, makes the
whole case doubtful. “

In support of the same rational,
further reliance is placed on the judgment of the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

“Muhammad Zaman vs. the State” (2014

SCMR 749), wherein it was held that;-

Even a single doubt if found reasonable, was enough to
warrant acquittal of the accused.

16. For what has been discussed above,
this Court is of the firm view that the prosecution
has failed to prove its case against the accused/
appellant, Sabir Shah beyond reasonable doubt, as
such, his conviction cannot be maintained.
Resultantly, while extending him the benefit of the
doubt the subject criminal appeal is allowed and
the impugned order/judgment of conviction &
sentence dated 28.09.2023 recorded by the learned
trial Court is set aside and consequently the

accused/appellant named above is acquitted of the

Neevoad (.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-18-

charges leveled against him. He be released

forthwith from the Jail, if not otherwise required.

17. As far as the case of the
claimant/appellant of Criminal Appeal No. 302-M
of 2023, Saeed-ul-Ibrar with respect to the grant of
permanent custody of the Suzuki vehicle is
concemed, suffice it to state, that it has never been
the case of the prosecution that the contraband in
question has been recovered from the secret
cavities allegedly prepared in the subject vehicle
rather their stance was that the contraband was
recovered from a bag allegedly lying in the legs of
the accused/appellant, Sabir Shah, therefore, the
findings of the learned trial Court in the impugned
order/judgment dated 28.09.2023 in respect
confiscation of the vehicle in favour of the State
needs re-consideration. It is also part of the record
that during the course of trial, the
claimant/appellant, Saeed-ul-Ibrar also produced
evidence in respect of ownership of the vehicle in
question which comprises of his statement recorded
as OW-1 as well as that of one Zahoor-ul-Haq
recorded as OW-2. In _ this regard, the

claimant/appellant also brought on record the

Nawab (G.B) HON'‘BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAHID KI

s°

-19-
bargain receipt as Ex. OW-1/I, vide which, the

vehicle was purchased by him from one Umar
Mukhtiar in lieu of sale consideration in the sum of
Rs. 6,20,000/-. He also brought on file the

registration documents/ “undocumented vehicle

record system” of the vehicle as Ex. OW-2/1,
therefore, on the strength of this documentary
evidence, the claimant/appellant is prima facie

owner of the vehicle in question.

18. The record so furnished would further
indicate that when the aforesaid vehicle was taken
into possession by the local police from the custody
of the accused/appellant, Sabir Shah who has since
been acquitted, the present claimant/appellant soon
thereafter approached to the learned trial Court for
the interim custody of the vehicle, however, the
said application was later on withdrawn. The record
further shows that the claimant/ appellant is a sole
claimant as no rival claimant has come forward till
date to claim the subject vehicle. The record is also
silent with respect to tempering or welding of the
chassis number of the subject vehicle. The record
also shows that the subject vehicle is neither the
case property nor used in the commission of any

other offence except the one referred to above,

Nawab (.B) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE SHAHID KHAN
-20-

therefore, the claimant/appellant has made out a
case for the custody of the subject vehicle/
motorcar. In case titled “Javaid Arshad Abid v/s

Station House Officer & other” reported as 2005
SCMR 735, the Apex Court has held as under;-

The disputed car was neither used in commission of any
offence nor any F.LR. regarding its theft was registered.
Petitioner claiming to have purchased such car which
had remained in his possession till same was taken into
custody by Anti-Car Lifting Staff of Police. No other
claimant had come forward. Custody of car was ordered
to be handed over to petitioner.

Similarly, in case titled “Muhammad

Hanif v/s The State & others” reported as 2011

SCMR 1471, the Apex Court has also held that;-

No other person has so far come forward to claim
ownership or possession of that vehicle. The petitioner is
not an accused person in the above mentioned criminal
case and he undertakes to produce the relevant vehicle
before any court of law if and when required to do so.

19. Accordingly, the connected Criminal
Appeal No. 302-M of 2023 is allowed, the
impugned order/judgment of the learned trial Court
dated 28.09.2023 is also set-aside to the extent of
confiscation of vehicle in favour of the State and
consequently the SHO of Levy Post/Police Station,
Hassan Khan Shaheed, Alladhand, District
Malakand is directed to hand over the

Vehicle/Motorcar_Suzuki_(NCP) bearing chassis
