RFA No. 66-D of 2011

Date of hearing 03.06.2015

Appellant / petitioner Muhammad Jamil by

Mr. Saleem Ullah Khan Ranazai advocate

Respondent Irfan Ellahi by Haji Muhammad Shakeel

advocate

MUHAMMAD GHAZANFER KHAN J.-This appeal
is directed against the judgment and decree dated
11/7/2011 passed by the learned Civil Judge-VIII
D.I.Khan, whereby suit of the appellant Muhammad

Jamil Khan was dismissed.

2. Brief resume of the case leading to filing of
instant appeal is that the appellant Muhammad Jamil
Khan filed a suit against the defendants Amanullah and
Irfan Elahi for recovery of damages to the tune of Rs.
five million in equal shares for loss of reputation,
profession, mental torture, disturbance and involving him
in criminal proceedings. However, the name of
Amanullah defendant was deleted from the case on
request of the plaintiff and only respondent/defendant

Irfan Elahi contested the case who filed written
statement. From the divergent pleadings of the parties,
the learned trial Judge framed as many as eleven issues
including relief, whereafter pro and contra evidence of
the parties was recorded and after hearing arguments of
their learned counsels, the suit was dismissed vide

judgment and decree dated 11/7/2011.

3. Feeling aggrieved, the plaintiff has now
sought the indulgence of this Court through the appeal in
hand to set at naught the aforesaid judgment of the trial

Court and to decree his suit as prayed for in the plaint.

4. I have carefully gone through record of the
case and anxiously considered the valuable arguments of

learned counsel for the parties.

5. Perusal of record divulges that the plaintiff
had not been able to substantiate his cause through any
tangible evidence brought on file. In a suit for malicious
prosecution, the plaintiff has not only to prove that the
prosecution ended in his favour but also that was without
reasonable and probable cause. He has also to prove any
enmity, grudge, ill will, hatred or malice with the

defendant.
6. The claim of the plaintiff was that the
respondent/defendant has caused damage to his
reputation, profession and made him to suffer mental
torture and agony. Though the plaintiff has proved
himself to be an advocate by profession having been
enrolled with the District Bar Association D.I.Khanfor
the last 16/17 years, but he has miserably failed to prove
that he was engaged in numerous cases, because he could
not produce a single wakalatnama to show his
appearance before the competent court of law. The
plaintiff has further alleged to have suffered
professional loss in monetary terms, but still there is no
documentary proof of his professional income nor has
produced payment of any income tax in support of his

monthly income of Rs.40/50 thousands.

7. As is evident from contents of the plaint, the
appellant had neither been arrested nor even remained in
police custody or judicial lock up for a single movement.
Even otherwise, the proceedings under section 107 Cr.PC
are preventive in nature and not punitive. Furthermore
the order on the basis of which the appellant has brought
the suit is for discharge of the accused and not an order
for acquittal. A cursory glance on the contents of the

impugned order makes it explicitly clear that the trial
Court has exercised its jurisdiction and power under
Section 249-A Cr.PC for which no stage is fixed. The
trial of appellant in the case in hand was not completed
and certain proceedings were yet to be carried out. At this
juncture, another legal question crops up for
consideration is whether the termination of further
proceedings and its ultimate culmination into discharge
of the appellant is legally tantamount to his acquittal as
well and can be made a valid base for claiming damages,
or the same embody two different meanings. The definite
answer to the said question is that acquittal and discharge
are two different terminologies and are diametrically not
synonymous. “Acquittal means to declare a person
accused of a crime to be innocent, while on the
contrary, discharge means to release someone from
custody, or allow someone to leave, or to pay off.What
can irresistibly be derived from the aforesaid definition
is that the impugned order of the appellant was not that
of acquittal, rather it was tantamount to his discharge
under section 249-A Cr.PC, for which no special

damages can be claimed”.

8. For the reasons discussed above, the learned

trial Judge has properly appraised the evidence brought
on record while drawing the conclusion herein impugned

to which no exception can be taken by this Court.

9. Resultantly, the appeal being devoid of any

meritable consideration is hereby dismissed.

ANNOUNCED JUDGE
3/6/2015.
