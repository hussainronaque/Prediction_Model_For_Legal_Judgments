NAZAR AKBAR, J: - Through the instant application,

applicant Allah Bux seeks post-arrest bail in Crime No.96 of 2013,
registered with Police Station Tando Ghulam Hyder, under section
302, 458, 380 and 34 P.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 30.11.2013 at about 2200
hours, complainant Vishnu lodged F.I.R. at Police Station Tando
Ghulam Hyder, stating that on 26.11.2013, in the evening, after
taking meal, he tied the cattle in the cattle pond and went to sleep
with his father Sattro Kolhi and uncle Pancho Kolhi in the courtyard
of their house on separate cots. On 27.11.2013 at about 0130 hours,
on barking of dogs, he and other family members awakened and saw
on the light of bulb accused Khadim Lashari, Mustafa Chandio and
two unknown persons duly armed with deadly weapons were taking
away his buffalo. Complainant party raised cries, which attracted
Kirshan Kolhi, Talo Kolhi and others. Thereafter, they chased the
culprits and asked them to leave the cattle, but they extended threats
of murder and then accused Khadim Lashari made straight fire from
his pistol, which hit Sattro Kolhi who fell down on the ground.

Thereafter, accused left the buffalo ran way. Injured Sattro Kolhi was
taken to hospital, but in the way he succumbed to his injuries.
Thereafter, complainant lodged the F.IR.

3. Learned counsel for the applicant mainly contended that there
is a delay of about 02 days in lodging of the F.I.R, which has not been
explained plausibly; that the applicant has falsely been implicated in
this case due to enmity with malafide intention; that the applicant
has not been nominated in the F.I.R; that no specific role has been
attributed to the applicant for causing any gunshot injury to the
deceased; that the applicant is behind the bars since his arrest; that
nothing incriminating has been recovered from the possession of the
applicant; that no direct evidence is available on record to connect
the applicant with the commission of alleged offence; that all P.Ws.
are interested and no private and independent person has been cited
as P.W. or mashir; that mere absconsion does not come in the way of
the applicant; that co-accused, namely, Porho Chandio, whose case
is identical to that of the present applicant, was granted bail by this
Court vide order dated 26.09.2014 passed in Cr. B.A. No.S-
349/2014, therefore, the applicant is also entitled for the same
treatment on the basis of rule of consistency; that the case of the
applicant requires further inquiry as contemplated under section
497(2) Cr.P.C. In support of his contention, learned counsel
for â€œthe applicant relied upon the case of Mitho Pitafi v. State
(2009 S C MR 299).

4. Learned A.P.G. as well as learned counsel for the complainant
opposed this bail application, amongst others, on the grounds that
the applicant alongwith his companions has committed a heinous
offence and caused murder of one innocent person, therefore, he is
not entitled for grant of bail.

5. I have given anxious consideration to the arguments advanced

by the parties and perused the material available on record.
6. Despite the fact that in the incident father of the complainant
had lost his life the complainant party did not bother to lodge a
prompt F.I.R. in order to rope the culprits; that also there is a delay
of 02 days in lodging of the F.I.R, which has not been explained
plausibly; that neither the applicant has been nominated in the F.I.R.
nor any specific role has been attributed to him; that co-accused,
namely, Porho Chandio, whose case is identical to that of the present
applicant, was granted bail by this Court vide order dated 26.09.2014
passed in Cr. B.A. No.S-349/2014; that the bail plea of the applicant
was declined by the trial Court on the ground that he was fugitive
from law and not on merit. It is well settled that bail cannot be
withheld mere on the ground of absconsion if the accused has good
case on merit for grant of bail. In the case in hand, the applicant has
not been nominated in the F.I.R. therefore, his involvement in
commission of the alleged offence requires probe at trial; that taking
into consideration all these facts and circumstances the case of the
applicant falls within the ambit of further inquiry as envisaged under
section 497(2) Cr.P.C.

7. In view of above, the applicant is granted bail subject to
furnishing solvent surety in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (Rupees two
hundred thousand) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the trial Court.

8. The findings made hereinabove are tentative in nature and the
trial Court shall not be influenced upon by any of the same while
deciding the main case on merits.

Bail application stands disposed of.
