Date of hearing 09.06.2017

Appellant-Petitioner: By Mr. Yaqoob Khan Marwat,

Advocate.

Respondent: By Mr. Hujjat Ullah Khan, Advocate.

State by Shahid Hameed Qureshi, Addl AG.
ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.--- _ Kaleemullah, the petitioner has

invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court, being
dissatisfied from order dated 22.04.2017 of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Lakki Marwat, with the following prayer:

“By accepting this revision petition,
the impugned orders of the learned
trial court dated 22.04.2017 may
kindly be set-asid. it is further prayed
that the learned trial Court may be
directed to allow the defence counsel
for further cross examination related

to the questions which could not be
-2-

asked due to impugned orders of the

learned trial Court.”

2. Short and relevant facts of the case are that

petitioner is an under trial prisoner in sessions case No.45 of

2017, vide F.I.R No.64 dated 24.02.2015 under sections

302/324/ P.P.C, Police Station Tajori.

3. Challan was submitted on 29.10.2015, thereafter

petitioner was formally indicted on 20.11.2015. The

prosecution produced and examined eleven (11) PWs. The

controversy which is the subject matter of the present revision

petition ensued during the cross-examination of PW-12,

Mutabar Khan, Investigating Officer of case, when the

following questions were asked from the said PW, which were

objected by counsel for the complainant and the objections

were sustained by the learned Trial Court, the above referred

questions are reproduced below.

“Question. Can you tell that you have
mentioned the fact of receiving a reference
chit from the constable on first day of
investigation in case diary No.1.

Objection by counsel for the complainant:
The question with regard to contents of

Zimnies cannot be put by defence unless and
-3-

until the same is referred by the witness
himself.
Order of the Court: Objection sustained.

Again another question of defence also met the same fate,

which is given below:

Question; did you write all the case diaries
on the spot or in P.S?

Objection by counsel for the complainant:
The question with regard to preparation of
Zimnies cannot be put by defense unless and
until the same is referred by the witnesses
himself.

Order of the Court: Objection sustained.

4. Before responding the controversy involved in the

revision, this would be appropriate to quote the relevant

provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and Articles of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.

172 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

172. Diary of proceedings in
investigation. (1) Every police-officer making an
investigation under this Chapter shall day by day
enter his proceedings in the investigation in a
diary, setting forth the time at which the
information reached him, the time at which he
began and closed his investigation, the place or

places visited by him, and a statement of the
-4-

circumstances ascertained through his

investigation.

(2) Any Criminal Court, may send for the
police-diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in
such Court, and may use such diaries not as
evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or
trial. Neither the accused nor his agents shall be
entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or
they be entitled to see them merely because they
are referred to by the Court; but if they are used by
the police-officer who made them, to refresh his
memory, if the Court uses them for the purpose of
contradicting such police-officer the provisions of
the Evidence Act, 1872 section 161 section 145 as

the case may be, shall apply.

155,157 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order.

155. Refreshing memory: (1) A witness may, while
under examination, fresh his memory by referring
to any writing made by himself at the time of the
transaction concerning which he is questioned, or
so soon afterwards that the Court considers it
likely that the transaction was at that time fresh in
his memory.

(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing
made by any other person, and read by the witness
within the time aforesaid, if when he read if he
knew it to be correct.

(3) Whenever a witness may refresh his memory by

reference to any document, he may with the
-5-

permission of the Court, refer to a copy of such
document:

Provided the Court be satisfied that there is
sufficient reason for the non-production of the
original.

(4) An expert may refresh his memory by reference
to professional treaties.

157. Right of adverse party as to writing
used to refresh memory: Any writing referred to
under the provisions of the two last proceeding
Articles must be produced and shown to the
adverse party if he requires it, such party may, if

he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.

5. Investigation officer of the case is not a formal

witness, he is person who has collected the evidence and has

placed the same before the Court. He has got a pivotal role

under the criminal Justice system. Reliance is placed on case

titled “Abdul Sattar Vs The State through Advocate General

NWFP” (2008 SCMR 684), wherein it is held that:

“There is no cavil to the proposition
that the Investigating Officer is not a
formal witness and his evidence
subject to the qualifying test to be
believed is at par to that of any other

prosecution witnesses”
-6-

6. More so, collection of evidence does not mean

collection of prosecution evidence it includes defence evidence

as well. Reliance is placed on case titled “Shad Mohammad

Khan Vs_ the State and another” (2013 YLR 71 Peshawar),

wherein it is held that:

6. It is the duty of Investigating
Officer to record the version of the
accused party in every case if
presented because the Investigating
Officer is not only duty bound to
collect evidence which favours the
prosecution. Investigating Officer is
obliged to conduct fair, impartial and
honest investigation and to collect
the evidence produced by _ the
prosecution as well as on behalf

of accused.

7. Under section 172(2) Cr.PC a Police officer, the

investigation officer of the case can refreshes his memory

before recording his statement and then under Article 140 of

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order (section 145 of the Evidence Act,) it is

the inalienable right of the accused to cross-examine the

witness to contradict or corroborate him as the case may be.
-7-

8. In the instant case, Motabar Khan, Investigation

officer, was under examination as PW-12 before the Court and

there is nothing on record to show that he was examined

without consultation of police file, once he consulted police file

then he is amenable to cross examination. The two questions

which were disallowed by the Court, the former was specific to

Zmini (daily diary) which in view of this Court was rightly

disallowed instead of referring to Zimni (daily diary) the

accused or his agent should have referred to the investigation of

case, while in latter one the witness should have been allowed

to answer the query of defence.

9. Be that as it may, once a witness refreshes his

memory defence is entitled to see the particular portion of case

diaries, at the same time cross-examiner is at liberty to ask

questions with regard to the investigation of case because the

ultimate is to arrive at a just and proper decision of the case

otherwise the Court can looked into the diaries and the

deposition of witness recorded at the trial and shall form its

own opinion without referring the daily diary in its order or

judgment as the case may be.
-8-
10. In view of above observations, this revision
petition is disposed of in the following terms that PW-12
Mutabar Khan be re-summoned as witness and defence be
allowed to cross-examine him with regard to the investigation
of case as provided by section 172(2) Cr.PC and 157 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Ordinance, order accordingly.

Announced.
