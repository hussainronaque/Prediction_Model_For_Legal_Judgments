JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Noor Muhammad, seeks bail in case FIR No.248 dated
08.09.2008, registered under sections 324/34 PPC and S.17
(4) Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood)
Ordinance, 1979, in Police Station Gumbat, wherein he
alongwith absconding co-accused Jehanzeb, is charged for
forcibly snatching cash amount and mobile sets from
complainant Khan Badshah and deceased Saeed Khan, as
well as committing the murder of deceased Saeed Khan
and attempting at the life of complainant thereby causing
him fire arm injuries.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. The petitioner has not been named by the
injured-complainant in his initial report rather he charged
two unknown culprits for commission of the offence. It

was Tariq Khan SI, who named the petitioner in initial

report with a version that on the report of fire shots, when
he was being attracted to the spot he noticed accused-
petitioner and co-accused Jahanzeb climbing on a nearby
hill towards Nizampur. Admittedly, said Tariq Khan S.I.
who handed down the report of complainant is not the
eyewitness of the incident. The complainant has not named
the petitioner in his initial report nor later on. No
identification parade of the petitioner has been conducted
through the complainant. The complainant has also not
disclosed the features and descriptions of the assailants in
his report. The petitioner has not confessed his guilt before
the competent court of law nor has anything incriminating
been recovered from his direct or indirect possession to
depict his connectivity with the commission of offence. On
tentative assessment of the material available on record and
discussed above, reasonable grounds exist which make the
case of the petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail.
Since on merits, the case of bail has been made out,
therefore, mere absconsion of the petitioner cannot be a
ground for refusal of bail as per ratio of judgment of
the Apex Court in case titled, “Mitho Pitafi Vs_The

State” 2009 S CM R 299

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail, provided he

furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the

record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
