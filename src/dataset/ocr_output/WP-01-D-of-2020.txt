For Petitioner: Mr. Siddiq Ullah Kundi, Advocate.

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through the instant
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 read with Section 561-A,
Cr.P.C., the petitioner has prayed for quashment of FIR
No.1241 dated 24.12.2019, registered under Sections

419, 420, 468, 471 PPC at police station Cantt:

D.I.-Khan.

2. Arguments ‘heard and the available record
perused.

3. Perusal of the record reveals that the

respondent No.6 submitted an application to the District
Police Officer, D.I.Khan against the petitioner for
registration of a criminal case, which was marked to
SHO police station Cantt: for inquiry. The matter was
inquired into and as a result, the aforementioned FIR

was registered against the petitioner.

4. The police has statutory duty to register
FIR regarding commission of any cognizable offence
under Section 154 Cr.P.C. and its purpose is only to set
the criminal law in motion. The provisions of Section
154 Cr.P.C are mandatory in nature and when an FIR is
registered, then the local police under section 156
Cr.P.C. have the statutory rights to investigate the case
and interference by the Court with duties of police is not
permissible under the law, as FIR is not an encyclopedia
of all the relevant facts, therefore, the image presented
by the FIR will be clarified when ali the incriminating
material is brought on record during investigation. If the
accused is found blameless during investigation, he can
be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of
sections 169/173 (3) Cr.P.C read with sections 249-
A/265-K Cr.P.C, besides pressing into service the
punitive proceedings by sending a complaint under
section 182 PPC against informer/ complainant of the
FIR. Therefore, it would be injustice, if, before the real
facts are collected by the investigating agency, the FIR
alleging the commission of cognizable offences, is
quashed.

5. No doubt, this Court has the powers to
quash FIR but in exceptional circumstances, i.e. where
the allegations made in the FIR, on the face of it, do not
constitute a cognizable offence, or the allegations made

in the FIR are so illogical on the basis of which no
-3-
prudent person can ever reach to a just conclusion that
there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the
accused, or where there is an express legal bar in any of
the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act, under
which a criminal proceeding is instituted.
In case titled Dr. Ghulam _Mustafa_Vs.
State, etc (2008 SCMR 76), it was held that:-
“High Court has no _ jurisdiction
whatsoever to take the role of the
investigating agency and to quash the
FIR, while exercising constitutional
power under Article 199 of the
Constitution or under section 561-A
Cr.P.C unless and until very exceptional
circumstances existed”.
6. In view of the above and after considering
the contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner
raised at the bar, we are of the firm opinion that factual
controversy is involved in the case, which necessitates
recording of evidence and this exercise cannot be done
in constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.
7. As the petitioner has alternate remedies for
redressal of his grievance in the shape of application
under sections 249-A or 265-K Cr.P.C., as the case may

be, which he can avail, therefore, this petition being

bereft of any merit, is dismissed in Jimine.
