SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- The complainant being aggrieved by the
judgment dated 06% March 2019 of the learned Sessions Judge,
Charsadda in Sessions Case No.134/SC, whereby the
accused/respondent was acquitted under Section 265-K Cr.P.C,
has preferred this appeal, on the following facts and grounds;

02. The complainant, who is father of the deceased namely
Muhammad Ayaz lodged a report to Sajeed Gul Khan ASI on the
crime scene, alleging that his son Muhammad Ayaz had been
brought in custody from District Jail, Mardan for producing him
in the Court of Tehsil Tangi. He and his son Yousaf had come
there to see him. The police took him out of judicial lock of the
Courts in their presence and were taking him to the Judicial
Magistrate, when they reached to the spot, in the meanwhile,
accused Aziz-ur-Rehman S/o Ghani-ur-Rehman took out his
pistol and fired at him due to which he was hit and died on the
spot. The accused Aziz-ur-Rehman was arrested by the police

alongwith weapon of offence, on the spot. It was alleged by him
|

that accused Aziz-ur-Rehman has committed murder of his son
at the behest of Nawaz S/o Gulab r/o Sra Shah and Zareef S/o
Imtiaz Khan r/o Berlin. The motive as set out in the crime report
is that sister of accused Aziz-ur-Rehman had come after his
deceased son to contract marriage with him. Besides him, the
occurrence was witnessed by his son namely Yousaf and police
party present on the spot, hence, the ibid FIR.

03. After arrest, the accused/respondent was put to trial. He
was acquitted under section 265-K Cr.P.C by the learned trial
court vide impugned judgment dated 15.12.2021. Being
aggrieved of the same, the appellant/complainant has preferred
the instant appeal.

04. It was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that
the accused has been acquitted under section 265-K Cr.P.C
before framing of the charge that too without affording the
complainant party to prove its case through evidence. He next
contended that the principal accused was acquitted on the basis
of compromise between the parties and not on merit, therefore,
the benefit of the said judgment cannot be extended to him, and
concluded his arguments by saying that acquittal order of the
accused/respondent was pre-mature and liable to be set aside
and case be remanded back to the court below for decision afresh
after recording pro and contra evidence.

05. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant/complainant and perused the record appended with

the appeal.

06. Having gone through the record, we find that the crime
report was lodged at the instance of Juma Khan, it was alleged by
him that murder of his son was committed by the accused Aziz-
ur-Rehman at the behest of his co-accused Nawaz and Zareef. On
the face of the record, we find that the prosecution has not placed
on record any evidence to prove or show that the
accued/respondent, who was not present on the crime scene,
aided, abetted or facilitated the principal accused Aziz-ur-
Rehman in his act of committing the crime, except, the oral
allegation of the compliant party, however, this allegation is not
based on legal evidence, but, is based upon presumption. It is the
duty of the prosecution to bring on record some tangible
material to connect the accused/respondent reasonably with the
offence of abetment, law does not allow to presume anything in
favour of the prosecution in the absence of any legal and
conclusive evidence in support of the charge leveled against him.
Section 109 PPC contemplates offence of abetment and the word
abetment is defined therein in the explanation to mean as under;

“An act or offence is said to be
committed in consequence of abetment,
when it is committed in consequence of
the instigation or in pursuance of the
conspiracy, or with the aid, which
constitutes the abetment.”

07. Itis, therefore, clear that abetment can be committed only
when there is positive evidence of either instigation or
conspiracy or intentional aid. If none of these three elements
stated above is available, then abetment does not stand proven.

In the instant case, mere bald allegation is not sufficient evidence
— ae)

to prove the fact that the accused/respondent either abeted or
conspired or intentionally aided in the crime.

08. For the discussion made hereinabove, we are of the view,
that elements of abetment or instigation as contemplated in
section 109 PPC is lacking.

09. Adverting to other questions, it appears from perusal of
section 265-K Cr.PC that the court has got ample power to acquit
the accused even if witnesses are not examined. Provisions of
section 265-K Cr.PC are meant to prevent the rigorous of a
protracted trial, when it is apparent from the record that there is
no probability of the accused being convicted of the offence and
further proceedings if allowed to continue would be an abuse of
the process of the court.

10. Even otherwise, the principal accused who is charged for
committing murder of the son of the complainant has already
been acquitted on the basis of compromise, and as discussed in
the preceding paras nothing would be achieved, if

accused/respondent is put to a full dressed trial.

11. Since it is an appeal against acquittal, we have kept in our
minds, the principles that govern the scope of interference by
this Court. Acquittal are not lightly displaced, and this Court will
have to see, whether acquittal is passed on wrong assumption of

facts, or proceed on a perverse process of reasoning.
12. We have gone through the impugned judgment and found
no illegality, irregularity or jurisdictional defect in it, calling for

interference.

13. For what has been discussed hereinabove, this appeal,
being bereft of merits, is hereby dismissed in limine.
