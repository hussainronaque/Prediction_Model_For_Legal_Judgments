Petitioner (s)...(Syed Salim Shah) by M/S Fazal-i-Haq Abbasi,
Shad Muhammad Khan, Mehdi Zaman Khan and
Tahir Hussain Lughmani, Advocates.......

Respondent (s) (Government of KPK etc) by Mr. Muhammad
Naeem Abbasi, Additional Advocate General,

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Syed Salim Shah,
petitioner, through his son, Syed Altaf Shah, has
invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court
under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, thereby, challenging his
detention under Section 3 (1) of the West Pakistan
Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960
(hereinafter referred to as 3 MPO) vide order of the
Deputy Commissioner, Abbottabad (respondent
No.2) bearing No.1/1/3MPO/141-44-RDR dated
Abbottabad the 30/01/2016. The detention order

under Section 3 MPO reads as follows;
“Whereas, it has been
made to appear to me through
District Police and the officers
of District Administration
Abbottabad that one:-

Saleem Shah s/o
Makhan Shah r/o Gharlanian
Tarnawai, Tehsil & District
Abbottabad staged a protest at
Fawara Chowk on 28.01.2016
for his personal political gains,
which resulted in a dreadful
traffic jam at KKH and the
commuters and other public
remained captive at the road
for about O05 hours,’ thus
choking the whole
communication network. He is
also involved in obnoxious,
anti-social activities and _ his
involvement in provoking the
general public for agitation and
disruption of the _ peaceful
environment of the district
cannot be_ ruled’ out _ in
prevailing law & order situation
of the district. His activities are
prejudicial to public safety and
maintenance of public order in
the district. Thus there is every
likelihood of breach of peace in
the District Abbottabad.
AND WHEREAS,
having considered the material
produced before me, I am of
the opinion that it is necessary
to prevent the said person from
acting in a manner prejudicial
to public safety and
maintenance of peaceful
atmosphere in the district
during the prevailing security
situation.

NOW, THEREFORE, I
Capt (R) Khalid Mehmood,
Deputy Commissioner
Abbottabad, in exercise of the
powers vested in me_ under
Section 3(1) of the West
Pakistan Maintenance of Public
Order Ordinance, 1960 do
hereby order that the_ said
named person may be detained
and confined in Central Jail D.I.
Khan with effect from the date
of execution of arrest for a

period of 30 days.”

3. The petitioner assailed the impugned
order, inter alia, on the grounds that he was a law
abiding citizen and was never involved in any anti-
social activity which was prejudicial to public safety

and maintenance of public order; that on 29.01.2016
at 10.00 P.M a large contingent of police entered in
to his house unlawfully and without any warrant of
arrest or search warrant and arrested him, but was
shown order under Section 3 MPO on the following
date i.e. 30.01.2016; that under the garb of an order
under Section 3 MPO which was not only based on
malafide and was totally false and frivolous, he was
sent to Central Jail Dera Ismail Khan; that protest
was staged in a peaceful manner; that a case under
Sections 341/147/149 PPC and 16 MPO etc had
already been registered vide FIR No.126 dated
28.01.2016 in Cantt: Police Station; that he had
already secured ad-interim pre-arrest bail from the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI,
Abbottabad; that another case vide FIR No.128 was
also registered against him on 29.01.2016, which
reflected malafide on the part of the District
Administration/respondents; that no notice was
served upon him prior to the detention order; that
the detention order was result of political pressure
exerted on the District Administration by his Political
Rivals; that prior to this incident there was nothing
against him to prove that he was undermining writ of

the government; that he was a well known person of
the locality and had contested election for a seat of
Provincial Assembly from his constituency; and that
he had, on the other hand, tried to control the mob
from turning violent.

3. The copy of FIR No.126, referred to in the
writ petition, would show that the petitioner was one
of the leaders of protesting public against shifting of
mini Adda, and the charge against him and others is
only of interrupting/blocking of smooth flow of traffic
on the main road, as nothing untoward happened
and the assembled public dispersed peacefully. The
petitioner, however, secured ad-interim pre-arrest
bail in the case from the Court of learned ASJ-VI,
Abbottabad on 29.01.2016. The other FIR No.128
dated 29.01.2016 shows resistance of family
members of the petitioner to his arrest in the earlier
case vide FIR No.126 dated 28.1.2014. The time of
occurrence has been shown as 2215 hours on
29.1.2016. It is noteworthy that even in the FIR it
has been mentioned by Parvez Khan SHO P.S Cantt:
that the petitioner showed him order of BBA in case
FIR No.126/16 but despite that he arrested the

petitioner under Section 3 MPO.
4. In response to Court notice, the learned
Additional Advocate General appeared and submitted
copy of the impugned order as well as record of case
FIR No.126 dated 28.01.2016. Arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional
Advocate General also heard, and record perused.

5. Apart from the impugned order under
Section 3 MPO showing at its top the date of
issueance as 30.01.2016, but, intriguingly, bearing
29.01.2016 as the date with signature of respondent
No.2, the only charge against the petitioner, as is
discernable from the impugned order, was that he
was involved in staging a protest at Fawara Chowk
on 28.01.2016 (written as 28.01.2015 in the order)
thereby causing traffic jam at KKH for about 5 hours.
The petitioner has further been charged for
obnoxious and_ anti-social activities and _ his
involvement in provoking the general public for
agitation and disruption of the peaceful environment
of the District in the prevailing law and order
situation. Needless to point out here that for the
offences enumerated in the impugned order, the
petitioner had already been booked not only under

PPC and other laws but also under Section 16 MPO
which pertain to dissemination of rumours and
making statements and speeches which are likely to
cause fear or alarm to the public or to any section of
the public or is likely to further any activity
prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of
public order. However, since cases already registered
against the petitioner are not subject matter of the
instant writ petition; the question for determination
before this Court would be that how the District
Administration could have resort to preventive
detention under Section 3 MPO when couple of cases
were already registered against the petitioner under
other provisions of law, including 16 MPO. The
answer is obviously in the negative.

6. The District Administration could justifiably
resort to preventive detention under Section 3 MPO
before the occurrence that too if there was likelihood
of breach of peace, but after the occurrence and
registration of case against the petitioner on the
basis of the same charges, there was no justification
for his preventive detention under Section 3 MPO,
especially when the petitioner had already secured
ad-interim pre-arrest bail in the case from the Court

of competent jurisdiction, to the knowledge of the
police/District Administration. The arrest of the
detenue despite his showing order of pre-arrest bail
in the case to the police speaks volumes about the
actual designs of the District Administration to
subject the petitioner to humiliation and harassment
under all circumstances, though the petitioner had
already surrendered to the process of law in the case
registered against him and was already on ad-
interim pre arrest bail. The date of issuance
mentioned at the top of the impugned order i.e.
30.01.2016 would amply demonstrate that the
impugned order was not shown to the petitioner or
served on him at the time of his arrest under section
3 MPO, as claimed in the impugned order, rather
there was no such order in existence at 2215 hours
on 29.01.2016. The conduct of the _ District
Administration, especially police department, has
thus left much to be desired. There can, possibly, be
no explanation, let alone plausible explanation, for
such an unlawful and malicious conduct, showing
scant regard for the process of law and Courts of
law. The District Administration, therefore, certainly
owe explanation for such an unsavory and uncalled

for conduct. In any case, the petitioner had a right to
be communicated the grounds of his preventive
detention, but the District Administration, having not
done so, acted in flagrant violation and disregard of
mandatory provisions of law. (PLJ 1992 Peshawar
19) (DB) (Abbottabad Bench).

6. Having said that, the orders and actions of
the District Administration, impugned herein, are not
condonable on any ground whatsoever. Therefore,
the impugned detention order of Syed Saleem Shah,
petitioner, under Section 3 MPO is declared illegal,
unlawful, without jurisdiction, without lawful
authority and perverse. Consequently, on the
acceptance of the writ petition, the respondents are
directed to forthwith release the petitioner from the
prison where he is confined at present under the

impugned detention order.
