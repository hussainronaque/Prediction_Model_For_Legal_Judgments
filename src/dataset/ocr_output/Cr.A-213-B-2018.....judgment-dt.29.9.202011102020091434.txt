SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The appellant Lal Sherin has
called in question the judgment dated 02.11.2018, authored by
learned Additional Sessions Judge, Takht-e-Nasrati, Karak,
whereby the appellant has been convicted under section 302(b)
P.P.C and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for life with
Rs.200000/-(two lac) compensation under section 544-A
Cr.P.C. to the legal heirs of deceased or in default thereof, to
undergo six months simple imprisonment. The benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C has also been extended to the convict.
The complainant Zarnab Gul has also filed criminal revision,
bearing Cr.R No. 55-B of 2018 for enhancement of sentence
awarded to the appellant. Since both the matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment, therefore, we intend to

dispose of the same through this common judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on 12.12.1998 at
09.30 hours, complainant Zarnab Gul (PW-4) alongwith his
brother Shahnaz Gul, in injured condition, reported the matter
to Rohan Gul ASI in the Police Station, to the effect that he
alongwith injured Shahnaz Gul, Haqnawaz were proceeding
towards ‘Cattle Fair for purchasing household articles, when
they reached Chowk Garrang Siraj Khel, in the meanwhile,
accused Lal Sherin emerged and started giving dagger blows to
Shahnaz Gul, as a result whereof, he sustained injuries and fell
down, while they being empty-handed could do nothing. The
accused after commission of offence decamped from the spot.
. Motive behind. the occurrence was stated to be a dispute over
thoroughfare. Rohangul Khan ASI (PW-5) reduced report of
the complainant in shape of F.I.R (Ex: PA), prepared injury
sheet of the injured Shahnaz Gul and sent him to the doctor
under the escort of constable Mushtaq (PW-10). On the same
date, after the injured was examined in the hospital, he was
referred to Peshawar for further treatment but unfortunately, on
the way, the injured succumbed to his injuries.

3. Initially, the accused absconded, hence, complete
challan was submitted against him under section 512 Cr.P.C,
and after recording statements of witnesses, the accused was
declared a Proclaimed Offender vide judgment dated

05.06.2002. Subsequently, on 07.5.2016, the accused was
-3-

arrested by the Kohat Police and was transferred to Central Jail,
Karak in the present case, where on commencement of trial, the
appellant was formally charge-sheeted on 17.10.2017, to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution to
prove its case produced and examined as many as 10 witnesses,
whereafter, the accused was examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, where he professed innocence and false implication,
however, he did not wish to be examined on oath as provided
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence
evidence. After hearing arguments from both the sides, the
learned trial Court vide impugned judgment dated 01.11.2018,
convicted the accused and sentenced him, as mentioned above,
hence, this appeal and the connected criminal revision.

4. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Addl: Advocate General representing the State were heard at
length and with their valuable assistance the record was gone
through.

5. The incident occurred on 12.12.1998 at 08.00 a.m.
when the deceased alongwith the complainant and eyewitness
Haq Nawaz were proceeding to cattle fair Takht-e-Nasrati,
Karak, to purchase house-hold articles, when they reached to
Garrang Chowk the accused/ appellant emerged and inflicted
dagger blows to the deceased. The injured was shifted to Police

Station Yaqoob Khan Shaheed, where the matter was reported
-4-

by the complainant Zarnab Gul, charging the accused/ appellant
for the murder of the deceased.

6. True, that single accused is charged for dagger
blows to the deceased, but equally true that the Courts of law
are not absolved of the liability to assess and reassess the
evidence available on file so to prevent miscarriage of justice,
particularly, when a single witness deposes against a single
accused.

7. The story of the prosecution begins with, that early
in the morning the complainant alongwith the deceased and PW
Haq Nawaz Khan, left their house for the cattle fair to purchase
household articles, it was at 08.00 a.m. when they reached to
the spot where the appellant emerged and inflicted dagger
blows to the deceased. The deceased, then injured, was taken to
the Police Station where the complainant reported the matter.
Though the Investigating Officer approached the spot on the
day of incident and recovered blood stained earth therefrom,
but no further proceedings were carried out and it was on
13.12.1998, when the site-plan was prepared on pointation of
the complainant, where different points were assigned to the
deceased, the eyewitnesses and the assailant, but what is of
prime importance, is the distance between the eyewitnesses and
the deceased which was stated to be 30 paces. What we are to

determine is to see as to whether the complainant was present

-5-

on the spot when the incident occurred and as to whether the
occurrence took place in the mode, manner and at the stated
time.

8. The deceased, then injured, was taken to the
Police Station where the matter was reported, but what we are
to see as to whether the conduct displayed by the complainant
was natural, as admittedly, the deceased by then was injured
and instead of taking him to the Police Station he should have
been taken to the hospital to save his life. The scribe was
examined as PW-5, who stated that on 12.12.1998 at about
09:30 hours, he was present in the Police Station when the
complainant Zarnab Gul, with the help of co-villagers, brought
the injured namely Shahnaz Gul, who was unconscious and that
it was the complainant who reported the matter. He further
stated that after drafting the murasila, he prepared the injury
sheet of the injured and sent him to the doctor for his medical
examination under the escort of constable Mushtaq Ahmad.
The complainant was examined as PW-4, who stated that soon
after the incident the injured was rushed to the Police Station
for report, but the officials present in the Police Station refused
to register the case and directed to take the injured to the
hospital for his medical examination, so they reached to the
hospital where the doctor examined the injured and prepared

his medico-legal report. The doctor was examined as PW-1,

-6-

who stated that the injured was brought by the co-villagers at
09:05 a.m. who was examined and his medico-legal report was
prepared. He further stated that at the time of examination, the
injured was fully conscious and oriented in time and space. It
increased our anxiety, that when the injured was taken to the
Police Station, why the police refused to register a case and
when injured was produced before the doctor prior to the report
then how the injury sheet was produced along with the injured,
when by then the report had not been made. We are surprised to
see that when the doctor was examined before the trial Court he
stated that he also endorsed the injury sheet but still the mystery
prevails, as the time of examination of the injured is given as
09:05 a.m., whereas the report was made at 09:30 a.m. if we
admit what the doctor stated as correct that the injured was
conscious and capable to talk then why he did not call the
police to pen down the report. This is surprising that when the
injured was oriented in time and space at 09:05 a.m. how did
the scribe tell that at 09:30 the injured was unconscious. This is
intriguing on part of the scribe that while reporting the matter,
he did not take it necessary to ask from the doctor as to whether
the injured was capable to talk and that what precluded the
scribe to take down the report with the injured as complainant.
This leads us nowhere, but to hold that the complainant was not

present with the deceased at the time of incident and it was on

-7-

information that he approached the concerned Police Station
and the matter was reported. We lurk no doubt in our mind that
first the injury sheet was prepared, the injured was examined
and thereafter, on arrival of the complainant, the matter was
reported and the appellant was charged. The medico-legal
report tells that the column meant for ‘who brought’ is left
blank, which helps in forming an opinion that the deceased
soon after receiving injuries was rushed to the hospital by the
nearby people and that the complainant was not present with
the deceased at the time of incident and also at the time when
the injured was examined by the doctor, had he been present his
name would have been mentioned in the relevant column and
even he would have reported the matter in the hospital where
the deceased then injured was examined. The complainant was
examined as PW-4, who stated that early in the morning all the
three left for the cattle fair to purchase household articles. The
prosecution is yet to establish that what collected all the three to
go together for purchase of house hold articles, when it was not
their routine. The complainant stated that when they reached to
the place of occurrence, the deceased was walking thirty (30)
paces ahead where the appellant emerged and inflicted repeated
dagger blows. The postmortem report tells that the deceased has
received ten dagger blows which took 5/6 minutes for the

appellant to do away with the deceased and it was thereafter he

-8-

fled away. We are shocked to see that when two real brothers
were just behind the deceased, what precluded them to rush and
rescue, instead waiting to let the convict/appellant to quench his
thirst. The witnesses displayed an abnormal conduct and they

could not succeed in establishing their presence on the spot.

In case titled “Pathan Vs The State (2015 SCMR
315), it is held that:

“The presence of witnesses on the crime
spot due to their unnatural conduct has
become highly doubtful, therefore, no
explicit reliance can be placed on their
testimony. They had only given
photogenic/photographic narration of the
occurrence but did nothing nor took a
single step to rescue the deceased. The
causing of that much of stab wounds on
the deceased loudly speaks that if these
three witnesses were present on the spot,
being close blood relatives including the
son, they would have definitely intervened,
preventing the accused from causing
further damage to the deceased rather
strong presumption operates that the
deceased was done to death in a merciless
manner by the culprit when he was at the
mercy of the latter and no one was there

for his rescue.”

-9-

9. The motive was stated to be a dispute over
thoroughfare which led to the death of the deceased but we are
to see as to who out of the three should have been the target as
the deceased was the youngest. The situation tells that had the
complainant been present on the spot he would have been the
prime target. Though the motive was stated to be a dispute over
thoroughfare and in that respect a daily diary was submitted
where the complainant is one Subaidar uncle of the deceased,
but neither the complainant of the daily diary was produced nor
the scribe, when so the daily diary has lost its utility to be
considered as a valid piece of evidence and as such cannot be
taken into consideration. The Investigating Officer did not
record the statement of any independent witness to support the
alleged motive and as such, the prosecution miserably failed to
establish the same. We know that prosecution is not bound to
setup motive in every case but once it is alleged and not proved,
then ocular account is required to be scrutinized with great

caution. It has been held in the case titled "Hakim Ali Vs. The

State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution though not
called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution must
suffer consequences and not the defence. The above view has
been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"

(PLD _1976_SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by their

,

-10-

lordships, that motive is an important constituent and if found
by the Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to
accept the prosecution story.

10. The prosecution struggled hard from the beginning
till the end to convince the Court and to establish on record that
the incident occurred at the stated time, but the doctor who
examined the injured and prepared his medico-legal report
stated that the probable duration of the injuries caused was six
hours. The time of incident is stated to be 08:00 a.m. whereas
the patient was examined at 09:05 a.m. which clearly suggests
that the incident did not occur at the stated time, though
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and it cannot
outweigh the direct evidence, however, when direct evidence is
not available then medical evidence can and should be
considered to benefit the accused and the present case is no
exception.

11. The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently
argued that the appellant remained absconder for sufficient long
time, but mere absconscion of accused is not conclusive guilt of
an accused person; it is only a suspicious circumstance against
an accused that he was found guilty of the offence. However,
suspicions after all are suspicions, the same cannot take the
place of proof, the value of absconcion, therefore, depends on

the facts of each case. In case titled "Liagat Hussain and

-1ll-

others Vs Falak Sher_and_ others" (2003 SCMR 6ll(a),

wherein it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable
explanation for being present on
the scene of occurrence and were
chance witnesses---Prosecution
case did not inspire confidence
and fell for short of sounding
probable to a man of reasonable
prudence---Abscondence of
accused in such circumstances
could not offer any useful
corroboration to the case of

prosecution"
12. The basic principle of criminal administration of
justice is that prosecution is under bounden duty to prove its
case beyond any shadow of doubt and if any reasonable doubt
arises in the prosecution case, the benefit of the same must be
extended to the accused not as a grace or concession, but as a
matter of right, the wisdom behind the same is that, lest no
innocent be punished. In view of unbelievable prosecution
story, unnatural conduct of witnesses and their presence,
contradiction among the statements of complainant, doctor and
the Investigating Officer, whole edifice of prosecution case has

razed to the ground, which benefits only and only the appellant.

-12-

This Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the
conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the
learned trial Court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge
by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released
forthwith from jail, if not required to be detained in connection
with any other case. Since the conviction and sentence awarded
to the appellant has been set aside, therefore, the connected

criminal revision, bearing Cr.R. No.55-B/2018 stands

dismissed.
13. Above are the reasons of our short order of the
even date.
