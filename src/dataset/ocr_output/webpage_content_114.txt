ABDUL MAALIK GADDI, J:    Through
this bail application, the applicant Hameed son of Muhammad Ali seeks
post-arrest bail in Crime No.123/2011 of Police Station Manghopir, registered under
Section 386, 511, 506/B, 384, 387 and 34 PPC from this Court, as his similar
request was turned down by the learned trial Court vide order dated 30.10.2013.
 
2.         The brief facts of the prosecution
case are that complainant lodged FIR stated therein that he is doing business
of making block and his factory Glorious Enterprises is situated at Walgi Goth
Manghopir Road where many labours are working. From last two months one person
Hameed alongwith 3/2 persons who are identified by their faces so many time came
to factory of complainant and demanded Bhatta but complainant refused to pay
the same. On the fateful day, complainant alongwith workers was busy in work at
5.00 pm, all of sudden applicant came and developed fear in his labours by
showing pistol and disclosed that he belonged to PPPP Aman Committee and demanded
Rs.25,000/- or to close the factory and in case of none payment of Bhatta they
will lost their lives so also threatened for kidnapping him and his driver Ali
Muhammad who went outside factory. Accused Hameed stopped him and threatened
the driver that if his boss has not given amount he will not allow to run the
vehicle in the way of Goth. Hence, this FIR.
3.         I have heard the learned counsel
for the applicant, learned APG and have gone through the case file.
4.         Learned counsel for the applicant
has argued that applicant/accused was supplying material of making block and
cement etc and during such job with complainant dispute arose between them who
on account of such enmity involved the applicant/accused in this crime. He
further argued that name of any person is not mentioned in the FIR who were
present when applicant/accused entered in the factory of complainant. He
further argued that no specific role has been assigned to the accused in the
alleged crime and complainant did not lodge any report.
5.         Learned APG, vehemently opposed
the grant of bail to the applicant/accused on the ground that name of the accused
transpires in the contents of FIR and prosecution witnesses have implicated him
in the alleged commission of crime. He pointed out that PWs namely Arshad,
Jumma, Ali Muhammad, Samiullah and Shaheen have implicated the accused in the
alleged commission of crime as alleged against him. He further contended that
incidents of extortion of money have become common and such crimes to be curbed
with iron hands. He further contended that ample evidence is available on
record against the accused to connect him in the alleged commission of crime. 
6.         I have given my anxious thought to
the contentions raised at bar and have perused the police file. From perusal of
record, it appears that the alleged incident took place on 8.5.2011 and the
same was reported on the same day without any delay. The applicant is nominated
in the FIR with specific allegation that on the day and time of the incident he
came inside the factory of the complainant and demanded Bhatta in presence of
P.Ws namely Arshad, Jumma, Ali Muhammad, Samiullah and Shaheen. These P.Ws in
their statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C have implicated the
applicant/accused in the commission of offence. These P.Ws appears to no
inimical terms with the applicant, therefore, their statement at this stage of
the case cannot be ignored. Record further reveals that this applicant/accused
is fugitive from law since last two years and subsequently he was arrested in
this case on 8.10.2013. His absconsion in presence of evidence available on
record support the prosecution case. As per record, the applicant is involved
in a case of extortion of money and this type of crime is now-a-days
increasing. Besides the evidence under which the present applicant is involved
falls within the prohibitory section of 497 Cr.P.C, therefore, at this stage
the applicant has failed to make out a case of bail.
7.         In view of the reasons enumerated
above, I am of the considered view that the applicant has failed to make out a
case for bail, accordingly, this bail application stands dismissed. However,
the observations made hereinabove are tentative in nature and only for disposal
of this bail application. 
8.         Since the applicant is in jail for
the last few months, therefore, I direct the trial Court to examine the
material witnesses i.e. complainant and mashir of the case within two months
from the date of receipt of this order and thereafter the applicant will be at
liberty to move fresh bail application before the learned trial Court, who will
decide the same in accordance with law.
