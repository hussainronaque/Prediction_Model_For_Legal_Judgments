JUDGMENT
setae
AHMAD ALI, J. Through the appeal in hand, the
appellant (Usman Shah s/o Samar Gul) has
questioned the judgment of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-IX/Judge, Special Court, Peshawar
dated 09.07.2019, delivered in case FIR No.471
dated 09.05.2015 under section 9-C CNSA, Police
Station, Chamkani (Peshawar), whereby he was
convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for six
years with fine of Rs.100, 000/- (one lac) or in
default whereof to suffer 6 months S.I with benefit

under section 382-B Cr.P.C extended.
2. Brief facts of the case, as per prosecution’s
version, are that the complainant Riaz Khan SI,
having received information regarding smuggling of
huge quantity of narcotics from tribal territory to
Punjab, through motorcar bearing registration No.N-
4673/Karachi, laid Nakabandi. In the meanwhile, the
car in question arrived, which was stopped. Same
was driven by the present appellant. Search of the
vehicle led to the recovery of 8 kgs charas contained
in 8 packets. 5/5 gram from each packet were
separated for chemical analysis by FSL and sealed
into parcel No.1 to&8 whereas the remaining
contraband was sealed in another parcel No.9 with a
monogram of ‘MK’ affixed thereon. On the basis of
Murasila, the instant FIR was lodged against the
accused.

3. On completion of investigation, complete
challan against the present accused-appellant was
submitted in Court where he was charge-sheeted,
however, he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
The prosecution in order to prove its case, produced
and examined as many as six witnesses whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded, wherein, he

professed his innocence.
4. The learned Trial Court, after conclusion of
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge and,
while recording his conviction, sentenced him as
mentioned above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant
has filed the instant appeal before this Court.

5. Arguments heard and record gone through.

6. Allegation against the appellant is that, 8 kgs
charas were recovered from the motorcar driven by
him. To reach a right conclusion, the testimony of
witnesses is very necessary to be thoroughly
scrutinized.

7. The seizing officer while appearing before the
Court as PW-2, deposed in his Court’s statement that
after recovery of contraband, he separated samples
for FSL purpose and sealed in parcels No.1 to 8 and
remaining stuff in parcel No.9 with a monogram of
“MK” which, he categorically admitted that same is
not pertained to his name and in fact the same stands
for Mukhtiar Khan, SI, who was stated to be
present with the complainant. The alleged recovery
seems to be doubtful, rather hints at something to be
planted by complainant, because said Mukhtiar Khan

SI was never cited as a witness during proceedings
in the instant case. Reliance could be placed on

2015 SCMR 291.

8. This witness, after few moments, in his cross
examination contradicted his own statement by
deposing that “Mukhtiar Khan SI was present in
the PS at that very time. The MK monogram was
lying with me in the official van’. Be that as it may,
the Seizing Officer, pursuant to spy information,
should have been required to have his own
monogram with the letters “RK” in his possession to
have strengthened and substantiated his version, but
he disrupted the episode in a casual manner. This
witness further deposed that;

“Wali Khan ASI is the IO in the
instant case. The IO came to the spot
but I have nothing handed over on the
spot. The witness volunteered that I
myself brought the accused along with
the case property to the PS and
handed over to the Moharrir of the PS
at about 16:40 hours”.

From the above statement of PW-2, though it
transpires that he handed over the case property to
the Moharrir of the PS, but, said Moharrir was not
produced before the Court so as to support the
version of the complainant and to have to depose
about the safe custody of the case property. The

prosecution even did not produce the Register No.19
of the PS so as to prove that the case property was
ever kept in Malkhana of the PS. In this way, the
prosecution, has wasted the best evidence available
with it to have been established the safe custody of
recovered contraband. It is also on record that one of
the PW, namely, Shah Khalid constable, who was
the 2™ marginal witness to the recovery memo was
abandoned by the prosecution for reasons best
known to them. So, in the situation, not only adverse
inference under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order 1984 can be safely drawn, but the legal
inference could also be drawn that if the said
witnesses had entered into the witness box then they
would not have supported the prosecution case. In
this regard wisdom can be safely derived from case
law reported in NLR 2015 SCJ 121 & PLD 2016
SC 17.

9. Witness to the recovery memo is PW-3
(Salman Khan No.1709), but even this witness has
not stated anything about the samples and remaining
contraband as to whether the complainant after
seizure of the said contraband had handed over the

same to someone else or otherwise. PW-4 is Ghulam
Hiader SI, he stated in his examination in chief as
under:-

“On receiving the murasila from the
complainant Riaz Khan _ SI _ through
Constable Sulaiman No.1709. I incorporated
its contents of the murasila into shape of FIR
Ex.PA. .....

XXX....Nil (opportunity given)”

This witness has also brought nothing on record
regarding receipt of any case property along with
murasila.

10. Besides, PW-2 though stated in _ his
examination in chief that he sent the samples (sealed
parcels No. 1 to 8) to FSL vide application
Ex.PW2/2, but there is no name/number of official
mentioned therein. It was the FSL report (Ex.PF)
which disclosed that the samples were sent to FSL
on 12.05.2015 through FC Wali 4336, but to our
utter surprise, no such official was produced before
the learned Trial Court to ascertain that when and
through whom he was handed over the said samples
for taking the same to FSL.

11. Record further reveals that the contraband was
recovered on 09.05.2015 whereas the samples were
received in FSL on 12.05.2015 with a considerable
delay of about three days. The prosecution could not

offer any plausible explanation for such delay.
Reliance is placed on case titled “Ikramullah_and

others Vs the State reported in 2015 SCMR 1002”
wherein the Apex Court has held that;

“No such police official was produced before Trial
Court to depose about safe custody of samples
entrusted to him for being deposited in office of
Chemical Examiner---Prosecution was not able to
establish that after alleged recovery of substance so
recovered was either kept in safe custody or that
samples were taken from recovered substance had
safely been transmitted to office of Chemical
Examiner without the same being tampered with or
replaced while in transit---Prosecution failed to prove
its case against accused persons beyond reasonable
doubt” .

12. Thus, prosecution has not only miserably
failed to establish the safe custody of the case
property, but also failed to prove the safe
transmission of the samples to FSL. In a case where
safe custody of the recovered substance or safe
transmission of samples of the recovered substance
was not proved by the prosecution through
independent evidence, it could not be concluded that
the prosecution had succeeded in establishing its
case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
Wisdom can be derived from the case law reported

in 2019 SCMR 608.

13. Apart from the above, the vehicle, from which
the alleged recovery was effected, was not produced

before the Court and was not exhibited during trial.
The case property had not been produced by the
police before the trial court without any justification,
which shows that the police had malice towards the
accused regarding recovery of the contraband. Its
production before the court was the primary duty of
the police in order to bring home the guilt of the
accused. Non-production of the case property was
fatal to the prosecution's case, and the same had
destroyed the very foundation of the case, which
created a dent in the prosecution case causing
serious doubt with regard to the occurrence.
Reference is made to case law reported in 2017
P.Cr.L.J 14.

14. There is other glaring point in the instant case
that whole the proceedings were conducted by PW-6
(Wali Khan ASI) in violation of the provision of
section 21 of the CNSA, 1997 despite the fact that,
according to the statement of PW-6, there were two
other police official in the rank of SI were posted in
Investigation Wing of said police station. Such
conduct of the prosecution, while dealing with a
heinous case, caused considerable loss to its case
because neither any site plan nor any card of arrest

was prepared. Had it been, same would have been
found on file to support the prosecution story. In a
case reported in 2018 SCMR_ 2039, the august

Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that;

“To distinguish where the directions of the legislature
were imperative and where they were directory, the
real question was whether a thing had been ordered
by the legislature to be done and what was the
consequence, if it was not done. Some rules are vital
and went to the root of the matter, they could not be
broken; others were only directory and a breach of
them could be overlooked provided there was
substantial compliance. Duty of the court was to try
to unravel the real intention of the legislature. Such
exercise entailed carefully attending to the scheme of
the Act and then highlighting the provisions that
actually embodied the real purpose and object of the
Act. Provision in a statute was mandatory if the
omission to follow it rendered the proceedings to
which it related illegal and void, while a provision
was directory if its observance was not necessary to
the validity of the proceedings. Some parts of a
statute, thus, may be mandatory whilst others may be
directory. Furthermore certain portion of a
provision, obligating something to be done, may be
mandatory in nature whilst another part of the same
provision, may be directory, owing to the guiding
legislative intent behind it. Even parts of a single
provision or rule may be mandatory or directory. In
another context, whether a statute or rule be termed
mandatory or directory would depend upon larger
public interest, nicely balanced with the precious
right of the common man.”

It was also astonishing that IO of the case disclosed
that whole the proceedings were carried out inside
the police station, which suggests that the witnesses
produced by the prosecution were either not present
on the spot or they were not narrating the actual truth
about the occurrence

15. As, the prosecution has not only failed to
establish any connection of appellant with vehicle in
question but has also brought nothing on record in

respect of any nexus of the appellant with the alleged
10

contraband, therefore, he cannot be held responsible
for the same. It seems that the prosecution, for
saving the neck of actual culprit, has falsely dragged
the present appellant in the instant case.

16. Keeping in view the contradictions on
material points occurred in the statements of PWs
and handling of the contraband as hinted above
created doubts in the prosecution case qua its
recovery and safe custody, which suggests that
occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged by the prosecution.

17. The above discussion has led this Court to
believe that the learned trial court has erred in
appreciating the case evidence in its true perspective.
It has been held, time and again by the superior
courts, that a slightest doubt occurs in the
prosecution case is sufficient to acquit an accused.
For extending the benefit of doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. Single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt
of accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a
matter of grace or concession, but as a matter of

right. Reliance could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230,
11

2011 SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, 1984 PLD SC
433, 2012 MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR 1825, 2008
P.Cr.L.J 376, 1994 PLD Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD
Peshawar 01, 1999 P.Cr.L.J_ 1087, 1997 SCMR
449, 2011 SCMR 820 & 2006 P.Cr.L.J SC 1002.
The conclusions drawn by the learned trial Court are
not borne out of the case evidence, therefore, the
impugned judgment is not sustainable.

18. For what has been discussed above and while
extending benefit of doubt to the appellant, instant
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set
aside and he is acquitted of the charge levelled
against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not
required to be detained in any other case.

19. Above are the reasons of short order of even
date.
