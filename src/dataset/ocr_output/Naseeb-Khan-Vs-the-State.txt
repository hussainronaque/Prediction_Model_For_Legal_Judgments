JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Naseeb Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No.418 dated
02.09.2007, registered under sections 302/324/148/149
PPC, in Police Station Mattani, Peshawar wherein he
alongwith co-accused is charged for committing the
murder of Shahidullah deceased, with firearm on a motive
of previous blood feud. In addition to complainant the
incident is stated to have been witnessed by other persons
present there.

2. Complainant Zubaid Ullah despite service
not in attendance. Perusal of record shows that he also did
not turn up before the learned lower court in bail petition
of the petitioner, therefore, this petition cannot be kept
pending for indefinite period, just to procure the attendance
of complainant, who otherwise is not interested to contest

the proceedings.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned Standing counsel for the State heard.
Record perused.

3. It appears from the record that a general role
of firing has been attributed to seven accused including the
petitioner, while as per autopsy report, the deceased had
sustained single firearm injury. The other two injured
passersby have not come forward to charge the petitioner
for commission of the offence. It is yet to be determined
during trial as whose shot out of the seven accused proved
fatal and similarly the question of the common object of
the co-accused in the commission of offence is yet to be
answered by the prosecution during trial. Co-accused Noor
Muhammad, whose role is identical to that of the petitioner
has already been released on bail by this court vide order
dated 09.07.2015 in Cr.Misc.BA No.1137-P/2015,
therefore, on the rule of consistency the petitioner is also
entitled to concession of bail. Mere abscondence of the
petitioner, when otherwise, he is entitled to concession of
bail, would not obstruct his way of bail. Guidance in this
regard may be derived from case titled, “Qamar alias

Mitho Vs the State and others” (PLD 2013 Supreme Court

222).

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
5. Before parting with the judgment, I would
like to refer to the bail refusing order of the learned lower
Court dated 14.10.2015, which being suffering from lack
of reasons and against the principles governing the grant
and refusal of bail, is a non-speaking order. The learned
lower court failed to meet the arguments advanced at the
bar, particularly, by the learned counsel for the petitioner
in respect of release of co-accused on bail by this Court,
whose role was identical to that of the petitioner. The
learned lower court has not differentiated the role of the
petitioner from that of the accused released on bail by this
Court. For ready reference, the operative part of order of
learned lower court is reproduced below:-
“The tentative assessment of the case record
shows that the accused has directly been
nominated in the FIR. The offence carrying
capital punishment. The medical report also

supports the version of prosecution. There is

motive of blood feud enmity between the
parties. In view of the above discussion, the
accused/petitioner is not held entitled or
release on bail, hence bail petition is
dismissed”.
The bail granting or refusing order of a court is always
required to be based on sound reasons in light of tentative
assessment of the record and not to be passed in vacuum.
Similarly, the judgments of the superior Courts under the
Constitution are binding upon the subordinate Courts in
cases having identical facts and circumstances and any
deviation therefrom would frustrate the ends of justice. The
Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court is directed to
send copy of this judgment to learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II, Peshawar for future guidance, as well as learned
Sessions Judge, Peshawar, who shall circulate the same
among the Additional Sessions Judges, Posted in
Peshawar, with intimation to this Court.

Announced
10.11.2015.
