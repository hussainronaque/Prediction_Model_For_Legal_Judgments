SYED MUHAMAMD  ATTIQUE SHAH, _J:-

This appeal is directed against the judgment dated
23.05.2017 recorded by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V / Judge Special Court, Manschra, in case
FIR No.688 dated 03.07.2013 under Section 9-C CNS
Act, 1997, Police Station City, Manschra, wherein,
the present appellant Asad Khan was convicted under
section 9-C CNSA and sentenced to one year
Rigorous Imprisonment and was held liable to pay a
fine of Rs.15,000/- or in default thereof, he has to
sutfer further one month Simple Imprisonment.

2. The allegation against the appellant, as
narrated in PLR (Ex.PA/L) is that he was found in

possession of 1100 grams of ‘charas’ by
nN

Inspector/S11O/complainant Amjad Ilussain (PW-5)
on 03.07.2013 and he was arrested in the case. After
investigation, challan was submitted against the
appellant. The appellant was charged for the offence
under section9-C CNSA, but he did not plead guilty
and claimed trial. he prosecution examined six
witnesses in support of its case against the appellant.
4. The appellant was examined under Section
342 Cr.P.C., wherein, he pleaded innocence and false
implication. He wished not to produce defence
evidence or to give statements on Oath.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently
argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the
case against the present appellant; that nothing was
recovered from possession of the appellant; and that
the recovery of ‘charas’ from possession of appellant
was not established in accordance with law.

6. In rebuttal, learned AAG opposed the
contentions of the learned defence counsel and
contended that the recovery of ‘charas was duly made
from possession of the appellant, which was duly
proved through testimony of witnesses having no

enmity with him.
pee)

%. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
appellant and learned Assistant AG heard and the
available record perused.

8. Perusal of record would reveal that PW-4
Ishtiaq No.471 had furnished his testimony before the
learned trial Court as marginal witness to recovery
memo E:x.PW 4/1 through which the complainant of
the case, Amjad Ilussain, SHO has recovered alleged
contraband from possession of the appellant. It is
evident from record of the case that appellant was
shown to have been apprehended from College
‘Dohrah’ near ‘Mama Hotel’, at 18.40 hours on
03.07.2013, which is admittedly a busy place having
markets and main KKII road. Hlowever, no
independent person was associated with the said
recovery. Morcover, the alleged recovery was
effected on 03.07.2013, whereas, it was received in
VSL, Peshawar, on 26.07.2013 i.e. after twenty four
days, as is evident from report of VSL, (x.PZ).
Nothing is available on record of the case as to where
the alleged samples were lying for twenty four long
days after its recovery, which raised doubt regarding

sale custody of the material and no explanation is
forthcoming regarding its late dispatch to the VSL,
Peshawar. No explanation on the part of the
prosecution is forthcoming on record qua such
considerable delay in dispatch of parcels. ‘The
previous conviction of the appellant could not be
established by the prosecution in accordance with law.
Vhus, the above glaring lapses/dents in the
investigation create serious doubt in the prosecution
case and benefit of the same should have been
extended to the appellant. It is well settled law that
even a single doubt, if found reasonable, would entitle
the accused person to acquittal and not a combination
of several doubts. Reliance is placed on case titled

‘Ghulam Qadir Vs. The State’ (2008 SCMR 1221),

wherein, it has held that:

“It needs no reiteration that for the
purpose of giving benefit of doubt to an
accused person, more than one
infirmity is not required, a_ single
infirmity crating reasonable doubt in
the mind of a reasonable and prudent
mind regarding the truth of charge-
makers the whole case doubtful.
Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does
not absolve the prosecution to prove its

case against the accused beyond any
wn

shadow of doubt in this duty does not

change or vary in the case.”

Reliance is also placed on case law reported as_2009

SCMR 230, 1995 SCMR 1345, 2017 SCMR 596 and

2017 SCMR 709.
9. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this appeal is accepted, the conviction
and sentence awarded to the appellant vide the
impugned judgement dated 23.05.2017 passed by
learned Judge Special Court, Manschra, are sect aside
and he is acquitted of the charge leveled against him
in this case.

The appellants being on bail stands
discharged from the liability of bail bonds.

Announced.
