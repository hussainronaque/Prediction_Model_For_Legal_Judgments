JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

This appeal calls in question the legality and

propriety of judgment dated 10.03.2015, passed by

The sentences have been directed

to be run concurrently. Benefit of

Section 382-B Cr.P.C. has been

extended to the appellants/convicts.

2. On 23.06.2014 at 01.10 am. Fazal

Khaliq complainant, in injured condition, in

company of injured Ikram , reported to local police

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

3

in RHC Yar Hussain, that on the night of incident

he alongwith PW Ikram, came out of their Hujra to

purchase snuff (Naswar) from the nearby shops,

but the same were found closed and on their return

to the Hujra when they reached the crime spot,

Mera Khan, Hussain and Naeem (appellants-

convicts herein), duly armed with firearm, present

there, opened fire at them, with the intention to

commit their Qatl-e-Amd, as a result they both got

hit while the accused decamped from the spot. A

previous blood feud enmity has been alleged as

motive behind the crime.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded

in the shape of murasila Exh.PW.6/1 by Mukhtiar

Khan ASI (PW.5), who sent it to Police Station on

the basis of which FIR No.296 dated 23.06.2014

under sections 324/34 PPC was registered at Police

Station Yar Hussain against the appellants. He

prepared injury sheets of the injured and left them

4

under the escort of Qadar Nawaz Constable

No.563 for the purpose of medical examination.

4. Dr. Irtaza Ajmal Khan (PW.3),

examined injured Ikram on 23.06.2014 at 1.00 a.m.

and found an entry wound on his right flank about

1 x % inches in size with charring marks having

corresponding exit near umbilicus region about 4 x

2 inches in size. On the same day he also examined

injured Abdul Khaliq and found firearm entry

wound on his left arm about 1 x % inches in size,

with charring marks having exit wound on left arm

about % x % inches in size on posterior interior

side.

5. Mira Khan SI (PW.9), rushed to the

spot and prepared site plan Exh.PW.9/1 in light of

torch on the pointation of complainant Fazal

Khaliq. During spot inspection he secured blood

from the place of injured Fazal Khaliq with the

help of cotton and 30 empties of 7.62 bore and an

empty of 30 bore, vide recovery memo

5

Exh.PW.8/1. He took into possession the

bloodstained garments of the injured, placed on

file the medico legal reports of the injured, and

FSL report Exh.PW.9/3, initiated proceedings

under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against the

accused, recorded statements of the PWs under

section 161 Cr.PC. and after completion of

investigation, handed over case file to SHO, who

submitted challan in terms of $.512 Cr.P.C. Later

on, all the three accused/appellants were arrested,

he interrogated them and recorded their statements

under section 161 Cr.PC. and after completion of

investigation, submitted supplementary challan

against them.

6. On receipt of challan by the learned

Trial Court, appellants were summoned and

formally charge sheeted, to which they pleaded not

guilty and claimed Trial. To bring home the guilt

of appellants, prosecution examined as many as ten

witnesses. After closure of the prosecution

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

6

evidence, statements of the appellants were

recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they

denied the prosecution allegations and professed

their innocence. They, however, declined to be

examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or

to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of

trial, learned Trial Court, after hearing both the

sides, convicted and sentenced the appellants as

mentioned above.

7. Learned counsel for the appellants

argued that the occurrence is odd hours of the

night and complainant, has not disclosed any

source of light on the spot nor has any source of

light been shown in the site plan nor taken into

possession during spot inspection by the I.O.,

therefore, identification of the appellants is highly

doubtful; that complainant-injured Fazal Khaliq

has been abandoned by the prosecution while the

testimony of PW Ikram Khan injured does not find

any corroboration from the site plan or medical

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

7

evidence; that mere stamp of injuries on his person

cannot be a certificate that whatever he is speaking

would be the truth. He contended that the

impugned judgment being against the law facts

and evidence available on record is liable to be set

aside.

8. Despite issuance of process,

complainant Fazal Khaliq did not turned up. He

reportedly is absconding in some other criminal

case that’s why he has also been abandoned during

trial. In these eventualities, this appeal cannot be

kept pending for indefinite period on the ground

to procure the attendance of the complainant,

therefore, learned AAG was asked to assist the

court on behalf of the State as well as complainant.

9. Learned AAG contended that the

appellants are directly charged in a promptly

lodged report; that injured PW Ikram Khan has

furnished straightforward and confidence inspiring

account of the incident, which is corroborated by

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

8

recovery of blood and recovery of empties of two

kinds of weapons; that medical evidence supports

the prosecution version. He while supporting the

impugned judgment sought dismissal of the

appeal.

10. I have heard the respective submissions

advanced from both the sides and perused the

record carefully.

11. On the face of record on file, I entertain

no doubt about commission of the offence on the

date, time and place, as alleged by the prosecution

as well as the injuries sustained by complainant

and PW Ikram Khan. What disturbs my mind to a

great extent is my serious reservation about the

identification of the assailant/ assailants and the

mode and manner of the incident. The occurrence

is nocturnal taken place in the month of June, 2014

at 00.15 hours. Injured-complainant Fazal Khaliq

(abandoned during trial), has not disclosed about

availability of any source of light whether electric

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

9

or moon on the spot at the time of incident, in

which he identified the appellants. Similarly, no

source of light has been shown by the I.O. in the

site plan nor any such source has been recovered

therefrom. Rather, admission of Mira Khan SI

(PW.9)/I.0., qua preparation of the site plan in

torch light, squarely establishes non-availability of

light on the spot. Had there been any light, he

would not have used torch while inspecting the

spot. I did not found any justifiable explanation to

remove my reservation about the identification of

the assailant/ assailants. In the site plan

complainant has been shown at Point No.1 while

PW Ikram Khan as PW.2 and the appellants at

points No.3 to 5. The distances between the three

appellants and the two injured PWs have been

shown from 10 feet to 22 feet, but medical

evidence negates this stance of the prosecution,

wherein Dr. Irtaza Ajmal Khan (PW.3), who

examined both the injured, observed charring

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

10

marks over the wounds of the two injured, which

proves that both the injured have been fired from a

very close range/ distance not more than a feet.

Thus, medical evidence belies the ocular version of

PW Ikram Khan. No doubt, in hurt cases,

conviction can be recorded on the solitary

statement of an injured witness provided it rings

true and is supported by medical evidence, but

such is not the situation before me in the instant

case. Though presence of injured PW Ikram cannot

be denied having injuries on his person, but at the

same time he cannot be held as a credible and

truthful witness on mere ground of injuries on his

person. Therefore, I am firm in my view that the

incident has not taken place in the mode and

manner as alleged by the prosecution. Moreso,

departure of the two injured from their Hujra for

the purpose of buying snuff (answer) at mid night,

is also behind my comprehension. The findings of

the learned Trial Court qua conviction of the

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

11

appellants for attempting at the life of injured

complainant Fazal Khaliq and his injures, seems

very strange as he did not appeared in the witness

box and it is settled law that FIR by itself is not a

substantive piece of evidence, unless proved by its

maker/ lodger, hence, the exercise adopted by the

learned Trial Court is squarely against the law and

principle of appreciation of evidence.

12. For what has been discussed above,

the prosecution has miserably failed to bring home

the guilt of the appellants through cogent and

confidence inspiring evidence beyond reasonable

doubts. Rather, the prosecution evidence,

discussed above, is suffering from material

contradictions and discrepancies, creating serious

doubts about the guilt of the appellants, benefit of

which is to be extended to the appellants not as a

matter of grace or concession but as a matter of

right as according to golden principle of benefit of

doubt; one substantial doubt would be enough for

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

12

acquittal of the accused. The rule of benefit of

doubt is essentially a rule of prudence, which

cannot be ignored while dispensing justice in

accordance with law. Conviction must be based on

unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and

any doubt arising in the prosecution case, must be

resolved in favour of the accused. The said rule is

6

based on the maxim “ it is better that ten guilty
persons be acquitted rather than one innocent
person be convicted” which occupied a pivotal
place in the Islamic Law and is enforced strictly in
view of the saying of the Holy Prophet (PBUH)
that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a
criminal is better than his mistake in punishing an
innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be
derived from the judgments of the apex court in
case titled, >Muhammad Khan and another Vs

the State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and case titled,

“Muhammad Ikram Vs the State” (2009 SCMR

13

13. Accordingly, I allow this appeal, set

aside the conviction and sentences of the

appellants-convicts, recorded and awarded by the

learned Trial Court vide impugned judgment dated

10.03.2015 and hereby acquit them of the charges

leveled against them. They be set at liberty

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

14. These are reasons of my short order of

even date which read as under:-

For reasons to be recorded later,

this appeal is allowed, conviction

and sentences of the appellants (1)

Mera Khan (2) Naeem Khan and (3)

Bilal Hussain, recorded and awarded

acquitted of the charge. They be set

at liberty forthwith, if not required

in any other case.

Announced.
