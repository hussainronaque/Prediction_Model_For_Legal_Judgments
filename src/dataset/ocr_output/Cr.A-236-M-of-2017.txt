8 In order to comprehend the case and
complicity of the Appellant in the gruesome murder
of almost the entire family i:e five persons from one
family, it would be important to first refer to the
crime scene. According to the site plan Ex.PW-14/1,
the occurrence has taken place on an un-metaled
road leading from the main road towards other
villages including village Tattar. On one side of the
road there is shawara mountain (pasture) whereas
on the other side there is also barren mountain.
There is no residential area surrounding the place of
occurrence, however, according to the statements of
witnesses it is situated at a distance of 500/600 yards
from the house of PW Anwar Khan (the complainant
bridegroom ) which can be covered in 10 minutes
while walking on foot whereas the house of PW
Naimat Ullah (brother of the bride) is at a distance
of one and a half kilometer from the spot. In this
regard, Naimat Ullah (PW-6) has confirmed in his

cross-examination that:

“The house of complainant Anwar Khan is at a
distance of about 10/15 minutes from the spot
while my house at a distance of about one and a
half KM from the spot”.

The police station and hospital are

situated within a radius of 2 4/3 KM. In this regard,

os; Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All

(Cr. No. 236-M of 2017 Koshor Khan Vs. The State and another}
-7-
Shah Murad Khan (PW-8) has stated in his cross-

examination that:

“PS Samarbagh is situated at about % KM away
from the place of occurrence, and Hospital
Samarbagh is about 3 KM away from the place
of occurrence”.

At the relevant time, a portion of the
hospital was occupied by Pak Army and they had
also established a check-post on the road. The local
police were able to hear the firing. The occurrence
has taken place at 05:30 A.M. The police had
attracted to the spot at 6:00/6:30 A.M. The injured
Mst. Razia and Abdul Rashid as well as the
deceased minor Bilal were present in the hospital at
06:30 A.M whereas according to medical reports,
the dead bodies of all other deceased were present in
the hospital at 07:15 A.M. Murasila Ex.PA is stated
to have been recorded on the spot at 07:15 A.M. The
convict Kashar Khan had no direct motive with the
deceased family, however, there is a previous enmity
between the complainant and his uncle Kashar

Khan, the present appellant/convict.

9. Having discussed the place of
occurrence, we thus move on to the prosecution
case. It is the case of prosecution that S.H.O of the

police station (PW-16) had attracted to the spot after

receiving the information that a car taking the bride
was fired at by some persons as a result thereof the
persons boarded in the car were either killed or got
injured. When he reached at the spot, Anwar Khan
(PW-5) had reported the matter by stating that on the

fateful day he had the marriage ceremony. Naimat

Ullah (PW-6), who is brother-in-law of the

complainant and also his relative, was taking the
bride Mst. Kainat in his car who was accompanied
by Mst. Hussan Pari, Mst. Shabnam, minor Bilal son
of Naimat Ullah, Mst. Razia (APW-1) wife of
Naimat Ullah, Mst. Asia and Abdul Rashid (APW-
2). When they reached at the place of occurrence,
the present appellant/convict Kashar Khan son of
Purdil and the absconding accused Sher Zaman and

Amir Badshah sons of Kashar Khan were already

ambushed there who had started firing at them as a

result thereof Mst. Hussan Pari, Mst. Asia, Mst.
Kainat, Mst. Shabnam and minor Bilal had died by
sustaining firearm injuries whereas Mst. Razia
(APW-1) and Abdul Rashid (APW-2) had sustained
injuries on their bodies. The complainant has stated
that the occurrence was witnessed by him as well as
by Naimat Ullah and other injured persons. The

motive behind the occurrence is enmity between the

il. Amir Rehman S.I, who at the relevant
time was S.H.O of P.S Samarbagh, has appeared
before the Court as PW-16. In his statement he has
stated that when he heard about the occurrence, he
rushed to the spot and recorded report of the
complainant Anwar Khan in shape of Murasila. He
had prepared the injury sheets and inquest reports of
the injured and deceased. In cross-examination he
has confirmed that he had heard the firing at 05:30
A.M and reached the spot at about 06:00/06:30 A.M.
He also confirmed that the distance of the place of
occurrence from the police station is about 2/3 KM
whereas the distance between the spot and hospital
is 3/4 K.M. He had stayed on the spot for one and
half an hour and he alongwith the 1.O had reached

the spot by foot.

similarly the presence of the deceased at 07:15 A.M
and availability of the injured persons including the

{€r.4 No. 236-M of 2017 Kashar Khan Vs. The State and another)
TalamuyPs*

-12-

statements of the eye witnesses because it appears
that the considerable delay in lodging the report has
given an ample opportunity to the complainant, eye
witnesses as well as police for preliminary inquiry
regarding nomination of the accused. Admittedly,
the S.H.O (PW-16) had reached the spot at
06:00/06:30 hours but he has recorded the report at
07:15 hours. The question arises that why he had not
registered the report just on his arrival to the spot
and delayed the same till 07:15 hours. This situation
leads us to the conclusion that not only preliminary
inquiry was conducted for nomination of the accused
after deliberation and consultation but the said
aspect of the case also casts a doubt on presence of
the complainant at the place of occurrence. Wisdom
in this regard is drawn from “Jftikhar Hussain and
others Vs. The State” (2004 SCMR 1185) wherein
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan has observed

as following.

eens it is a case in which F.I.R. has been
registered after consultation and conducting
preliminary investigation. If both these
witnesses in fact had witnessed the incident,
there was no occasion to cause delay in
lodging of F.I.R. It is significant to note that
delay in lodging F.1.R. under section 154,
Cr.P.C. is condonable keeping in view the
facts and circumstances of each case
particularly in those cases where the accused

OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Syed Arshad All

Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wioer Ahmad
{Cr.A No. 236-M of 2017 Kashar Khan Vs. The State and another)
-13-

persons have not been nominated in the F.I.R.
and the names of the witnesses who have seen
the incident have also not been mentioned but
where the complainant is fully aware about
the culprits and the names of the witnesses are
also known to him then if delay in lodging
F.LR. is caused, it creates heavy duty upon the
prosecution to explain the same satisfactorily
otherwise the prosecution case would become
doubtful......”

13. . Anwar Khan (PW-S) is the complainant

in the present case. According to the evidence,
deceased Mst. Kainat, the bride, was the sister of
Naimat Ullah (PW-6) and as per custom in the
locality, the said Naimat Ullah had left alongwith the

bride and other inmates for taking her to the house

"of Anwar Khan. This Anwar Khan has stated that he

Tajamul/Ps*,

was informed by Naimat Ullah regarding the
departure of Baraat to the house of complainant in
his car and thus, the complainant all alone had come
to the place of occurrence to receive the bride at the
spot which is at a distance of 500/600 yards from his
house. According to him he has seen the occurrence
but he has not taken any step to arrange for shifting
the injured persons and dead bodies of the deceased
to hospital. He does not inform his own family to
come to the place of occurrence for shifting the
injured and deceased nor does he inform: the local

- 14 -
police about the occurrence despite the fact that the
police station is situated at a distance of only two
kilometers from the place of occurrence. The time of
repot ie 07:15 and the time of examination of the
deceased and injured i.e 06:30 and 07:15 suggest
that the complainant had not accompanied the
deceased and injured persons to the hospital. The
aforesaid conduct of the complainant does not
inspire confidence rather it is unusual which creates
doubt and dent in his version, therefore, we are
constrained to assume/draw adverse inference from
his aforesaid conduct. Regarding such unusual
conduct of the witness in the case of “Nasrullah

alias Nasro Vs. The State” (2017 SCMR 724), the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that:

“It has been found by us to be intriguing that
the above mentioned eye-witnesses had
claimed to have seen the occurrence wherein
Mst. Hameed Bibi had been critically injured
but surprisingly the said eye-witnesses had
never taken the injured victim to the hospital
for medical treatment and till the arrival of
the complainant at the house of occurrence
the dead body of Mst. Hameed Bibi was still
lying in that house and it was he who had
statedly taken the dead body to the hospital.
Such unusual conduct of the above mentioned
eye-witnesses surely raised an eye-brow”.

14. Another inconsistency in the present

case is that the complainant in his initial report had

OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Syed Arshad All

Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wiger Ahmad
{Cc.A No, 236-M of 2017 Kashar Khan Vs. The State and another)
TajamuyPs* |

.-15-
charged three accused i.e the present appellant/
convict Kashar Khan and his two sons. Later at the
time of preparation of the site plan he has made
addition of yet a fourth assailant/accused by
assigning him a specific place in the site plan.
Likewise, he has recorded his statement u/s 164,
Cr.P.C wherein he has charged the acquitted accused
for facilitating the present appellant. Such conduct
of the complainant regarding belated and
afterthought nomination of the accused also
manifests that he had not seen the occurrence and, if
so, he would have charged them in his initial report.
The version of complainant regarding his presence at
the spot at the time occurrence is negated by the
statement recorded by Abdul Rashid (APW-2).
According to this witness, no one was attracted to
the spot soon after the occurrence. After half an hour
of the occurrence, a few females of the locality and
three males had come there but they did not help the
deceased and injured rather kept standing near them
till arrival of Shahab-ud-Din (PW-3) in his car who
had shifted the injured and’ minor deceased to
hospital. This statement of APW-2 clearly shows
that the complainant was not present at the spot at
the time of occurrence otherwise he would have

OB: Hon'ble Mr. sustice Syed Arshad All

Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
{Cr.A No, 236-M of 2017 Kashar Khan Vs, The State ond onother)
-16-

rushed near the deceased and injured persons soon
after the occurrence. Even the learned trial Court has
not believed the statement of complainant Anwar
Khan because he has not established his presence at
the spot at the relevant time. Since, the complainant
has not established his presence on the spot besides,
there are material contradictions in the statements of
eye witnesses, therefore, many serious doubts arise
in the prosecution case the benefit of which must be
given to the appellant/convict. Guidance is sought
from the judgment of the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case titled “Uftikhar Hussain _and
others Vs. The State” (2004 SCMR 1185) wherein

the Hon’ble Court observed as following.

“It is to be noted that in his
cross-examination, defence successfully,
brought on record material contradictions
which have impaired the intrinsic value of his
evidence. We are conscious of the fact that
evidence of a chance witness cannot be
brushed aside merely for the reason that he
happened to be at the place of incident
incidentally but to accept evidence of such
witness his presence at the spot is deemed to
be necessary and prosecution is supposed to
bring on record convincing evidence to
establish the same”.

IS. According to the prosecution case, the
complainant, being nephew of the present appellant/

convict, had direct enmity with him but it is

Tajamul/Ps +|

OB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All

(Cr.A No, 236-M of 2017 Kashar Khan Vs. The State and another}
-17-

astonishing that prior to the occurrence the
appellant/convict has made no attempt at the life of
complainant Anwar Khan, despite the fact that one
day prior to the occurrence he had seen him in the
house of the acquitted accused; and had chosen to
attack the bride and her family against whom he had
no motive. In the circumstances mentioned by
complainant in his report when he was all alone
waiting near the spot for arrival of the baraat, he

could be an easy prey for the assailants for

satisfaction of their revenge but instead targeting

other persons, against whom the appellant had no
grudge or enmity, does not appeal to a prudent mind.
The learned trial court has probably for the aforesaid |

reasons has discredited his testimony.

16. By disbelieving the testimony of
complainant Anwar Khan (PW-5), the prosecution is
left with eye witness Naimat Ullah and the two
injured eye witnesses Mst. Razia Bibi and Abdul
Rashid whose statements were recorded during the
post-remand proceedings conducted pursuant to the
directions of this Court. So far the ocular account of
PW-6 Naimat Ullah is concerned, this witness is the
real brother of deceased Mst. Kainat, the bride, and

he was carrying her to the house of complainant

Anwar Khan as per custom of the area whereas his
wife and child were also travelling in the car

targeted by firing. Thus, his presence at the spot is

_ quite natural. The mere fact that he did not sustain

‘TajamuyPs* |

any injury from the firing despite the fact that all
other persons, who were seated in the vehicle, had
sustained serious injuries, is no ground to disbelieve
his testimony because he could remain unhurt in the
incident by a stroke of luck. However, the question
arises that why this person had not promptly lodged
the F.I.R when the police official had reached at the
spot at about 6/ 6;30 am, rather his conduct shows
that on each and every occasion he had re-affirmed
the statement of complainant PW-5 who had initially

charged only three persons in the F.I.R and this

witness has re-affirmed his statement. Later the

absconding co-accused Khan Badshah was charged
by complainant (Pw-5) and this witness Naimat
Ullah (PW-6) has re-affirmed the said narration.
Subsequently, when the complainant while
recording his statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C nominated
the acquitted co-accused for providing logistic
support to the appellant/convict, this witness has
once again supported the said accusation despite the
fact that he had not seen them providing shelter and .

food to the present appellant/convict. However, the
crucial aspect of the case is that the occurrence had
taken place at 05:30 A.M and the local police had
reached at the spot by 06:00/06:30 A.M but till that
time no report was registered though he was present
at the spot. According to Murasila, the report was
lodged at 07:15 A.M whereas at the same time all
the deceased were shifted and they were available in
the hospital which is situated at a distance of 3/4
K.M from the place of occurrence. This situation
suggests that the Murasila was not prepared at the
spot but was drafted in the hospital or police station
and till the scribing of Murasila this PW Naimat
Ullah did not know the names of assailants. Thus, it
would be very unsafe and imprudent to rely on the
statement of Naimat Ullah (PW-6) for maintaining
the punishment of the present appellant/convict. A
witness might be a natural witness to the occurrence,
however if he himself does not spontaneously charge ‘
any one for the offence and just toe the line of
another person whose presence is doubtful on the
place of occurrence, then relying on his testimony |
will be very dangerous for awarding capital
punishment, rather the safe course would be to give

the benefit of doubt to the accused.

17. Regarding the testimony of injured
witnesses Mst. Razia Bibi (APW-1) and Abdul
Rashid (APW-2), who were examined during the
post-trial proceedings, their statements not only
suffer from glaring contradictions, but they have
also followed the pursuit with the complainant. In
her cross-examination, Mst. Razia stated that some
of the accused were standing on the road in front of
the motorcar and they started firing from the front
side and when the motorcar crossed them the other
accused started firing from the right side whereas
PW Abdul Rashid has insisted by stating that the
accused had fired at them only from the right side
and no firing was made from the front side. The
position of assailants was an important event of the
occurrence, therefore, contradictions inter se the
statements of the injured eye witnesses in this regard
cannot be brushed aside. No doubt, they have stamps
of injuries on their persons but the mere fact that —
they had sustained injuries is not a sufficient proof
that they had told the whole truth. In this regard we
would refer the judgment of the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case “Said Ahmad Vs.
Zammured Hussaina and_4 others” (1981 SCMR

795) wherein it was observed that:

\t is correct that the two eye-witnesses are
injured and the injuries on their persons do
indicate that they were not self-suffered. But
that by itself would not show that they had, in
view of the aforenoted circumstances, told the
truth in the Court about the occurrence.
18. Mode and manner of the occurrence is
also a relevant factor in the present case which needs
some discussion. It is a prevalent custom in the area
that on the occasions of marriages, normally male
and female relatives including the children of the
bridegroom go to the house of bride as bridal
procession ('L4) for bringing her to the house of
bridegroom alongwith the dowry, if any. But it is
strange enough that no person from the house of the
bridegroom had participated the baraat and only the
relatives of the bride were accompanying her. The
injured witnesses APW-1 and APW-2 have also
admitted in their cross-examination that dowry of
the bride in shape of 10/12 suitcases containing
dresses and other articles arranged for her had been
placed in trunk of the same vehicle and the suitcases
were also hit by bullets but police have not taken
into possession any of the dowry articles which were
being carried with bride to the house of complainant.

Abdul Rashid (APW-2) has also narrated in his

cross-examination that after the occurrence he and

PW Naimat Ullah had de-boarded from the vehicle
and had waited there for one hour till the arrival of
Shahab-ud-Din (PW-3). During this period the said
injured witness had only made a phone call through
his cell phone to his relative in Sakhakot but did not
inform the local police or his other local relatives or
his family members to help them in shifting the
injured and deceased to hospital. A person capable
of making a phone call in injured condition
accompanied by an unhurt person namely Naimt
Ullah (PW-6) is not expected to de-board from the
vehicle leaving five injured females and a child,
their nears and dears, in pathetic condition inside the
car without making any effort for their help and
were waiting for one hour of the arrival of PW
Shahab-ud-Din, whereas the place of their
destination is just 500/600 yards away. Thus,
keeping in view the manner of taking the bride to the
house of the bridegroom that too early in the
morning coupled with the unusual conduct of the —
injured witnesses Abdul Rashid (APW-2) and
Naimat Ullah (PW-6), it appears that the occurrence .
has not taken place in the mode and manner as
mentioned in the F.LR. The august Supreme Court

of Pakistan while deciding the case of “Mst. Shamim

and 2 others Vs. The State and another” (2003

SCMR 1466) had disbelieved the prosecution
version in view of the given surrounding

circumstances by observing that:

“The prosecution story being the foundation
on which edifice of the prosecution case is
raised occupies a pivotal position in a criminal
case. It should, therefore, stand to reason and
must be natural, convincing and free from any
inherent improbability. It is neither safe to
believe a prosecution story which does not
meet these requirements nor a prosecution
case based on an improbable prosecution
story can sustain conviction”.

19. Moving on to the recovery of crime
weapon. Admittedly, the present appellant was
arrested by Pak Army and he was handed over to
local police alongwith Kalashnikov No. 1975-kx-
7230 with 68 rounds of 7.62 bore. In this regard
recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1 was prepared which was
attested by constable Abdul Qayum No. 1448 (PW- |
2) and Constable Naveed Alam (not produced) but
the. Army personnel who had handed over the
weapon to police was neither shown as marginal
witness of the recovery memo nor he was produced
before he trial Court to substantiate the said
recovery. Although constable Abdul Qayum (PW-2)

has stated in his examination-in-chief that the -

weapon was recovered from possession of the
present appellant/convict but he has categorically
admitted in his cross-examination that the weapon
was not recovered from possession of the accused
rather it was handed over by army personnel to
police. The police have also failed to associate any
independent witness with the said recovery. In such
circumstances, the positive F.S.L report (Ex.PW-
1/5) to the extent of 11 out of 22 crime empties
recovered from the spot and the alleged crime
weapon is of no help to prosecution most
particularly when the prosecution has failed to
establish the guilt of the present appellant/convict
through ocular account and other circumstantial

evidence.

20. In view of what has been discussed
above, the prosecution has failed to prove its case
against the present appellant/convict beyond shadow
of doubt, hence, his conviction and sentence
recorded by learned trial Court in the impugned
judgment are not sustainable. Therefore, this appeal
is allowed, the impugned judgment dated 02.11.2017
of the learned trial Court is set aside and
appellant/convict Kashar Khan son of Purdil Khan is

acquitted of the charge leveled against him. Murder
