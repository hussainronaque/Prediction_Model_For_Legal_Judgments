2018 filed by complainant side for enhancement of
sentence of the appellants, as both these cases are
emanating from the same judgment dated
07.11.2018 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Dir Upper, in case F.I1.R
No. 147 dated 15.06.2016 u/s 302/109/34 P.P.C
registered at Police Station Kalkot, District Dir
Upper, whereby the appellants were convicted u/s
302 (b) P.P.C and sentenced to life imprisonment
with fine of Rs.100,000/- each or to undergo further
six months S.I each in case of default in payment of
fine. They were also burdened to pay Rs.100,000/-
each as compensation to LRs of each of the
deceased, or in case of default they were directed to
undergo further six months S.I each. Benefit of

section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended to them.

2. Abstract of the prosecution case is that
on receiving information regarding murders,
Muhammad Siyar Khan (PW-2), SHO of P.S Kalkot,
rushed to village Reman Kass, Kalkot and came to
know that two women had been shot dead.
Complainant Lal Zada (PW-7), who was present
there, reported the occurrence to police by narrating
that on 15.06.2016 at morning time his mother Mst.
Saleh Marjana and sister-in-law Mst. Shamshad ;

<3ie
Begum wife of Gul Bahadar were busy in hoeing the
maize crop in their fields known as Shatop. The
sheep and goats of Rehmat Ali etc entered the maize
crop; the ladies drove the goats out of the field and
cautioned the owners thereof for keeping the goats
under control on which the present appellants started
altercation and thereafter all the three appellants
fired at the ladies at 08:30 hours. Resultantly, Mst.
Saleh Marjana sustained injury on her chest whereas
Mst. Shamshad Begum was wounded on the elbow
of her right hand and left side of her back and both
died on the spot. The complainant also charged co-
accused Karim and Badshah Gul for instigation of
the appellants for committing the murders.
Altercation between the deceased and appellants
over entry of sheep and goats to the fields was
mentioned as motive behind the occurrence and the
occurrence was stated to have been witnessed by
Imran Khan (PW-8) and Masta Khan (not produced)

and Abdur Rehman (PW-9).

3. After recording report of the
complainant through Murasila Ex.PW-2/1, the
S.H.O (PW-2) prepared injury sheets and inquest
reports of the deceased ladies and sent the dead

bodies to Sharingal hospital for medical

4. Initially all the accused remained
absconders. The acquitted co-accused were arrested
on 20.07.2016 and supplementary challan against
them was submitted before the trial Court. The
present appellants were arrested on 21.09.2016 and
after submission of supplementary challan, all the
accused were formally indicted by trial Court for the
offence to which they did not plead guilty and opted
to face the trial. Prosecution produced ten PWs in
support of its case against the accused and closed its
evidence. It is noteworthy that learned DPP had
moved an application on 23.07.2016 for discharge of
co-accused Karim and Badshah Gul. The learned
trial Court, after hearing the arguments, accepted the
said application vide order dated 24.10.2017,
resultantly, the said co-accused were acquitted of the

charge.

After closure of the prosecution
evidence, the appellants were examined u/s 342,
Cr.P.C during which they denied the allegations of
prosecution by professing innocence, however, they

neither recorded their own statements on oath nor

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiaar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

-6-

produced any witness in their defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide
judgment dated 07.11.2018 convicted the appellants
u/s 302(b) P.P.C for murders of the ladies and
sentenced them in the manner already discussed in

the earlier part of this judgment. Hence, this appeal.

5. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned counsel

representing the State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

6. Prosecution has examined complainant
Lal Zada (PW-7), Imran Khan (PW-8) and Abdur
Rehman (PW-9) as eye witnesses of the occurrence.
According to complainant Lal Zada, he was present
at the rooftop of his house at the time of occurrence
and witnessed the present appellants firing at both
the deceased, however, the same was not his version
in the initial report because he did not mention his
name as eye witness of the occurrence. This fact was
also admitted by author of Murasila (PW-2) and I.O
(PW-10) in their respective cross-examination. Thus,
the complainant has tried to improve his initial
version by introducing himself as eye witness of the

occurrence at a belated stage, as such, he is not a

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
“Tn

trustworthy witness. Reliance is placed on Akhtar
Ali_Vs. The State (2008 SCMR_ 6). The august
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed in this regard

that:

It is also a settled maxim when a witness
improves his version to strengthen the
prosecution case, his improved statement
subsequently made cannot be relied upon as
the witness has improved his statement
dishonestly, therefore, his credibility
becomes doubtful on the well known
principle of criminal jurisprudence that
improvements once found deliberate and
dishonest cast serious doubt on the veracity
of such witness.

The complainant has also admitted in
his cross-examination that women folk of the area
including the ladies of his house observe parda. It is
astonishing that parda nasheen ladies of his house
were busy in hoeing the maize crop in the fields and
he was sitting on the rooftop of his house and did not
participate with the deceased ladies in the said work
which is commonly the job of males in this area. It is
also strange enough that women of his house were
involved in altercation with the appellants
whereafter the occurrence took place which
culminated in double murders but the complainant
remained silent spectator; neither he defended his
nears and dears nor took any step in retaliation

_against the appellants. The complainant did not _

exhibit the natural conduct usually displayed by
people in such like shocking situation. In view of the
mentioned facts and circumstances of the case,
presence of the complainant near the place of
occurrence is doubtful, therefore, his statement is not

worth reliance.

7. The other eye witnesses namely Imran
Khan and Abdur Rehman appeared before the trial
Court as PW-8 and PW-9 respectively. The former is
brother-in-law whereas the latter is cousin of the
complainant. No doubt, discarding ocular account of
related or interested witnesses in each and every
case is not a rule, however, on close perusal of the
statements recorded by the mentioned PWs in the
present case, their presence on the spot is also not
free from doubt. They have been shown at Points
No. 7 & 9 in the site plan Ex.PW-10/1 which is the
boundary line (known as pula in the local dialect)
between the two fields. In response to a question by
the defence counsel, the Investigating Officer
(PW-10) admitted in his cross-examination that:

The assertion of PW Imran Khan that he
was present on the spot because he was going to the
house of complainant, does not appeal to prudent
mind in view of the above admission of the I.O.
Similar is the position of PW Abdur Rehman who,
according to his own statement, is resident of village
Kalkot situated at a walking distance of 20 minutes
from village Reman Kass where the occurrence took
place. This witness has also not given a plausible
reason for his presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence except the narration in his cross-
examination that he was present in his filed adjacent
to the field where the occurrence took place but his
this version does not get support from the site plan
wherein no land of the said PW adjacent to the spot
has been shown. Assemblage of the above said two
eye witnesses and PW Masta Khan (shown at Point-
8 but not produced) at the same time on the spot at
the time of occurrence is otherwise also doubtful
because the said place is neither a general pathway
for common people nor is a public place visited by
them as usual. The eye witnesses, though related to
deceased, have also not accompanied the dead
bodies to hospital. Thus, in view of the above

mentioned aspects of the case, they were mere

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-
chance witnesses, hence, their presence on the spot
at the relevant time is doubtful. In almost similar

situation in the case of GM Niaz Vs. The State

reported as 2018 SCMR_ 506, the august Supreme

Court of Pakistan disbelieved the ocular account by

observing that:

The ocular account of the incident in issue
had been furnished before the trial court by
Mahboob Ahmed complainant (PW6) and
Qasim Ali (PW5) who were a brother and a
paternal cousin of the deceased respectively.
The said eye-witnesses were not only very
closely related to the deceased but they were
also chance witnesses who had utterly failed
to bring anything on the record establishing
their claimed presence with the deceased at
the relevant time. Mahboob Ahmed
complainant (PW6) had his residence far
away from the spot and the same had not
even been shown anywhere close to the place
of occurrence in the site-plan. Qasim Ali
(PWS) had his residence about ten kilometers
away from the scene of the crime. He had
maintained that he was present at the spot in

order to see a movie but the said reason had
not been established before the trial court
through any independent evidence. The
record of the case shows that Zahid Iqbal
deceased was taken to the hospital in an
injured condition by a police constable and
not by the above mentioned closely related
eye-witnesses and this fact completely belied
the claim of the eyewitnesses regarding their
presence with the deceased at the relevant
time.

8. The PWs have admitted in their cross-
examination that there were several houses near the

place of occurrence and the people had attracted to

Tajamul/PS* |

2 (EE =
the spot on hearing firing shots but no independent
witness of the houses surrounding the place of
occurrence was produced in support of the allegation
against the present appellants. Even PW Masta
Khan, who was an impartial eye witness of the
occurrence per prosecution version and was assigned
Point No.8 in the site plan, was abandoned. This
situation leads us to draw an adverse inference under
Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 that had the prosecution produced the said
witness at trial stage he would not have supported

the prosecution case.

Another aspect of the case is that
according to site plan, there are rivulet/water
channel and pathway on the northern side of the
field where the occurrence took place and further in
north side of the said channel there is field of one
Wali Khan in which the maize crop was grown. The
houses of appellants are situated in the north side of
the said field. Movement of the sheep and goats of
the appellants from their house and reaching to the
field of complainant, avoiding the intervening maize
field of Wali Khan for grazing and thereafter
crossing the water channel and path, appears to bea

concocted story.

It is also noteworthy that the occurrence
was reported at 09:30 A.M with apparent delay of
one hour though the police station is at a distance of
1 % K.M from the spot. On the other side, the
deceased were brought to hospital at 01:00 P.M i.e
after 3 % hours of lodging the report. If the
maximum time of one hour consumed on recording
the report and other documents is excluded, even
then the prosecution has not explained that for what
purpose the dead bodies were kept in the house for
2 % hours and not shifted to hospital soon after the
report. The mentioned difference regarding the time
of report and examination of the dead bodies by
doctor indicates that the time of report mentioned in
Murasila/F .I.R is fictitious and the actual time of
report was suppressed by police at the time of

recording the report.

Similarly, it cannot be expected from an
ordinary person to commit two murders only on the
ground that he was cautioned not to let his goats to
spoil the growing crop. It appears that the
occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged by prosecution rather something,
other than what was narrated in the report, had
happened prior to the occurrence between the parties

DB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/PS*|

a13e
which was not brought on the record and real facts

of the occurrence were suppressed.

PW Imran Khan also admitted in his
cross-examination that there was a dispute between
father of complainant and father of PW Sher
Bahadar regarding title of the field where the
occurrence took place and at that time the said land
was barren/uncultivated. Though afterwards the
witness has corrected this slip of his tongue to justify
presence of the deceased on the spot by stating that
the subject field was not disputed and maize crop
was grown on it, however, the former spontaneous
utterance of the PW creates a doubt regarding the
fact that maize crop was grown in the said field and
the deceased were present there for weeding the
crop. Although the I.O has placed on file some
photographs showing maize crop and blood but the
said photographs by itself cannot establish the fact
that the occurrence had taken place in the same field
which was shown in the site plan. Thus, the entire
prosecution case rests on a very flimsy foundation
which does not stand to reason. Reliance is placed

on “Mst. Shamim_and_2 others Vs. The State and

another” (2003 SCMR 1466) wherein it was held

that:
DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*

-14-

“The prosecution story being the foundation
on which edifice of the prosecution case is
raised occupies a pivotal position in a criminal
case. It should, therefore, stand to reason and
must be natural, convincing and free from any
inherent improbability. It is neither safe to
believe a prosecution story which does not
meet these requirements nor a prosecution
case based on an improbable prosecution
story can sustain conviction”.

9. Coming to circumstantial evidence on
the record, according to medical evidence, both the
deceased have sustained entry wounds almost of the
same dimension whereas only two crime empties
have been recovered from point “C” as shown in the
site plan but on the other hand three persons have
been charged allegedly armed with formidable
weapons Kalashnikov. The above stated position of
medical evidence and recovery of empties from a
single point suggests the involvement of a single
accused in the occurrence, thus, the charge appears
to be exaggerated by throwing a wide net to
implicate three real brothers. Guidance in this regard
is sought from the judgment in the case titled
“Farman _Ali_and 03 others Vs. The State” (PLD
1980 Supreme Court 201) wherein it has been

observed by the Hon’ble apex Court that:

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
215s

"In his dying declaration, Rashid Khan has
involved the three brothers as well as their
friend, Farman Ali. But the medical evidence
and the evidence of the Ballistic Expert do
seem to cast doubt on his veracity. The
evidence of Doctor Muhammad Kamal, who
had conducted autopsy on the dead body of
Rashid Khan! is that the size of inlet of all the
wounds suffered by him was the same
meaning thereby that he had been shot from
one or more than one weapon of the same
calibre. It is in the evidence of the Ballistic
Expert, however, that the four empties sent
to him for examination were found to have
been fired through .32 bore pistol which was
also sent to him by the Investigation Officer.
It would therefore follow that Rashid Khan
had been shot through a pistol and certainly
not through a rifle with which Farman Ali is
said to have been armed. It is true that
according to the prosecution each one of the
| three appellant brothers was armed with a
| .32 bore pistol. But the type of injuries
| suffered by Rashid Khan rather suggest that
it was the work of one man. It is common
knowledge that .32 bore pistol is an
automatic weapon carrying in its charger
seven bullets. The fact that the deceased was
found to have suffered seven inlet wounds,
three of them in his left Knee joint, one on his
left elbow, two in his abdomen and one in
backward direction to his right superior iliac
spine, the inlet -size of all of which is said to
be the same, would go a long way to show
that this could as well be the work of a single
person and not of the three appellants. There
is no evidence on the record to show,
however, as to which one of the three had
caused him the said injuries, therefore, no
option is left but to hold that the prosecution
has failed to bring home its case against any
one of the appellants".

No doubt, it is the allegation against the

appellants that they had acted in prosecution of their

Tajamul/PS*| DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/PS*

=16<

common intention, however, it is the case of
prosecution that the occurrence had taken place over
trespassing of the appellants’ goats into the maize
crop of the complainant. Apparently, the occurrence
has taken place at spur of the moment and there is no
past blood feud between the parties to suggest that
the appellants had attacked the ladies after pre-
planning, therefore, the provision under section 34
P.P.C is not attracted to the case in the mentioned

circumstances.

10. To review the entire evidence brought
on the record, the prosecution case is full of various
inconsistencies of glaring nature which are sufficient
to create several reasonable doubts in prudent mind
qua the guilt of the appellants. It is well settled that
benefit of even a single but reasonable doubt should
be extended to an accused not as a matter of grace

but as matter of right. Reliance is placed on Tarig

Pervez Vs. The State (1995 SCMR 1345). The rule

laid down by the august Supreme Court in the said

judgment is as follows.

The concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For
giving him benefit of doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt

DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
=I7=
in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused will be entitled to
the benefit not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right.
Ii. For what has been discussed above, by
allowing this appeal, we set aside conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellants by learned trial
Court through judgment dated 07.11.2018 and acquit
them in case F.LR No. 147 dated 15.06.2016
registered against them u/s 302, 109, 34 P.P.C at
Police Station Kalkot, District Dir Upper. They be
released forthwith from jail if not required in any
other case. The connected Cr.R No. 108-M/ 2018,

for having become infructuous in view of acquittal

of the appellants, is accordingly dismissed.

12. Above are the reasons of our short

order of the even date.
