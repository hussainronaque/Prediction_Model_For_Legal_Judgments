KRERK

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- The appellants Nasir,
Haneef, and Abid through the instant criminal appeal have
assailed judgment dated 23.06.202:, passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III / Model Criminal Trial Court,
District Swabi in case FIR No.256 dated 24.03.2019 under
sections 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station Kalu Khan,
District Swabi, whereby, they were convicted and
sentenced as under:

i. Under section 302(b)/34 PPC, to imprisonment
for life as Tazir with fine of Rs.8,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of each
deceased within the meaning of section 544-A
Cr.PC or in default whereof to undergo six
months S.I. each; and

ii. Under section 324/34 PPC, to one year R.I.

with fine of Rs.20,000/- cr in default thereof, to
suffer two months S.I: cach. Benefit under
-2-

section 382-B Cr.P.C P.P.C was also extended

to the appellants and the sentences were

ordered to run concurrently.
2. The transient facts as unfolded in the first
information report are that Bismillah Jan S.I. on receiving
information regarding the occurrence rushed to the casualty
of Civil Hospital Kalu Khan on 24.03.2019 at 09:15 hours,
where complainant Mudasir Shah brought the dead bodies
of his brother namely Islam Shah and his uncle namely
Shah Said and lodged a report ta the effect that on the
fateful day, he alongwith his brother Islam Shah, uncles
Shah Said and Syed Anwar Shah left their village Ismaila
for Mohallah Khawar Ghadi; on reaching near Masjid
Mustafa, Khawar Ghadi, at about 08:30 AM, their co-
villagers, namely, Nasir, Haneef, and Abid (present
appellants) appeared duly armed with firearms and started
firing, through their respective weapons, at them in order to
commit their Qatl-i-Amd, due to which, his brother Islam
Shah and uncle Shah Said got hit and died on the spot,
while he alongwith uncle Syed Anwar Shah escaped unhurt;
that besides him, the occurrence was witnessed by Syed
Anwar Shah. Motive behind the occurrence is alleged that a
day earlier to the occurrence, the present appellants had
beaten his uncles Said Anwar Shah and Muhammad Qader.
The report of the complainant reduced in shape of Murasila

Ex.PA/1 which was sent to the PS for registration of the
an

-3-
case, on the basis of which, the instant case FIR was
registered against the appellants.
3. Oncompletion of investigation and arrest of accused
/ appellants, complete challan was submitted against them,
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution
produced and examined as many as 12 witnesses. On close
of prosecution evidence, statements of appellants were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither they
opted to be examined on oath as provided under section
340(2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produce defence evidence.
After hearing arguments, the learned trial Court vide the
impugned judgment, convicted and sentenced the appellants
as mentioned above. Hence, the instant criminal appeal
against the judgment of conviction. .
4. Arguments heard and record scanned through.
5. The tragic incident led to the death of two innocent
souls, whose dead bodies were shifted from the spot to
Civil Hospital Kalu Khan, where the matter was reported.
The injury sheets and inquest reports were prepared and the
report was penned down in the shape of Murasila. After
doing the needful, the dead bodies were sent to the doctor
for postmortem examination. The investigating officer after
receiving copy of the FIR, visited the spot and on pointation

of the eye witnesses, prepared the site plan. During spot
-4-

inspection, the investigating officer collected blood through
cotton from respective places of the deceased and also took
into possession two empties of 9mm bore, three empties of
.30 bore and six empties of 7.62 bore, from the place of
incident. The collected empties were sent to the firearms
expert to ascertain as to whether the same were fired from
one or different weapons. The firearms expert after putting
the empties to the test of chemical examination, opined that
the two empties of 9mm bore were fired from different
weapons, three empties of .30 bore were also fired from
different weapons and in respect of six empties of 7.62
bore, the opinion was also received to have been fired from
different weapons. It is pertinent to mention that soon after
the occurrence, two of the appellants i.e. Hanif and Abid
volunteered their arrest on 02.94.2019, whereas, the
appellant Nasir was arrested after an alleged encounter
between him and the police officials in which respect case
FIR No.409 dated 18.05.2019 with Police Station Kalu
Khan was registered. The appellant:was disarmed and from
his personal possession, the Kalashnikov alongwith two
chargers and a bandolier were recovered. The appellants
faced trial and on conclusion of the trial, they were
convicted and sentenced as stated above. Feeling
disgruntled, the appellants approached this Court through

the instant criminal appeal.
-5-  &

6. The record was scanned through with valuable
assistance of learned counsel for the appellants, the learned
Additional Advocate General assisted by learned counsel
for the complainant, to know as to whether the learned trial
Court was justified in handing* down the impugned
judgment and as to whether the learned trial Court could
appreciate the available record, more particularly, the
recorded statements of the witnesses. True that on one
hand, two persons lost their lives, but equally true that on
the other, three accused are charg2d for the death of the
deceased, so this Court is to see as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellants, that too, through trustworthy and confidence
inspiring evidence, as this Court is, under the obligation to
re-assess and to re-appreciate the already assessed evidence,
so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided.

7. The points for determination before this Court are, as
to whether the witnesses were present on the spot at the
time of incident and in the hospital, alongwith the dead
bodies, when the matter was repo:ted; as to whether the
incident occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated
time; as to whether the motive brought on record has been
established through confidence inspiring and trustworthy
evidence and as to whether the prosecution could succeed

in bringing home guilt against the appellants.
-6- +

8. The incident occurred in a thoroughfare leading from
village Ismaila to village Khawar Ghadi and it is also
evident from the site plan that the house of the appellants
falls in the way while proceeding from village Ismaila to
village Khawar Ghadi. The site plen depicts that when the
complainant party reached to the place of incident, the
appellants also attracted to. the spot and started
indiscriminate firing, which led to the death of the
deceased. This is interesting to note that early in the
morning, the deceased, the complaiant, and the eyewitness
planned to visit the house of one Faheem Akbar to purchase
a cow and per statements of the witnesses, they reached to
his house at 07:45 hours where they spent some 20 minutes
in negotiation, but they could not succeed in purchasing the
cow, so they left back for their Aouses. This is for the
prosecution to tell that when apart from the complainant,
the eye witness and the deceased, no other person had
participated in planning a visit to the house of the cow
dealer, then how the accused / appellants came to know that
the deceased and complainant would come to the spot at the
stated time. The site plan further depicts that the house of
the accused is situated at a considerable distance from the
place where the incident occurred, then it is for the
prosecution to answer that how and why the accused /

appellants came towards the place cf incident by covering a
-7-

considerable distance, as the complainant party was to pass
through their house and in that eventuality, the accused /
appellants would have easily executed the plan. This
troubles again the judicial mind of this Court that when the
complainant side noticed the coming of the accused /
appellants towards them, that too, .duly armed, then what
precluded them from taking shelter or to rescue themselves
from the wrath of the accused / appellants, despite the fact
that few days earlier, the parties had scuffled with each
other, in which respect, Naqal Mad No.9 dated 23.03.2019
with Police Post Itham was incorporated, where the
complainant Muhammad Qader and PW Anwar Shah had
allegedly received injuries at the hands of the accused /
appellant Nasir Khan. The said episode has been termed to
be the basis of the present incident. We are yet to know that
when in the earlier episode, one Mvhammad Mugaddar and
PW Anwar Shah got injured, that t00, at the hands of the
accused / appellant Nasir Khan, then what led the accused /
appellants to kill the deceased, as in the previous episode, it
was the complainant party, who suffered, and it was the
complainant party to retaliate, to ba!ance the sides. Another
interesting aspect of the case is, that none of the deceased
was a party to the previous episode and even, the
complainant of the present case does not find mention in the

very report. This is for the prosecution to tell that when in
-8-

the previous round, only Muhammad Qader and PW Syed
Anwar Shah were the parties, then why PW Anwar Shah
was not targeted, as he was the pri‘ne target. This is yet to
be answered that when accused / appellant Nasir was the
only person, who got engaged with the complainant side
earlier, then what led the remaining appellants to join hands
with him. We are yet to test the veracity of Naqal Mad No.9
dated 23.03.2019 as to whether the same was incorporated
on 23.03.2019 or that it was fabricated with the sole
purpose to strengthen the prosecution case. This is
astonishing that complainant of the daily diary No.9 and
PW Syed Anwar Shah received injuries at the hands of the
accused / appellant Nasir, on 20.(3.2019, but the matter
was not reported on the very day, rather the report was
made on 23.03.2019, when allegedly, the accused /
appellant extended threats of dire consequences to them. If
the complainant was desirous to report the matter regarding
physical assault on him, then he would have reported the
matter on 20.03.2019 and. not on 23.03.2019 and in that
eventuality, both the witnesses would have opted for their
medical examination, but on one hand, the matter was
delayed till 23.03.2019 and on the other, the injured did not
opt to be examined by a doctor 1egarding the nature of
injuries caused. The conduct displayed by the witnesses /

injured of Naqal Mad No.9 has twisted the prosecution case
-9-

toa greater extent and we cannot restrain ourselves from
declaring the same as a suspect document, which cannot be
pressed into service to favour the prosecution.

9. The complainant and the eye! witness were examined
as PW-07 and PW-08. The complainant when appeared
before the trial court, disclosed the events in the following
manner; that on the day of incident, he alongwith the
deceased and the eye witness left their houses for village
Khawar Ghadi to purchase a cow from one Faheem Akbar;
that when they reached near Masjid Mustafa, the accused /
appellants arrived duly armed and started firing at them,
which resulted in death of the deceased; that soon after the
incident, the dead bodies were shifted to the hospital and
the matter was reported. In his examination in chief, he
could not explain that what weapons the accused /
appellants were having in possession and even, while
reporting the matter, despite the fact that he claimed
acquaintance with different types, of weapons. He was
thoroughly cross examined on material aspects of the case,
where he disclosed that on the day of incident, he got up
early in the morning, performed his Fajar prayer and
thereafter, took his breakfast. He confirmed that though, he
owns a grocery shop in village Khawar Ghadi, but on the
day of incident, he did not opt to go there, rather he

alongwith the deceased and the eye witness planned to
CO =)

-10-

purchase a cow from one Faheem Akbar and that for that
purpose, all the four left their houses, and the unfortunate
incident occurred. This is astonishing that four persons
grouped together to purchase a cow and for the very
purpose, they visited the house of the cow dealer, but
neither the statement of the cow dealer was recorded nor
any independent witness was produced in that respect. As
the very purpose of their presence on the place of incident
was their coming back from the house of the cow dealer,
then this aspect of the case was of inuch importance for the
prosecution to prove, but both the complainant and the
investigating officer overlooked this material aspect of the
case, which is a determining factor to establish the presence
of all the four at the place of incidert. When the prosecution
failed to prove its purpose, then this court lurks no doubt in
mind that the presence of the complainant and eye witness
is not established from the record.

10. The site plan depicts the respective places of the
assailants and the complainant party and also, the inter se
distances between the accused / appellants and the
deceased. The record tells that the accused / appellants, at
the time of incident, were present at a distance of 24 feet
from the complainant party and the complainant and the eye
witness were at a distance of less than 05 feet from the

deceased. This is for the prosecution to tell that when the
 -1l- (
assailants were present at a shorter distance, duly armed
with sophisticated weapons, what precluded them to kill the
complainant and the eye. witness as well, despite the fact
that the eye witness Syed Anwar Shah was the prime target.
Both the witnesses i.e. the complainant and the eye witness
admitted that the accused / appellants fired at them 10 / 15
fire shots respectively, but they escaped unhurt. When the
accused / appellants had the intention to kill the
complainant and the eye witness as well, and when 30 fire
shots in all were made on them, then how the witnesses
escaped unhurt despite the fact that there was no shelter
available to them and even, they did not opt to take shelter.
The site plan further tells and so admitted by the
investigating officer, that the complainant and the eye
witness, at the time of incident, were present at point No.3
& 4, well within the firing range of the accused / appellants,
but even then, they did not receive a single firearm injury.
The manner in which the fire was made and the distance
between the assailants and the complainant party has
created dents in the prosecution case. The presence of the
eye witnesses has further been belied by the fact that both
of the witnesses stated that all the accused fired a single fire
shot over the deceased Islam Shah, but astonishingly, a
single firearm injury was found on the body of the

deceased, but none of the witness could tell with accuracy
-12-

that whose fire shot proved effective. The record further
tells that both the deceased received a single firearm injury
on their bodies, one on his forehead, whereas, the other, on
the lateral aspect of his thigh. Had all the three accused,
duly armed with weapons, fired at the complainant party,
then the deceased would have received multiple firearm
injuries, but the case is otherwise. The attending

circumstances of the present case help us in forming an

opinion that the incident did not occur in the mode and in

the manner. In case titled “Rafaat Shah Vs The State”
(2022 PCr.LJ Note 39 Balochistan; it was held that:

“The mode and manner of the
occurrence itself by the prosecution
is not appealable to the prudent
mind, therefore, it was highly unsafe
to rely on the statemert of both these
witnesses to maintain conviction and
sentence of the accused on a capital
charge.”
11. The presence of the complainant and the eye witness
is a circumstance which does not f'nd support from record
of the case, as in case of indiscriminate firing, there was no
occasion for the witnesses to survive and there was no
hurdle in the way of the appellants to eliminate the

complainant side. The complainant during cross

i
-13-

examination disclosed that it was He who shifted the dead
bodies to the cot and his hands were besmeared with blood,
but the investigating officer did not mention the same,
which further creates doubt in respect of the presence of the
complainant at the time of incident and the shifting of dead
bodies to the cot. We are yet to know that out of the
deceased, one received firearm injury on the lateral aspect
of his thigh and he lost his life because of excessive
bleeding. When the witnesses were available on the spot
and the hospital was lying in the close proximity, what
stopped them from rushing the deceased to the hospital to
save his life. This particular circumstance is a factor which
cannot be left unnoticed, rather it tells regarding the
unnatural conduct displayed by the witnesses and at the
same time is another determining factor regarding the
presence of witnesses on the spot at the time of incident.
The presence of the eye-witness is shrouded in mystery, as
despite his presence in the hospital, he did not verify the
report of the complainant, rather a person, who was neither
the eye-witness of the incident nor present on the spot,
verified the report and the conduc: displayed by the eye-
witness is not only unnatural, but also makes his presence
doubtful. This is interesting to note that neither the
complainant nor the eye-witness identified the dead-bodies

before the police at the time of report and before the doctor
-14-

at the time of postmortem examination, rather two other
witnesses belonging to different places opted to identify the
dead-bodies. The absence of the complainant and the eye-
witness in the columns of identification both in the inquest
and the postmortem reports is a circumstance that has
damaged the prosecution case beyond repair.

12. The medical evidence is in, conflict with the eye-
witness account, as on one hand: the deceased received
single firearm injury with the dimension of .5x.5 cm, with
its exit as 1x1 cm each, which suggests that the same was
the doing of one person, that too, with one weapon. The
seat of injury on one of the deceased is on lateral aspect of
the thigh which further contradicts the stance of the
witnesses, as the witnesses disclosed that they were
proceeding towards north, when the accused / appellants
attracted to the spot from the northern side and started firing
at them, then in that eventuality, the deceased would have
received an entry wound on the front of his thigh, which
further belied the stance of the witnesses. True that medical
evidence is confirmatory in nature and in case of
confidence inspiring eye-witness account, the same plays a
little role to upset the prosecution case, but equally true that
when the prosecution case is suffering from inherent
defects, then in that eventuality, the medical evidence gains

much importance, which, under no circumstances, can be
-15-

ignored. The dimensions of injuries and the number of
accused charged has put a question mark over the
integrity/veracity of the witnesses and this particular aspect
of the case creeps down to the root. Furthermore, the net
has been thrown wide and all the active male members of
the family have been enroped, that too, for two injuries
caused having the same dimension. Wisdom could also be
derived from the judgment of this Court reported as 2014
MLD _446_ Peshawar “Amir Vs The State” where the
factum of commission of offence being an act not
commensurating with the number of accused charged was
considered against the prosecution. There is no denial of the
fact that when Court comes to a conclusion that the number
of accused has been exaggerated, then extra care and
caution is required to be taken while appraising the
evidence. In this respect, wisdom can be derived from the
judgment rendered by the Apex Court in case titled
“Muhammad Zaman Vs The State _and others” (2014
SCMR 749) wherein it was held that:

“The number of assailants in the
circumstances of the case appears to
have been exaggerated. It seems that
most of the persons including the
respondents have been charged

because of previous enmity. The

tragedy may have been enacted by
-16-

Mukhtar who has gone into hiding
or Munawar who has been acquitted
because the deceased Shabbir was
alleged to have illicit relations with
their sister, but many who have no
visible nexus with this part of the
story have also been roped in. It is so
because it is customary in this part of
the country to throw wide the net of
implication to rope in all those who
could possibly pursue the case or do
something to save the skin of the one
who is innocent or who is actually
responsible for the commission of the
crime. The Court, therefore, is
required to exercise much greater
cere and circumspection while
appraising evidence.”

13. In another case, reported as “Malik Aamir Sultan

and _02_others Vs The State and another” (2018 MLD
1635), it was held that:

“The number of injuries does not
commensurate with the number of
accused party. More so, all the
injuries bear one and the same
dimension. It reflects that it is the job
of one person but in order to throw
the net wide, the number of accused
has been exaggera'ed as three
brothers and two unknown accused
have been charged. The empties

recovered were not sent in order to
-17-

ascertain whether the same were
fired from one or different weapons.
What was the reason that this
opinion was not sought by the
Investigating Officer, :the answer of
that is not available on the record of
the case and it can be presumed that
the Investigating Officer was
conscious of the fact that number of
the accused has been exaggerated
and if such report is sought, that
would be detrimental'to the case of
the prosecution. Thus, there is
element of concealment and
exaggeration as well which further
nullifies the mode and manner as set
out by the prosecution.”

14, As on one hand, the ocular account is not worthy of
credence and on the other, the medical evidence runs in
conflict with the statements of the witnesses, then this Court
is not hesitant to hold that the conflict between the two has
yielded favourable results to the appellants. In case titled
“Bashir Muhammad Khan Vs The State” (2022 SCMR
986), it was held that:

“The medical evidence is
inconsistent with the ocular account
as regards injury No. 3 on the right
hip of the deceased is concerned,
which in-fact was an-exit wound but

according to the prosecution
-18-

witnesses of ocular account the
same was an entry wound in these
circumstances, a dent in the
prosecution's case has been created,
benefit of which must be given to the
appellant. It is a settled law that
single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in q prudent mind
about the guilt of uccused makes
him entitled to its benefits, not as a
matter of grace and concession but
as a matter of right. The conviction
must be based on unimpeachable;
trustworthy and reliable evidence.
Any doubt arising it prosecution's
case is to be resolved in favour of
the accused and burden of proof is
always on prosecution to prove its
case beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt. However, as discussed above,
in the present case the prosecution
has failed to prove its case beyond

any reasonable shadow of doubt.”
15. The investigating officer after collecting empties
from the spot, sent the same to the office of firearms expert
to ascertain as to whether the same were fired from one or
different weapons. The laboratory report was received,
where all the empties were opined to have been fired from
different weapons. As in the episode, three accused are

charged for effective fire shots and empties of different
-19-

calibers were collected from the spot, then in case of
different weapons, an inference can be drawn that more
than three weapons were used in the episode and in such
eventuality, possibility cannot be excluded that not only the
accused, but the complainant side fired as well. The
suppression of facts on part of the prosecution is another
circumstance which tilts the balance. True that laboratory
report is not a corroborative piece of evidence, rather a
circumstance which can be pressed into service, only and
only, when either the prosecution succeeds or fails in
respect of its story. As in the instant case, the ocular
account is in conflict with the report tendered by the
laboratory, so the importance of this document cannot be
ignored and as such, it can be pressed into service not for
the benefit of the prosecution, but for the benefit of the
accused / appellants and this evidence has further created
dents in the prosecution case. |

16. The motive was alleged that a few days earlier, the
accused / appellant Nasir physically assaulted one
Muhammad Qadir and PW Syed Anwar Shah, which matter
was reported in the shape of dajly diary No.09, dated
23.03.2019, but on one hand, no independent witness was
produced in that respect, whereas, on the other, the
complainant and injured witness were physically assaulted

on 20.03.2019, but the matter was reported on 23.03.2019.
-20-

The record further tells that while making the report in the
shape of daily diary, both the witnesses did not opt for their
medical examination and as such, their this option has
created mystery regarding the earlier episode. The daily
diary so entered has lost its efficacy and its contents has
confirmed that the document was fabricated with the sole
purpose to help the prosecution ane as such, this document
can be termed as a suspect document, which cannot be
taken into consideration. When the very document has lost
its veracity, then the same cannot be taken into
consideration and we are constrained to hold that the
prosecution failed to prove the moive. As the motive was
between PW Syed Anwar Shah, Muhammad Qadir and the
accused/ appellant Nasir, so we failed to understand that
what led the remaining accused to participate in the
incident. Had this been the motive, then the deceased had
nothing to do with the same and: in that eventuality, the
prime target would have been the eye-witness. The
attending circumstances of the present case tell nothing, but
that the prosecution could not establish the alleged motive
and as such, it is the prosecution to suffer. True that
absence or weakness of motive is fo ground for dislodging
the prosecution case, but equally true that when motive is
the sole purpose for committing the offence then failure on

the part of the prosecution to prove the same would react
-21-

against the prosecution and the present case is no exception.

In case titled “Muhammad Ilyas Vs Ishfag alias Munshi
and others (2022 YLR 1620), it was held that:

“It is well settled that once a motive

is set up it is imperative for the

prosecution to proye the same. On

failure whereof adverse inference

can be dawn against — the

prosecution. Reference is made to

the cases of Muhammad Khan v.

Zakir Hussain PLD 1995 SC 590

and Hakim Ali v .The State 1971

SCMR 432.”
17. The record tells that two of the accused surrendered
to the local police after few days of the incident and that
their this conduct is a circumstance, which tells a lot of their
innocence. There is no denial of the fact that in the incident,
two persons lost their lives; had the accused / appellants i.e.
Abid and Hanif, been guilty, then under no circumstances
they would have surrendered to the local police. This aspect
of the case coupled with the inherent defects in the
prosecution story has created a room for the accused /
appellants and the benefit of doubt has accrued to them,

which the learned trial Court failed to appreciate.
a7

-22-

18. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above
leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution
could not succeed in bringing home guilt against the
appellants and that the impugned judgment is suffering
from inherent defects, which calls for interference. The
learned trial judge while appreciating the available record
misdirected himself both in law and on facts of the case.
We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned
judgment. The appellants are acquitted of the charges, they
shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

19. The above are the detailed reasons for our short order
of even date.
