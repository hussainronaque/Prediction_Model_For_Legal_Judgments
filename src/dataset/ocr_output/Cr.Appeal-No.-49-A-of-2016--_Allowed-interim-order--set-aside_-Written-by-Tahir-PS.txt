IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Through the instant appeal, appellants
have questioned the validity and legality of the impugned
judgment/order dated 28.03.2016 rendered by learned Judge,
Consumer Court, District Haripur, whereby the appellants were
directed to restore the gas supply to respondent concern to the
extent of 14 MCF and to receive amount of Rs. 2,19,359/13.

In essence, a complaint under Section 13 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997 was instituted by
the respondent before the learned Judge, Consumer Court with the
following prayer:-

“Declaration to the effect that act of respondent No. 1
whereby he on basis of pure mala-fide, illegality, un-
lawfully and using his power in an absolute disregard
to norms of justice is illegality and unlawfully bent
upon personally to disclose the glass manufacturing
unit situated at industrial estate Hattar by petitioner
by:-

i. Illegally and unlawfully disconnecting the gas
supplies of petitioner And
ii. By sending wrong gas to bill for the month of
December 2015, is illegal, unlawful, without
lawful authority, without jurisdiction, arbitrary,
mala-fide, perverse, in utter violation of law
and rules, consequently, of no legal effect And
praying that correct gas bill be graciously sent.
Furthermore, any other relief which the
Hon’ble Court deem fit and proper may also be

graciously awarded.

2. Permanent injunction restraining
defendants not to send any bill with excessive,
illegal and unlawful readings strictly in
accordance with law and rules on the subject.
2. During the course of pendency of the complaint ibid,
thereafter, on conclusion of evidence, on behalf of respondent-
company the learned Judge, Consumer Court on 25.03.2016 made
direction for restoration of the Gas Supply to respondent and case
was adjourned to 13.04.2016 but, without any plausible reason,
the record was requisitioned on 28.03.2016 by the learned Judge,
and on the request of learned counsel for respondent, the
impugned judgment was passed.
3. Learned counsel for appellants contended that, the
impugned judgment is without jurisdiction, against law and facts
on record as, the learned judge could not pass declaratory nature
of orders, while, the jurisdiction of consumer Court is limited and
could exercise the powers, as envisaged thereunder section 15 of
the KPK Consumer Protection Act, 1997.
4. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent argued

that no appeal could be entertained against an interlocutory order
passed by the Consumer Court, therefore, the appeal filed by the
appellants is not maintainable, to be dismissed accordingly.
Further contended that as the matter purely pertaining to supply of
services, where respondent is consumer while appellants are
service provider, therefore, the impugned judgment is
passed/rendered by a competent Court, could not be interfered
with by this court as no any illegality or irregularity has been

occasioned thereof.

5. I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone
through the record.
6. The record reveals that respondent has challenged the gas

bill issued to respondent by appellants-department for the month
of December, 2015 and has sought declaration in that regard, that
the same be declared illegal.

7. As it is crystal clear therefrom the facts alleged by
respondent, that the matter in issue is directly and exclusively
pertaining to providing of service as mentioned in clause (n) of
section 2 of the KPK Consumer Protection Act, 1997 (Consumer
Act), the manner in which the complaint shall be made as
prescribed thereunder sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the

Consumer Act shall be followed by the Court, which reads as:-

“The (Court) shall if the complaint received relates to
goods in respect of which the produce specified in sub-
section (1) cannot be followed, or if the compliant

relates to any service,

(a). refer a copy of such complaint to the opposite

party directing him to give his version of the case
within a period of thirty days or such extended period
not exceeding fifteen days as may be granted by the

(court; and

(b). on receipt of the defence of the opposite party, if
any, under clause (b), proceed to settle the dispute on

the basis of evidence produced by both the parties.

Provided that if the opposite party does not deny or
dispute the allegations made in the complaint or fails
to present his case within the specified period, the
dispute shall be settled on the basis of the evidence
brought by the (complainant).
8. The above mentioned provision of law, has specifically,
provided a procedure to be adopted by the Court and have got no
any power or jurisdiction to pass any kind of direction,
whatsoever, of the kind either to restore or disconnect any
services or make any direction for payment in installment or
reduced rate or to make direction to any department in case of
supply of energy to enhance the load, without giving its findings

in view of the provision contained in section 15 of the KPK

Consumer Act, 1997 which reads as:-

“S.15(1) If afier the proceedings conducted under
section 14 the (Court) is satisfied that the goods
complained against suffer from any of the defects
specified in the complaint or that any or all of the
allegations contained in the complaint about the
services are proved, it shall issue an order to the
opposite party directing him to take one or more of the

following actions namely.

(a). to remove defect from the goods in question;
(b). to replace the goods with new goods of similar

description which shall be free from any defect;

(c). to do such other things as may be directed for
adequate and proper compliance with the

requirements of section 4, section 5 or section 6;

(d). to pay such amount as may be awarded by it as

compensation to the consumer for any loss or

negligence of the opposite party.
9. However, the Consumer Court could punish such a
defaulter or a person responsible for causing any infringement of
rights of Consumer in view of the provision contained in section
16 of the Consumer Act, but in the case in hand the respondent
has not registered any such grievance, which may give
jurisdiction to the consumer Court with regard to any defect in the
goods or services provided to the respondent by appellants. The
matter is purely pertaining to dispute over, the gas bill for the
month of December, 2015, which could not be resolved by the
learned Consumer Court below. However, even if the jurisdiction
is assumed and it was found that, the respondent has received an
excessive amount, could be recovered in view of clause (c) of sub
section (1) of section 15 of the KPK Consumer Act, 1997.

Clause (c) of section 14 of the consumer Act, placed some
embargo, on the power of the Consumer Court to fulfill
requirement so mentioned, therefore, if any defect in the goods is
complained, which reads as:-

Section 14 (c) “Where the (complaint) alleges a defect
in the goods which cannot be determined without

proper analysis or test of the goods, the (court) shall
obtain sample of the goods from complainant, seal it
and authenticate it in the manner prescribed and refer
the sample so sealed to a laboratory along with a
direction to make an analysis or test, whichever may
be necessary with a view to finding out whether such
goods suffer from any defect and to report its findings
thereon to the (court) within a such period as may be

extended by the (court);

10. As, respondent on one hand was stated to be defaulter to
pay Rs.97,69,020/- while on the other hand, he had used,
unsanctioned excessive load, for which he had not paid, such
complicated and technical question could not be resolved by
consumer Court as, jurisdiction conferred upon it, is not that of a
civil court, except those powers mentioned thereunder sub-section
3 of section 14 of the Act ibid.

11. So far as the maintainability of the appeal against the
interim order passed by the Consumer Court is concerned, no any
bar could be placed on appeal against any order passed by the
consumer Court in view of section 17 of the Consumer Act,
which reads as:-

“S.17.- Any person aggrieved by an order made by the
(Court) may prefer an appeal against such order to the
(High Court) within period of thirty days from the date
of the order, and the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), in respect

of appeal to the High Court shall mutatis mutandis,

apply.
12. The contention of learned counsel for respondent that an
appeal shall be preferred only against the order passed thereunder
section 15 or 16 by the Consumer Act is misconceived. No any
bar has been placed to challenge an interlocutory order, otherwise,
the verse of section 17 of the Act, may be drafted as:

“Any person aggrieved by a final order made by the
Court may prefer an appeal against such order to the
(High Court) within period of thirty days from the date
of the order, and the provisions of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), in respect
of appeal to the High Court shall mutatis mutandis,

apply”.

13. No words could be introduced or the plain meaning
occurred therein a statute could not be so construed or interpreted
to give a new and altogether a different interpretation to frustrate
the law.

14. The jurisdiction of the Consumer Court is not exhaustive
but limited to the extent and manner as provided thereunder
clause (0) of section 2 and sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Act while
the provision contained in section 3 of the Consumer Act has not
excluded the application of any other law for the time being
enforced for redressal of any grievance. Section 9 of CPC,
otherwise, confers, exclusive and general jurisdiction upon the
Civil Court, if the cognizance of a particular dispute has not been
ousted or barred.

15. Reference may be given herein to the judgment of this

Court rendered in case titled “M/s. Nulab CNG filling station Vs.
Managing Director, Sui Northern Gas Pipeline limited and 4

others reported as PLD\d 2013 Peshawar 09. .
16. The Hon’ble Lahore High Court in case titled “Sui
Northern Gas Pipe Lines limited through its General Manager vs

Shahzada Khush Bakht Khan” P.LJ 2015 Lahore 183 is as under:-

“the bare reading of these section reveals that the
Consumer Court established under Punjab Consumer
Protection Act, 2005 is not a Court of general
jurisdiction. It is its duty to examine the allegations
raised in the complaint in order to determine its
jurisdiction. Prayer for cancellation of gas bill or
revising of gas bill by a gas company could not have
conferred jurisdiction upon the consumer court and
the same falls outside the purview of this special

tribunal”.

17. No any distinction could be placed between Section 31 of
the Punjab Consumer Protection Act, 2005 and Section 15 of the
KPK Consumer Act 1997, while section 31 of the Punjab
Consumer Act conferred somewhat advanced/exhaustive
jurisdiction upon the Consumer Act as mentioned therein clause
(f) to (K) of section 31. .

18. It would be not out of context, to give reference to the
OGRA Ordinance, 2002 whereas section 43 of the Ordinance ibid
has given overriding effect with regard to other laws which reads

as:-

The provisions of this Ordinance, the rules and
regulations, and any licences issued thereunder shall
have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained in any other law, rule or regulation, for the
time being in force, and any such law, rule or
regulation shall, to the extent of any inconsistency,
cease to have any effect on the commencement of this
Ordinance and the Authority. Shall, subject to the
provisions of this ordinance be exclusively empowered
to determine the matters in its jurisdiction as set out in

this Ordinance.

(2) Nothing in this Ordinance,, or any repeal effected
thereby, shall affect or be deemed to affect anything
done, action taken, proceedings commenced,
directions given, instruments executed or orders, rules
or regulations issued under or in pursuance of any law
repealed or amended by this Ordinance and any such
thing, actions, proceedings, directions, instruments or
orders shall, if in force on the commencement of this
Ordinance, continue to be in force and have effect as if
the same were respectively done, taken, commenced,

given, executed or issued under this Ordinance.

19. | Whereas, section 42 of the Ordinance, 2002 has conferred

power upon the Authority to make Regulation, which reads as:-

“The Authority may, by notification in the official
Gazette, make regulations, not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance or the rules, for the

carrying out of its functions under this Ordinance: -

(2). In particular and without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing powers, such regulations
may provide for all or any of the following matters,

namely: -

(a). maintenance and submission of records by any
person involved directly or indirectly in a regulated
activity and the inspection of the records by the

Authority:
20.
made the Complaint Resolution Procedure (for Natural Gas,
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and compressed Natural Gas

(CNG) Regulations, 2003, while Section 3 of the Regulation

10

(b). establishment of technical standards and _ their
monitoring for the design, construction, testing,
operation, maintenance and abandonment of a

regulated activity,

(c). administration of the Oil and Gas Regulatory
Authority Fund;

(d). establishment of terms and conditions of
employment and remuneration policies for staff,

consultants and advisers of the Authority;

(e). procedure for resolving disputes amongst the
licensees, consumers and licensees, and users of open

access facilities;

(f). procedure, processes and practice for carrying out

functions of the Authority.

(g). procedure for appeal of decision or order made by

delegates pursuant to section 10;

(h). prescription of forms and procedures for an
application for a regulated activity and the time for

submission; and

(i). any other matter incidental or consequential to the

performance of the functions of the Authority.”

The Authority mentioned therein the ordinance 2002, has

provides as under:-

Nature of Complaints. Any person may submit an

application with the Registrar for
11

(a). any act or thing done or omitted to be done by a
licensee or dealer in violation or alleged violation of the
ordinance, rules, regulations, order of the Authority or

terms and condition of the license;

(b). non-compliance by the licensee or dealer with the

service standards in the areas including but not limited to:

i. billing.
ii. Connection and disconnection of service;
iii. Metering;
iv. Undue delay in providing service;
v. Safety practices; or
vi. Quantity and quality of natural gas, LPG or CNG

being supplied; or

vii. Discriminatory practices of the licensee or dealer.

21. The grievance of any aggrieved person could be resolved
through the mechanism provided thereunder the Ordinance, 2002
and the Regulations mentioned hereinabove, while section 43 of
the Ordinance has excluded the operation of any other law, in
matters specifically provided thereunder the Regulation etc.

22. Article 143 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan has in very wide command has specified that in case, of
any conflict between Federal and Provincial laws, the former
would be applied. As the OGRA Ordinance is a Federal law and
keeping in view the overriding effect as envisaged thereunder
Section 43 of the Ordinance, 2002, questions, disputes and all

connected matters, whose cognizance has been conferred upon the
12

authority under OGRA Ordinance, shall be resolved by it, while it
is also otherwise, settled principle of law, that the provision of a
special law on a subject excludes the application of General law
to such subject. As the OGRA ordinance is a special law and so
far as the petroleum and its products including Sui Gas, is
concermed, the jurisdiction of the consumer Court in matters, not
specifically mentioned thereunder, the Consumer Protection Act
1997 is ousted by virtue of section 43 of the OGRA Ordinance.
Reference be given to the case law reported as PLD 1985 SC 159
titled “Inspector General of Police, Punjab Lahore Vs. Mushtaq
Ahmad Warraich”’.

23. Before passing with this judgment, it would be appreciated
that the Federal Government has enacted a fresh Act, called the
Gas (Theft Control and Recovery) Act, 2016, the pre-amble of

which reads as:-

“whereas it is expedient to prosecute cases of gas theft
and other offences relating to gas and to provide for a
procedure for expeditious recovery of amounts due,
value of gas, fixes, penalties and other outstanding
amounts payable and sums due to gas utility
companies and for matters ancillary and related

thereto, while section 6 of the Act ibid stipulates as:-

(D. where a person is involved in an offence under this
Act or where there are sums due or recoverable from

any person or where_a_consumer_has_a_ dispute

regarding billing or_metering against _a_ Gas utility

company, a consumer or Gas utility company, as the

case may be, may file a complaint or suit, as the case

may be, before a Gas utility Court as prescribed by the
13

code of civil procedure, 1908(Act V of 1908) or the
code of criminal procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898).
24. Keeping in view the ordinary effect of section 43 of the
OGRA Ordinance, 2002 and the Regulations framed thereunder,
or in view of section 6 of the Gas (Theft Control and Recovery)
Act, 2016, are to apply in matters pertaining to billing of Gas and
not the provisions of KPK Consumer Protection Act, 1997.
25. Thus the jurisdiction assumed by the learned Judge
Consumer Court District, Haripur in the instant matter is without
jurisdiction, lawful Authority and the impugned judgment/order
passed by it is a nullity in the eye of law, which is hereby set
aside by accepting this appeal and consequently, the very
complaint filed by the respondent has become redundant and is
dismissed accordingly.
26. However, respondent may approach, in this regard for
redressal of his grievance if any and if so advised, before

competent forum/Court.
