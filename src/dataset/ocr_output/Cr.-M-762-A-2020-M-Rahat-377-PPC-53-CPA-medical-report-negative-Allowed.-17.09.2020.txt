JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr. M (Bail) No. 762-A/2020.

Date of hearing 17.09.2020.

Petitioner/s(Muhammad Rahat) by Mr.
Sajid Iqbal, Advocate.

Respondent/s (The State) by Raja
Muhammad Zubair, AAG and
(complainant) by Ghulam Mustafa
Awan, Advocate.

MOHAMMAD _IBRAHIM KHAN, _J.
Petitioner Muhammad Rahat through the
instant petition seeks his post-arrest bail in
case FIR No. 933 dated 11.08.2020 under
sections 377/34 PPC read with section
53Child Protection Act registered at Police
Station, Havelian, District, Abbottabad.

Same relief was, however, declined to

them by the learned lower forum.

2. Complainant through the present
FIR has charged the present accused/
petitioner for committing carnal
intercourse against the order of nature with

his minor son Abdul Mohiz.
3. I have given my anxious thought to
the blue streak arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and gone through
the record with their able assistance.

4. Scrupulous perusal of record
reveals that the occurrence took place on
11.08.2020 at 12:00 PM, while the same
was reported at 17:30 hours (with delay of
about seven hours), which is not explained
by the complainant in the Murasila/FIR
despite the fact that on the day of
occurrence, he returned home at 1:30
hours.

5. No doubt, the complainant, in his
report, has charged the accused/petitioner
for the commission of sodomy with his
minor son but contrary to that the medical
report of  accused/petitioner dated:
12.08.2020 available on file reveals as
under:-

Rahat Fareed son of M.
Fareed is medically examined,
no pubic hair nor axillary hair
are seen. No ejacuation is
seen.

6. It is a daylight occurrence and

except the solitary statement of
complainant, no other eyewitness has been
cited so as to support his version.

7. Apart from the above, the
accused/petitioner is admittedly minor
having age about 13 / 14 years. As per
report of Forensic Science Laboratory,
Semen of human origin was not detected
on the articles in P. No. 1 & 2, which also
goes in favour of accused/petitioner.

8. So far as applicability of sections
53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(hereinafter to be referred as the Act of
2010), is concerned, it depicts that this law
was specially introduced/enacted and
promulgated in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
with particular purposes i.e. to provide for
the care, protection, maintenance, welfare,
training, education, rehabilitation and
reintegration of 'children at risk’ in the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference, the
preamble of the Act of 2010, is reproduced
below:-

"WHEREAS, it is expedient to provide
for the care, protection, maintenance,
welfare, training, education,
rehabilitation and _ reintegration of
children at risk in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa".

"Child at risk" has been defined under
section 2(1)(e) of the Act in the following
words:-

"Child at risk" means a child in need of
protection, who

(i) is at risk, including an orphan,
child with disabilities, child of migrant
workers, child working and or living on
the street, child in conflict with the law
and child living in extreme poverty.

(ii) is found begging; or

(iii) is found without having any home
or settled place of abode or without any
ostensible meaning of subsistence; or

(iv) has a parent or guardian who is
unfit or incapacitated to exercise control
over the child; or

(v) lives in a brothel or with a
prostitute or frequently visits any place
being used for the purpose of prostitution
or is found to associate with any
prostitute or any other person who leads
an immoral or depraved life; or

(vi) _ is being or is likely to be abused
or exploited for immoral or illegal
purposes or gain; or

(vii) is beyond the parental control; or

(viii) is imprisoned with the mother or
born in jail;

(ix) has lost his parents or one of the
parents and has no adequate source of
income; or

(x) is victim of an offence punishable
under this Act or any other law for the
time being in force and his parent or
guardian is convicted or accused for the
commission of such offence; Or

(xi) _ is left abandoned by his parent or

parents as the case may be, which will
include a child born out of wedlock and
left abandoned by his parent;
9. Keeping the Preamble of the Act in
juxtaposition with the definition of the
"Child at risk" as contemplated under
section 2(1)(e) of the Act coupled with
the facts and circumstances of the instant
case, it could not be ascertained as to
whether the alleged victim, falls under the
definition of "Child at risk" or otherwise.
In such an eventuality, the applicability of
sections 53 of the Act of 2010, to the case
of petitioners is yet a begging question.
Wisdom can be derived from case law
reported in 2016 SCMR_ 1523, 2014
MLD 190 & 2018 YLR Note 114. In the
given scenario, applicability of sections
342 & 511 PPC would also require debate

during trial.

10. In such eventuality, when the child
did not fall under the definition of “Child
at risk” as provided under Section 53,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection
and Welfare Act, 2010; and when at the
moment, except the solitary statement of
complainant, no other incriminating

evidence is available on record to show
any nexus of the accused/petitioner with
the commission of crime, at least at this

stage.

11. Moreover, in the instant case, no
compliance with the provision of Section
164-B Cr.P.C has been made because no
samples for DNA test have been obtained
either from the accused/petitioner or
victim despite the fact that the word
“shall” is used in the said provision,
making its applicability mandatory. The
prosecution must keep in mind this aspect
while dealing with such like offences, in
the best interest of the victim as well as

the accused.

12. Investigation in the case is
complete and accused/petitioners is no
more required to the prosecution for the
very purpose. Even otherwise, in view of
the above stated facts, the case calls for
further inquiry under Sub-Section (2) of
Section 497 Cr.P.C, therefore, further
retention of the petitioner in jail will serve

no useful purpose.
13. Apart from the above, it has been
held time and again by the august
Supreme Court that bail does not mean
acquittal of accused but only change of
custody from Government agencies to
the sureties, who on furnishing bonds
take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required
to be produced. Reliance could be placed
on case reported in 2008 SCMR_ 807
“Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

14. So, by cutting the cackle, on
tentative assessment of material available
on file, a case for the grant of bail is
made out. Consequently, this bail
application is allowed and
accused/petitioner is admitted to bail
provided he furnishes bail bonds in the
sum of Rs. 200,000/- (two lakh) with two
sureties, each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of [Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure
that the sureties are local, reliable and

men of means.
15. Before parting with this order, this
court finds it necessary to mention that all
the observations recorded above are
tentative assessment just for the disposal
of bail petition and not intended to
influence the mind of trial Court, which is
free to appraise the evidence strictly in
accordance with law and merits of the

case.

16. Above are the reasons of short

order of even date.

Announced.
17.09.2020.
