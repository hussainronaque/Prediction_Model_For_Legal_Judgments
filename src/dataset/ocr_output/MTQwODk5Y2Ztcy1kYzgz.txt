ORDER

ZULFIQAR ALI SANGI, J.- By this common order, | propose to dispose
of Cr. Bail Application Nos. S- 714 & 944 of 2019, arising out of F.I.R
No.103 of 2019 of P.S S.F Rahu registered under Sections 324, 114, 147,
148, 149, 337-H(ii), 504 P.P.C, wherein applicants Taj Muhammad,
Muhammad Bux alias Karo, Soomar, Lal Bux and Ali Bux in bail application
No-S- 714 of 2019 and Applicant Abdul Rehman in Cr. Bail Application No:
944 of 2019 seek pre-arrest bail, after dismissal of their bail application by
the 2"? Additional Session Judge, Badin vide order dated 01.07.2109.

2. Allegations as per FIR are that on the day of incident applicants
along with deadly weapons came at the place of incident when applicant Ali
Bux instigated other accused persons not to spare complainant party on
which Taj Muhammad made straight fire upon Haji Muhammad, Soomar
made straight fire upon Ali Hassan, Abdul Rehman made fire upon Mir

Muhammad. The crises of complainant attracted the villagers and on seeing
them all the accused escaped away. After receiving letter for treatment and
leaving the injured at hospital, complainant went at police station and lodged
the F.I.R, the motive for committing the offence stated as enmity on

agricultural lands.

3. Learned counsel for applicants submits that the applicants are
involved due to enmity which is admitted in the FIR: that though there are
allegations that Haji Muhammad received firearm injury but he was never
appeared before the doctor nor any medical certificate is available in police
file; that the offence for which applicants are charged does not fall within the
prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C: that seat of injuries is not
mentioned by complainant; that all the Sections are bailable except Section
324, that police at the instance of complainant party is behind the applicants
to arrest them only for humiliation in the eyes of public, that applicants are
involved in this case with malafide intention. He lastly prayed for

confirmation of bail to the applicants.

4. Learned counsel for complainant argued that names of applicants are
mentioned in the FIR; that specific role has been assigned against the
applicants for causing firearm injuries to the complainant party; that ocular
evidence is supported by medical evidence; that grounds taken by
applicants are of deeper appreciation of evidence which is not permissible

at bail stage. Lastly he prayed for dismissal of bail application.

5. Learned DPG after verifying the police file stated that injuries are
declared by doctor as Damiyah and are bailable; therefore, he has no

objection if the bail of applicants is confirmed.

6. | have heard the arguments of learned counsel and perused the
record.
7. Admittedly deeper appreciation of evidence is not required to decide

the bail plea and material is to be assessed tentatively, the enmity is
admitted by both the parties, the injuries declared by the doctor are bailable,
allegedly injured Haji Khan was not appeared before the doctor which
create serious doubt in the prosecution case, case has already been
challaned and applicants are no more required for further investigation, the
ingredients of Section 324 PPC are missing as none of the applicants
repeated fire which shows their intention for committing murder of

complainant party. Tentatively applicants have been able to make out their
case for confirmation of bail; therefore the interim pre-arrest bail granted to
applicants namely Taj Muhammad, Soomar, Muhammad Bux alias Karo, Lal
Bux and Ali Bux vide order dated: 04-07-2019 in Cr. Bail Application No. S-
714 of 2019 and to applicant Abdul Rehman vide order dated 30.09.2019 in
Cr. Bail Application No. S-944 of 2019 is hereby confirmed on the same

terms and conditions.

8. Needless to mention that the observations made hereinabove are

tentative in nature and shall not prejudice the right of either party at trial.
