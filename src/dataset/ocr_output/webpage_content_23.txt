SADIQ HUSSIAN BHATTI, J. - Applicant
Syed Rahim was booked by SHO Police Station Rizvia Society in Crime No.249/2012
under section 6/9-B, CNS Act. The applicant moved instant application for grant
of bail. Interim bail was granted to him vide order of this Court dated 08.10.2012.

 
2.       Brief
facts of the prosecution case are that while patrolling in the area the police
party intercepted the accused persons, when accused Gul Rahim was arrested on
the spot and the Applicant escaped away by throwing his beg, containing 92
grams garda charras and 20 rods weighing 200 grams of charas, the same was
taken into custody and brought to the police station and the FIR was registered.

 
3.       Learned
counsel for the applicant argued that the applicant is innocent and has been
falsely implicated in the subject FIR on the confessional statement of
co-accused while in custody, which has no legal value. He further argued that the
alleged incident took place in a thickly populated area but no private
witnesses have been associated, thus violated the provisions of section 103
Cr.PC. He finally argued that case of the prosecution is doubtful, which
require further inquiry into the guilt of the applicant. The offence alleged is
punishable for 07 seven year with fine or both; co-accused Rahim Gul has also
been admitted to bail by the trial Court and on the rule of consistency the
applicant is also entitled for concession of bail. 
 
4.       On
the other hand, learned Assistant Prosecutor General Sindh Mr. Shahid Hussain Shiakh,
has reluctantly opposed the grant of bail. On a query by the Court regarding
sending the case property to the chemical examiner, learned A.P.G. stated that
the incident took place on 16.09.2012, property was sent for chemical examination
on 18.09.2012 and the same was received in the office of Chemical Examiner on
24th September, 2012 with a delay of 06 days, to which the learned
A.P.G. failed to submit any plausible explanation. 
 
5.       Heard
counsel for the parties and perused the record with their assistance. 
 
6.       The
incident took place on 16.09.2012, the allegation against the applicant is that
on the date of incident when police conducted raid co-accused Gul Rahim was
arrested on the spot whereas the Applicant escaped away by throwing his beg,
containing 92 grams garda charras and 20 rods weighing 200 grams of charas.
Subsequently, the case was challaned before the trial Court and the accused,
who was arrested on the spot, was granted bail after arrest by the trial Court
on 23.10.2012. It is very strange to note that the incident took place on
16.09.2012, the alleged contraband items were sent for chemical examination on
18.09.2012 but the same were received in the office of Chemical Examiner on
24.09.2012 and there is no explanation as to where the case property was kept
during the period of 06 days. The quantity of charas is not
exceeding 1000 grams and offence do not fall within the prohibitory clause of
section 497 Cr.PC. After grant of bail applicant is regularly attending
the trial Court and has not misused the concession. Interim pre-arrest bail
granted earlier to the Applicant is hereby confirmed on the same terms and
conditions.
