JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 04/3/2019

Appellant-Petitioner: By Haji Hamayun Khan
Wazir, Advocate.

Respondent: Nemo for Respondents.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- Javed and others, the

petitioners in this case have filed this Constitutional petition
filed U/A-199 of the Constitutional of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan 1973, the petitioners have impugned the order
dated 16.01.2019, passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge/

Judicial Magistrate, Lakki Marwat in crime No. 475 dated

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
21.7.2016 registered U/Ss.  354/452/337-F(V)/148/149,

whereby recommendation/request of the investigating officer

to discharge the accused was turned down and he was

directed to further investigate the case in the light of

observation of the Regional Review Board dated 07.02.2017

and thereafter submit the report U/S. 173 Cr.P.C.

2. The facts of the case, in brief, are that the

complainant Munawar Khan had lodged an FIR on 21.7.2016

at PS Lakki Marwat alleging that at about 05:00 hours, he

was busy in reciting the Holy QURAN in his home, in the

meanwhile, his neighbors threw stones from his house into

his home and at once, accused Javbed Alias Fouji,

Hameedullah sons of Taj Muhammad,  Pervaiz,

Hameedullah, Waheedullah sons of Noor Muhammad,

Momin s/o Muhammad Ameen, Dilawar, Jehangir sons of

Gul Sarwar, Arifullah s/o Mir Badshah, Muhammad Jan s/o

Mira Gul entered into his home and started giving danda

blows to the women-folk and torn the clothes of his father

and sister namely-Mst:Hukam Jana Bibi, while he sustained
*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
injury on his left hand. He charged the accused for the

commission of offence.

3. It was argued by the learned counsel for the

petitioners that the I.O had submitted his report after proper

investigation, but same was disbelieved by the learned

Judicial Magistrate and directed to further investigate the

case vide impugned order dated 16.01.2019 for no cogent

reasons. It was next contended that the learned Judicial

Magistrate has passed the impugned order in a slipshod

manner and had no jurisdiction to issued direction to I.O to

further investigate the case.

4. We have heard the arguments of the learned

counsel for the petitioners and have scanned the record with

their able assistance.

5. It may be noted that investigating agency is

under obligation to complete every investigation without

unnecessary delay as required under Section-173 (1) of

Cr.P.C, and as soon as completed, the officer incharge of the

police station shall forward to a magistrate empowered to
*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
take cognizance of the offence. On a police report, a report in

form prescribed by Provincial Government setting forth the

names of the parties, the nature of accusation information

and the names of the person who appear to be acquainted

with the facts of the case and stating whether the accused, if

arrested has been forwarded in custody or has been released

on his own bond. This section contemplates that on

conclusion of investigation, the concerned SHO was required

to submit a report of the result thereof in the prescribed

manner to the Judicial Magistrate competent to take

cognizance U/S. 190 Cr.P.C or to submit a report to the

Judicial Magistrate concerned for disposal of the case in

accordance with law. Perusal of Section. 190 Cr.P.C reveals

that magistrate can take cognizance upon receiving complaint

of the facts, which constituted offence, upon request in

writing of such facts made by any police officer, and upon

information received from any person other than police

officer upon his own knowledge or suspicion or suspicion

that such offence has been committed. Magistrate only after
*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
taking cognizance of a case is to determine whether the

matter before him is exclusively triable by a court of

Sessions, once he arrives at the conclusion that it is so

triable, his own jurisdiction to try the same would cease, and

in such event he must send the case to the court of Sessions

for trial.

6. Now question for determination before us is that

if the magistrate disagrees with the report of police, can he

take action under Clause (b) against those whose names have

been recommended for discharge and to be placed in column

No.2. It is well-settled that a report submitted by the police

officer U/S. 173 Cr.P.C, is not binding on the court. The

court, therefore, notwithstanding the recommendation of the

1.0 regarding cancellation of the case and discharge of the

accused from case, may decline to cancel the case and

proceed to take cognizance of the matter as provided U/S.

190 Cr.P.C, In this behalf reliance can be placed on the case

reported as Federation of Pakistan V Malik Mumtaz

Hussain (1997 SCMR 299). In this context reliance can also

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
be placed on the case reported as Muhammad Ahmad V The

State (2010 SCMR 660), wherein it was observed as under:-

"It may be mentioned here, for the
benefit and guidance of all concerned, that
determination of guilt or innocence of the accused
persons was the exclusive domain of only the Courts
of law established for the purpose and the said
sovereign power of the Courts could never be
permitted to be exercised by the employees of the
police department or by anyone else for that matter.
If the tendency of allowing such-like impressions of
the Investigating Officer to creep into the evidence
was not curbed them the same could lead to
disastrous consequences. If an Investigating Officer
was of the opinion that such an accused person was
innocent then why could not, on the same principle,
another accused person be hanged to death only
because the Investigating Officer had opined about
his guilt"

7. Undisputedly, the magistrate is competent to

pass any order on the report submitted by the investigating

officer and take cognizance of the offence or even order for

further investigation. If any case law is needed reference may

be made to the case reported as Imran V Liagat Ali (2010

YLR 3288).

*Imranullah* (D.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz and Mr.Justice Shakeel Ahmad
8. In the present case, the learned Snior Civil

Judge/Judicial Magistrate has applied her mind to the facts

and circumstances of the case and has passed order giving

reasons of disagreement with the report of the investigating

officer.

9. The learned counsel for the petitioners has not

been able to point-out any illegality in the impugned order

showing disagreement with the report of investigation officer

and to further investigate the case in the light of observations

of the Regional Review Board dated 07.02.2017.

10. For the forgoing reasons, we do not find any

illegality or irregularity in the impugned order which is

hereby upheld. The writ petition being devoid of force is

hereby dismissed in LIMINE.

Announced.
