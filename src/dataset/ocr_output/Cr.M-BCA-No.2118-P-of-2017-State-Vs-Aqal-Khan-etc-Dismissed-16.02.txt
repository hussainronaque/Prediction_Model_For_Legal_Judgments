QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J.- The State through the

Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar
(Petitioner) assailed release on bail of all the three
accused/respondents by the Judge, Anti Terrorism Court,
Kohat Division, Kohat in case FIR No.09 dated
20.05.2017 under Sections 302/324/353/427/148/149 PPC
and 7 ATA Police Station CTD Kohat Region.

2. The FIR in the case lodged on the report of
Amanullah Khan SI Investigation Staff Lachi would show
that no one was charged by name in the FIR for the ambush
on the raiding police party returning in the motorcar and
official vehicle after performance of their duty. The
complainant/SI, however, claimed that he and_ his

companion constables saw two armed persons in the
headlights of the vehicle and that he could identify them if
brought before him. According to the complainant, they
also returned firing in order to overpower the said persons
who had opened fire at them but they managed to escape
while taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes.
As a result of firing by the assailants, Khanullah SHO
occupying the driving seat and Tahir Mahmood ASHO
occupying the front seat while Tanveer Hussain HC and
constable Abid No.71 occupying the rear seat, had already
succumbed to the fire arm injuries sustained by them
during firing of the said unknown accused.

3 The learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Kohat
Division, Kohat, admitted the accused/respondents to bail,
mainly, on the grounds that although the complainant/SI
had mentioned in the FIR that he could identify two armed
persons if brought before him but there was no
identification parade conducted by the I.O; and that the
occurrence had taken place at 2125 hours of night and
further that the accused/respondents had been charged after
delay of about 13/14 days. Moreover, according to the
learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, the
accused/respondents had remained in police custody for
sufficient period of time but neither they made confession
before any Court of law, nor anything was brought on the
record that the accused/respondents and deceased police
officials had any previous enmity or ill will, thus making
case against the accused/respondents that of further

inquiry.
4. The learned AAG, during the course of his
arguments, could only refer to recovery of a large
number of crime empties from the spot during spot
inspection by the I.O and also a positive report by the
firearms expert about these empties and the weapons
of offence recovered on the pointation of the
accused/respondents, besides CDR data of the cell
phones of the accused/respondents; but it needs be
stressed here that the above referred material made
available during investigation formed part of
corroborative evidence and could not be regarded as
substitute for direct incriminating ocular and
circumstantial evidence which was, indeed, lacking in
the case, as neither the accused/respondents were
charged in the FIR nor there was independent eye
witness account of the occurrence, and the
accused/respondents were also not identified in a
properly conducted identification parade by the
complainant/SI who claimed to have identified two of
the unknown accused in the headlights of the vehicle.
In the circumstances, there could be no escape from
the conclusion arrived at by the learned Judge, Anti
Terrorism Court, Kohat, that the case against the
accused/respondents was subject to further inquiry.

5. As such, the bail granting order of the

learned Judge, Anti Terrorism Court, Kohat, does not
warrant interference by this Court; therefore, the bail
cancellation application is accordingly dismissed in
limine.
