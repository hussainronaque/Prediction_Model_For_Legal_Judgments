Hegal gateway exchange through

PTOL, EVO, 3e Wingle wireless USB cevice in the
suburbs of Peshawar City, without any license fron

the concerned government authorities, making it

vuinerable to ss used for criminal activities, initially,

accused/petiioner, Muhammad Usman, was

suspected as the main culprit, involved in the

business, anc also in using pre-activaied illegal

, the names and CNIC particulars

SIMs activate
of different xeonle across Pakistan; and the
accused/netitioner was intercepted in the Daewco

Bus Terminal, Pashawar, and during searcn of his

re-activated SiVis, one PTCL EVO 3G Wvingle

o

wireless USE device and one Laptop were
recovered. Likewise, 14 pre-activated SIs were
shown to nave een recovered from the personal
search of hic companion namely Muharnmad

resident of Rawalpindi. The

Jaccused/petiiioners were, therefore, arrested on the

Peshawar mign Count,

charges of causing heavy loss to the Nationa

eExchecuer and establishing parallel communication

activities without any license

petitioners have approached this

£

Court for their release on bail, mainly, on the
grounds of serious illness of accused/petitioner,
Muhammad Usman, lack of direct and
circumstantial evidence to connect the

with the commission of the

offence and non-verification of the recovered Si
cards Tne learned counsel for the

further contended that

ounishment cribed for offences under both

sections of ‘sw did not exceed 07 years
imprisonment, thus falling outside the prohibitory
clause contained in Section 497 CrPC. The learried
counsel also contended that imposition of fine was

prescribed as in alternate punishment, therefore,

confinement of che accused/petitioners in Jail when

ihere is possibiity of imposition of only fine as a
punishment in case of proof of charge against the

2c 04.03.2015 in bail petition titked

P/207 Sand also a :nother judgment reported as 207+

arnea counsel! for the state, on the
other hand, focused his arguments on the prevailing
law and order situation in the country, and roije
played by the recovered equipments in facilitation of

such crimes,

fom One cannot remain oblivious to the
precarious law end order situation in the country,

liberty of the citizens cannot be

eresumptions and conjunctures
that the recovered equipments might have
contributed to the escalation of the already
dangerous situation if used for fulfillment of the
sinister objects by some unscrupulous elements out
to destroy peave and tranquility in the country;
especially when the allegations of the prosecution in
the FIR centers on heavy loss to the National
Exchequer end establishment of parallel
communication system for criminal activities without
any license. Needless to say that no evidence is

orthcoming, pima facie substantiating either of the
llegations, 2s even forensic report has not been

eceived so far, proving the equipments to be in

—— condition, neither recovered SIM cards

have yet been verified. All this is bound to make
case of the accused/petitioners that of further
inquiry.

3. Moreover, the offences with which the
accused/peiiiicners have been charged under both
sections of law carry maximum penalty of 07 years,
thus falling outside the ambit of prohibitory clause
contained in Section 497 Cr.PC. The provision with
regard to imposition of fine as an alternate
punishment would also make the

accused/petilioners entitled to bail, as in case of
4

refusal of bail ic them and sending them behind the

bars for an indefisHe period may amount to double

jeonardy, in case only fine is imposed on them as a
punishment on conclusion of trial and proof of case
against them.

7. In any case, investigation in the case is
complete, as cornolete challan has been submitted
on 02.03.2015, implying thereby that the
accused/petitioners are no longer required to the

prosecution/police for the purpose of investigation.

8. Consequently, on the acceptance of the

appication, wh the accused/petitioners are

admitted to | in the case, subject to their
furnishing bail bords in the sum of Rs. 2, 00,000/-
(two lacs) each with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the concerned

Macistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are

local, reliable anc persons of means.
