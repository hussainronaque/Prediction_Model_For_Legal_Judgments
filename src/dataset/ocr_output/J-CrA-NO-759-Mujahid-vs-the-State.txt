2. Through the instant Jail Criminal Appeal, the

appellant-convict has questioned his conviction and
sentences, whereas, the learned trial Court has sent Murder
Reference No.17-P/2019 for confirmation of death sentence
of the convict.

3. As the matters are emanating from one and the same
judgment dated 25.05.2019 of the learned trial Court,
therefore, we propose to decide the same through this single
judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in the First
Information Report (FIR) Exh.PA is that on 09.12.2014, on
receipt of information regarding presence of dead bodies of
two unknown persons in the fields of Yar Ali Khan, situated
at the bank of river Indus, Noor-ul-Islam SI (PW.6) along
with other police officials reached the spot, where he
noticed dead bodies of two young unknown persons done to
death with firearms. He drafted Murasila Exh.PA/1,
wherein he mentioned detailed features of the two deceased

and sent the same to Police Station, on the basis of which,
3

FIR No.482 dated 09.12.2014 (Exh.PA) was registered in
Police Station Lahor District Swabi against unknown
culprit(s). Noor-ul-Islam SI (PW.6), also took into
possession a motorcycle parked near the dead bodies vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.6/1, prepared injury sheets and
inquest reports of the deceased and obtained fingers prints
of the deceased vide Exh.PW.6/3. Muhammad Ilyas and
Aqil Muhammad (fathers of the two deceased) identified
the dead bodies, he prepared identification memo
Exh.PW.6/4 and sent the dead bodies RHC Kunda for
autopsy under the escort of Ishtiaq FC, where Dr. Mubazir
Ahmad (PW.1) conducted post mortem, reports of which is
Exh.PM and Exh.PM/1 and opined the cause of death of the
two deceased to be result of firearm injuries.

5. The task of investigation was entrusted to Aurangzeb
Khan SI (PW.7), who proceeded to the spot and prepared
site plan Exh.PB at the instant of Noor-ul-Islam Khan S.I.
During spot inspection, he secured bloodstained earth and
grass from the places of the deceased through recovery
memos Exh.PW.7/1 and Exh.PW.7/2, respectively and also
took into possession 06 empties of 30 bore Exh.P.8 and
Exh.P.9, lying in scattered position at the spot vide recovery
memos Exh.PW.7/3 and Exh.PW.7/4. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.7/5, he took into possession the last worn

bloodstained garments of the two deceased, sent the
4
bloodstained articles to the FSL for analysis. The appellant
was arrested by relatives of the deceased Suleman and
handed over to Zahid SHO on 15.11.2014 vide arrest card
Exh.PW.7/14. PW.7 obtained police custody of the
appellant, interrogated him and recorded his statement
under section 161 Cr.P.C.

On 16.11.2014, statement of Yaqoob Khan (father of
deceased Suleman) got recorded by the learned Illaqa
Judicial Magistrate under section 164 Cr.P.C. wherein he
charged the appellant for commission of the offence. On the
alleged pointation of the appellant, the I.O. recovered .30
bore crime pistol along with 15 live rounds of the same bore
and a spare charger Exh.P.10 from a hay dump situated in
the landed property of one Shah Rasool. Similarly, a mobile
Nokia set and cash amount of Rs.1,19,000/- consisting of
107 currency notes were also recovered on the pointation of
the appellant from the said hay dump. The I.0. (PW.7)
prepared pointation memo Exh.PW.7/19, sent the pistol
along with six empties of 30 bore to the FSL for analysis,
prepared identification memo Exh.PW.7/23 vide which
Yaqoob Khan father of Suleman deceased identified the
amount of Rs.1,19,000/-, and nokia mobile set recovered on
the pointation of the appellant. He placed on file the
positive Serologist report Exh.PK, recorded statements of

the PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. and after completion of
5
investigation handed over case file to the SHO, who
submitted complete challan against the appellant.
6. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was summoned and formally charge sheeted to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as ten
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. He, however, neither wished to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to
produce evidence in defense. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court, after hearing both the sides convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above, hence, this
appeal and murder reference.
7. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.
8. It appears from record that it is a case of no
eyewitness because no one has come forward to furnish
ocular account of the occurrence. As per Murasila
Exh.PA/1, the dead bodies of Suleman and Abbas deceased
were lying at the bank of Indus river in the fields of Yar Ali
Khan which were shifted by Noor-ul-Islam S.I. (PW.6) to
RHC Kunda on 09.12.2014. On the same day, Yaqoob

Khan and Aqil Khan, fathers of deceased Suleman and
6

Abbas, respectively, identified the dead bodies before the
police. Site plan Exh.PB totally negates the version of
Noor-ul-Islam SI (PW.6) and contradicts the place of
occurrence shown in the Murasila Exh.PA/1. In the latter
document, the place of occurrence is shown as “Kinara
Daryay-e-Sindh Arazi Yar Ali Khan” (river bank of Indus)
whereas in the site plan Exh.PB, prepared by the I.O. on the
pointation of Noor-ul-Islam (PW.6), the crime scene has
been shown in the courtyard of Rest House of Yar Ali
Khan, situated near Indus River. Said Yar Ali Khan was an
important witness to explain about visit of the deceased to
his rest house and events occurred on the day of occurrence,
but he has neither been made as an accused nor examined
by the I.O. under section 161 Cr.P.C. nor cited as a
prosecution witness. The above circumstances create
serious doubt about the place of occurrence.

9. Further evidence relied upon by the prosecution is the
testimony of Yaqoob Khan, father of Suleman deceased
(PW.4), recovery of .30 bore pistol, Nokia mobile set and
Rs.1,19000/- on the pointation of the appellant as well as
positive FSL report in respect of the pistol and 06 empties
recovered from the spot.

10. | Yaqoob Khan while appearing as PW.4 reiterated the
version set forth by him in his statement under section 164

Cr.P.C. i.e. that he along with his son Suleman deceased
7
was running Arms and ammunition shop at Jehangira
Bazaar. A month prior to the occurrence, appellant
Mujahid, visited their shop and offered ten number of .30
bore pistols for sale, which were purchased from him by
Suleman deceased. The appellant gradually developed
relation with them. On the day of occurrence i.e.
09.12.2014, early in the morning, the appellant visited their
shop and told Suleman deceased that he has some arms
which he wants to hand over to him. At 10 A.M Suleman
deceased along with his brother-in-law Abbas deceased
took Rs.2.50,000/- with them and left the shop on a
motorcycle 70 CC to meet the appellant, however, they did
not return home till evening. He started search for them and
also tried on their cell numbers to contact them but in vain.
After evening, one Amjad son of Gul Rehman came and
told him that the local police have shifted dead bodies of
two persons to RHC Kunda. On this, he along with Aqil
Muhammad (father of Abbas deceased) proceeded to PS
Lahor and saw dead bodies of their sons and _ their
motorcycle in the Police Station. He charged the appellant
for murder of the deceased and forcibly snatching
Rs.2,50,000/- from the deceased. He stated that on
22.12.2014, he identified cash amount of Rs.1,19,000/- and
Nokia mobile of Suleman deceased recovered by the police

on the discovery of the appellant from a hay dump.
8
11. Before adverting to cross-examination of PW
Yaqoob Khan, we would refer to arrest card of the appellant
(Exh.PW.7/14) wherein his arrest has been shown on
15.12.2014. According to statements of Yaqoob Khan
(PW.4) and Muhammad Zahid (PW.3), the appellant was
arrested by relatives of Suleman deceased at Jehangira
Chowk within the jurisdiction of District Nowshera and
then shifted to Swabi and handed over to Zahid Khan SHO
Swabi. The factum of arrest of the appellant by relatives of
deceased Suleman is also established from record. The
relatives of the deceased who arrested the appellant have
neither been examined by the I.O. nor cited as prosecution
witnesses. Statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. of Yaqoob Khan
(PW.4) was recorded on 16.12.2014 i.e. on the next day of
arrest of the appellant. Fact as to how and on the basis of
which sources and circumstances relatives of the deceased
got satisfied themselves about complicity of the appellant in
the commission of offence has neither been explained by
PW Yagqoob Khan nor by the Investigating Officer nor by
Muhammad Zahid (PW.3). The story narrated by the PW
Yqoob Khan in his statement has never been disclosed by
him before the police on the very first day of the occurrence
when he identified the dead body of his deceased son or
since 09.12.2014 (the date of occurrence) till 16.12.2014

(the date of arrest of the appellant). If he was in the
9
knowledge of all events alleged by him in his statement
under section 164 Cr.P.C, recorded after arrest of the
appellant, he could have easily disclosed the same before
the police on the very first day of the occurrence or at least
he could mention before the police that on the eventful day
the two deceased left shop along with cash amount to meet
the appellant for the purpose of purchasing arms from him.
Yet there is another thing which pinches a prudent mind
about the belated version of PW Yaqoob Khan i.e. if the
appellant could bring ten pistols to his shop prior to the
occurrence for sale then what was the reason which
prompted him to call the deceased for selling arms to him at
another place. In cross-examination PW Yaqoob Khan
deposed that he has not produced any witness regarding last
seen of the deceased in the company of the appellant. He
also denied recording of his statement under section 161
Cr.P.C. and statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. recorded by the
Judicial Magistrate. He admitted that appellant was
overpowered by his relatives in Jehangira Bazaar and
handed over to the local police on 09.12.2014, which
negates the arrest card of the appellant wherein arrest of the
appellant has been shown on 15.12.2014. As per statement
of Yaqoob khan he along with the father of deceased Abbas
arrived at police station Lahore, where they saw the dead

body of their sons and motorcycle. Perusal of inquest report
10

and postmortem report show that the corpse of both the
deceased had not been identified by any person. It suggests
that the PW Yaqoob Khan has never been to Police Station
Lahore as no one was available as identifier at RHC Kunda,
Swabi. The belated uncorroborated testimony of PW
Yaqoob Khan seems to be a cook and bull story in which he
has tried to implicate the appellant for commission of the
offence for the reason best known to him. In this view of
the matter, the learned trial Court has landed into the field
of error by believing and relying upon the testimony of PW
Yaqoob Khan for the purpose of conviction.

12. As regards positive FSL report in respect of 06
empties of 30 bore, shown recovered from the spot and
30 bore pistol, Nokia mobile set and Rs1,19000/- in cash,
shown recovered on the pointation/discovery of the
appellant from a hay dump (Bosarra), one may easily
observe that the said hay dump (Bosara), has been shown
situated in the fields of one Shah Rasool. The said Shah
Rasool has neither been cited as a witness to the recovery
proceedings nor his statement with regard to existence of
the hay dump (Bosarra) hasbeen recorded to substantiate
that the alleged Bossara was his ownership and whether it
was open and in use or sealed (not yet opened). Similarly
the I.O. has also not clarified in the pointation memo as to

whether the hay dump was open (in use) or sealed. Even
11

otherwise, cash amount and mobile set which can easily be
accommodated and adjusted in pockets, its concealment in
a hay dump of a stranger does not appeal to a prudent mind.
Besides, the place of alleged discovery is situated in an
open field, surrounded by fields of different people, hence,
easily approachable; therefore, it would not be safe that
such piece of evidence be made a basis for conviction of an
accused in a capital charge, that too, in a case of no ocular
account. The testimony of Noor ul Islam SI (PW.6), who
reached the spot at first instance, totally shatters the
evidentiary value of the alleged crime empties. In cross-
examination, he deposed that he had not seen any empty
shell in the surroundings of the spot. In this view of the
matter, recovery of 06 empties by the I.0., who visited the
spot at 6.00 A.M. in the month of December, when there
remains complete dark at such time, seems to be planted
and maneuvered evidence.

13. Yet there is another crucial aspect of the prosecution
case that the 06 crime empties have been shown recovered
from the spot on 09.12.2014, but were sent to the FSL on
23.12.2014 along with the 30 bore pistol shown recovered
on the pointation of the appellant on 17.12.2014. Where the
empties remained since 09.12.2014 till 23.12.2014 and
whether these were in safe hands, has not been explained by

the prosecution in its evidence. Similarly, no explanation
12

has been furnished by the prosecution regarding safe
custody of the pistol since 17.12.2014 till its sending to the
FSL on 23.12.2014. It is asserted in the evidence that PW
Yaqoob Khan is running arms and ammunitions shop,
therefore, the possibility remains that the pistol and empties
might have been provided by PW Yaqoob Khan to the
police and thereafter were sent together to FSL for analysis,
report of which definitely be positive.

14. The matter of evidentiary value of the empties sent to
the FSL with delay came up before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case titled, “Jehangir_vs Nazar Farid and

another” (2002 SCMR_1986) wherein it was observed as

under:-
“Accused was arrested on 01.02.1996, crime
weapon was allegedly recovered from the
accused on 12.02.19965 and the crime
empties were received in the Laboratory on
19.02.1996. Such piece of evidence was not
credible and was of no assistance to the
prosecution against the accused in
circumstances.”

Similarly, in case titled, “Hamid Nadeem vs _ the State”

(2011 SCMR 1233), the Hon’ble Supreme Court has ruled

that:-
13

“The crime weapon (pistol) which was

recovered from the applicant on 08.07.2001

was handed over to PW.13 Kaleemullah

Constable which he deposited in the office

of FSL on 16.07.2001 and strangely, that

too, with five live bullets for reasons best

known to him. As stated above, the delay

and safe custody has also not been

explained. Report of FSL, in circumstances,

loses sanctity especially in a case, with a

capital charge, where abundant precaution is

urgently required for safe administration of

justice.”
15. Deriving guidance from the judgments (supra) of the
Hon’ble Supreme and placing reliance thereupon, we are
firm in our view to hold that this piece of evidence has no
evidentiary value, therefore, has wrongly been relied upon
by the learned trial Court.
16. Muhammad Yqoob (PW.4), in his statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C., has neither given any description and
features of Nokia mobile set of his deceased son nor has
disclosed about denomination of the currency worth
Rs.2,50,000/- allegedly taken by deceased Suleman to
purchase arms from the appellant. In cross-examination he

admitted that he has not brought any evidence that his son
14
took Rs.2,50,000/- with him. Further deposed that the
motorcycle recovered from the spot was without number
and he has not given any registration of the same to the
police. That he identified the Nokia set and cash amount on
22.12.2014, however, no other mobiles or currency notes
were placed with the recovered one at the time of
identification. In this view of the matter, it would be unsafe
to rely on such weak piece of evidence for sustaining
conviction in a capital charge.

17. For what has been discussed above, on reappraisal of
evidence, we have reached to an irresistible conclusion that
it is a case of no ocular account and the circumstantial
evidence brought on record by no stretch imagination is
sufficient to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond shadow
of reasonable doubt. The prosecution evidence is shaky and
scanty as well as pregnant with doubts. It is settled law that
prosecution is duty bound to prove its case beyond any
reasonable doubt and if any single doubt is created, benefit
of the same must got to the accused and entitled him for
earning acquittal as the accused is always considered the
most favorable child of law. Guidance in this regard can be
derived from case titled, “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State”
(1995 SCMR 1345) and case titled, “Muhammad Akram
Vs the State (2009 SCMR 230) and Faryad Alis 20 case

(2008 SCMR 1086).
15
18. The learned Trial Court has failed to appreciate the
evidence in its true perspective and has arrived at an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence; hence, the impugned judgment is liable to be set
aside.
19. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed. Conviction and
sentences of the appellant recorded by the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated 25.05.2019 along with the
judgment are hereby set aside and the appellant is acquitted
from the charge leveled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not confined in any other case. On acquittal of
the appellant, Murder Reference, sent by the learned trial
Court is answered in the Negative.
20. These are the reasons of our short order of even date
which is reproduced below:-

“For reasons to be recorded later, we, allow
this appeal, set-aside the conviction and
sentence of the appellant-convict, namely,
Mujahid son of Hikmat Khan, recorded
under section 302 (b) by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II/Camp Court Lahor, Swabi
vide judgment dated 25.05.2019, in case FIR
No.482 dated 09.12.2014, registered under
sections 302/440 PPC read with section 15-
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 at
Police Station Lahor District Swabi and
hereby acquit him from the charge leveled

against him in the cited case. He be set at
16

liberty forthwith, if not confined in any other
case.

On acquittal of the appellant-
convict, Murder Reference No.17-P/2019,
sent by the learned Trial Court in terms of
section 374 Cr.P.C., is answered in the

Negative.
