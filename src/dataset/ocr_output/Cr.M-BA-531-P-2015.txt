QALANDAR_ ALI KHAN, _J:- The

petitioner, Haroon, is seeking post arrest
bail in case FIR No.134 dated 30.1.2015

under Sections 365-B/498-B/34 PPC,

BZ. Police Station Bana Mari, Peshawar, which

/ Was registered on the report of Mst.Rabia,

f

a complainant-respondent No.2, wherein she
ao 4

a charged the accused/petitioner along with
co-accused, namely, Abbas Khan, Tahir and
Mst. Khialai for her kidnapping/abduction
and forcing her to enter in-to ‘Nikah’ with
accused/petitioner, who also subjected her

to sexual intercourse for five months. In

her report, complainant alleged that co-

accused Mst. Khialai used to reside in
Mohallah New Dabgari in their
neighbourhood and was on visiting terms
with her family, and continued to visit
them in the peoples colony after they had
shifted to the latter place around seven
months ago. Complainant further alleged
that when she was all alone at home five
months before lodging the report on
28.01.2015, Mst. Khialai visited her and
took her along on the pretext of taking her
ZA 3g young child to hospital, but in the

car parked out side the house three sons

of Mst. Khialai including the

accused/petitioner and co-accused Abbas
and Tahir were sitting and they forceably
made her to sit in the car and also made
her unconscious through some intoxicant
substance. According to the complainant,
she found herself in another house on

oo regaining senses, where she was forceably
—_ made to sign a paper which later turned

out as ‘Nikahnama’ with the

accused/petitioner. The complainant
charged the accused/petitioner for sexual
intercourse for five months during which
she was kept in confinement in a room
locked from outside. The complainant
claimed that one day prior to lodging of
the report i.e 27.1.2015, she found door of
the room open and thus managed to flee
the house and reached home where she
narrated the occurrence to her family
members who advised her to lodge report
in the Police Station.

3, During investigation, the
complainant was medically examined,
showing her probable age as 18-20 years,
as against age of complainant shown in
the FIR by her as 14 years. Moreover, no
sign of violence or struggle was found on
the body of the complainant. The
accused/petitioner was arrested on the
same date i.e 30.1.2015 when case was
registered in the Police Station. However,

the remaining three accused named in the
4

‘ FIR are still at large, and after proceedings
under Sections 204 and 87 Cr.PC, challan
has been submitted against them under
Section 512 Cr.PC, at the time of
submission of complete challan against the

accused/petitioner.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
the accused/petitioner, learned AAG
assisted by learned counsel for
complainant/respondent No.2 heard, and
, record perused.

ws Mr.Hussain Ali, Advocate, learned

oo
counsel for the accused/petitioner, argued

that there was inordinate delay in lodging
the FIR by the complainant, who had
wrongly given her age as 14 years in the
FIR, though she was grown up and aged
about 18 to 20 years, according to the
medical report. The learned counsel also
referred to ‘Nikahnama’ executed at the

time of ‘Nikah’ of the complainant with the

accused/petitioner on 09.06.2014, and

also affidavit on behalf of the complainant
whereby the ‘Nikah’ was further re-
inforced. Learned counsel pointed out that

one day before lodging of report by the
complainant, the accused/petitioner had
lodged a report in Police Station Shah-
Qabool recorded at Sr. No.8 of the Daily
Diary dated 27.1.2015, wherein the
accused/petitioner had complained about
desertion of the complainant and her
leaving his house because of strained
a relations with him while taking away cash
mount of Rs.500000/- and 10 ‘tola’ gold.
The learned counsel further pointed out
Cc) that the complainant had also lodged a
suit for dissolution of marriage on the
ground of cruelty and recovery of dower
amounting to Rs.100000/- and 3 ‘tola’ gold
ornaments. Learned counsel stressed that
case of the accused/petitioner would,
therefore, fall within the ambit of further
inquiry, in the light of judgments in cases
reported as 2012 MLD 1958 (Lahore) and

2003 P.Cr.LJ 825 (Karachi).

6. The learned AAG assisted by Mr.
Abdul Latif Khan Afridi, Advocate, learned
counsel for complainant/respondent No.2,
opposed grant of bail to the
accused/petitioner, inter alia, on the
grounds that a young girl of tender age
has been subjected to forced ‘Nikah’ and
sexual intercourse by the
accused/petitioner with help and active

support of absconding co-accused after her

__ kidnapping/abduction with sinister design

/ of forcing her ‘Nikah’ with the

/
=) accused/petitioner against her free well, as

is evident from her report to the police
after complainant managed to flee the
place where she was kept in_ illegal
confinement and subjected to inhuman
acts. Learned counsel for
complainant/respondent No.2 vehemently
contended that no parents in our society
would so readily accept the stigma of
kidnapping/abduction of their young

unmarried daughter unless they have

exhausted all their remedies to confirm
themselves about the commission of such
heinous crime by the perpetrators. The
learned counsel urged that report of the
complainant is a glaring proof of the fact
that she was not a consenting party to the
‘Niakh’, and the ‘Nikah-Nama’ and all other
documents in support of ‘Nikah-Nama’
were obtained through force and coercion.
In order to defend delay in lodging the

report, the learned counsel placed reliance

‘Yon PLD 2007 SC 71 and 2014 MLD 1311
af

(Sindh).

7. Admittedly, the FIR has been lodged
after inordinate delay of five months by
the complainant alleging therein her
kidnapping/abduction by the
accused/petitioner and co-accused. On a
query, it was disclosed that both the
parents of the complainant are still alive,
and brother of the complainant is pursuing
the case on her behalf; but, intriguingly,

neither parents of the complainant lodged
report despite her dis-appearance and
remaining untraceable for five months nor
even the report was lodged by them or
brother of the complainant when she
reached home and informed her family
members about the occurrence. This
aspect of the case remained unexplained
that if family honour was the only factor
restraining parents and_ other family
» members of the complainant from lodging

ithe report, what was the reason for

a

a> sending the complainant all alone to the
“ 4 Police Station for lodging the report. All
ed
these facts are yet to be probed into, thus
making case that of further inquiry.
8. Besides, the ‘Nikah Nama’ coupled
with affidavit on behalf of complainant and
statements under Section 161 Cr.PC of two
‘Nikah’ witnesses namely Ghulam
Muhammad and Jehanzeb Khan,
supporting ‘Niakh’, together with report of

the accused/petitioner in Police Station

Shahgabool on  27.1.2015 showing

desertion of the complainant owing to
strained relations while taking away cash
amount of Rs.500000/- and 10 ‘Tola’ gold
would further make case of the
kidnapping/abduction against the
accused/petitioner that of further inquiry.

9. Furthermore, neither absconsion of
the co-accused can have any bearing on
the case of the accused/petitioner nor the

judgments cited at the bar by the learned

}
ZA counsel for complainant/respondent No.2

_2 would be attracted to the instant case, as
—

judgment in the case reported as PLD
2007 SC 71 is not applicable to the facts of
this case for the simple reason that the
cited case related to kidnapping for
ransom. Likewise, 2014 MLD 1311 (Sindh)
has no application to the facts and
circumstances of the instant case, as each
and every criminal case has its peculiar
facts and circumstances which are to be
taken into consideration for the purpose of

bail. The facts and _ circumstances
, 8 distinguishing this case from other cases
involving delay have, rather, been
explained above.

10. In short, case of the
accused/petitioner squarely falls within the
category of a case of further inquiry;
therefore, on acceptance of the
application, the accused/petitioner is
admitted to bail subject to his furnishing
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100000/- with
two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of  Ilaqa/Duty Judicial

Magistrate.
