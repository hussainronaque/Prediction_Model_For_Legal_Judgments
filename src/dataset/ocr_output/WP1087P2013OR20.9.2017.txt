JUDGMENT SHEET

PESHAWAR HIGH COURT,
PESHAWAR. .

(Judicial Department)

W.P No.1087-P/2013 with I.R.

IJAZ ANWAR, J.- Petitioner through the instant

writ petition has prayed that the office order/ letter No.
2214/ACE, dated 28.3.2013 issued by respondent No.2 be
declared as illegal, unreasonable and uncalled for and
respondents No.1 to 3 be restrained from taking or
demanding original mortgage/loan documents from the
petitioner-bank.

2. . Background of the case is that the petitioner
is Banking Company, incorporated under the Banking
Companies Ordinance, 1962, while the respondent No.4 is
a public limited company, incorporated and registered
under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. The latter had
availed various finance facilities in the form of running
finance, letter of credit and finance against trust receipts

from the former. It was in the year, 2007 when dispute

arose between the parties and respondent No.4 filed a suit
No. 02/2007 before the Banking Judge of this Court,
against the petitioner for rendition of account but since the
substantial amount of the aforesaid finance facilities was
unpaid, therefore, the latter also filed a recovery suit
No.01/2008. Since both the parties, i.e., the bank and the
loanee/customer, had filed suits against the same subject
matter, therefore, the same were consolidated. During
pendency of the suits, respondent No.5 submitted an
application before the police which was forwarded to the
Director, Anti Corruption Establishment, Peshawar, for
enquiry under section 156(3) Cr. P.C and it was on
28.4.2013 when respondent No.2, Assistant Director
(Revenue) Anti-Corruption Establishment, Peshawar,
issued. a letter No. 2214/ACE to the petitioner-Bank to |

provide original mortgage deed, which, according to the

, petitioner, is nothing but to protect the matter pending

before the Banking Judge of this Court as the question of ©
genuineness or otherwise of the mortgage deed is
sub judice before the Judge, Banking Court, hence, the
present writ petition.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that
approach of respondent No. 5 to respondents No. 1 to 3 for

initiation of criminal proceedings against the petitioner is
based on mala fide and ulterior motive. He next argued
that both the parties have filed their suits regarding the
same subject matter and the Banking Judge of this Court,
after consolidating both the suits, framed a specific issue
regarding the mortgage deed. He further argued that the
Provincial Anti-Corruption Establishment has got no
jurisdiction to interfere in the banking matters as the
petitioner is neither Govt. Bank nor its officers can be
termed as public servant within the meaning of Section 21
of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. Learned counsel argued
that the issue regarding the authenticity of the mortgage
deed is sub judice. before the Banking Judge of this court,
therefore, the criminal liability is dependent upon the
result of the civil litigation, hence, the action of the Anti-
Corruption Establishment requires to be put on hold till
the outcome of the suit. Learned counsel placed reliance :
‘on the cases of Muhammad Akbar vs the State__ (1968
Ne 281 ), Abdl Haleem Vs. The State and others ( 1982
SCMR 988) and Mst. Kausar Zafar Ullah and another
ys. the State and others ( 2013 P Cr. L J, Peshawar,
301),

4. Conversely, learned counsel for the
respondents 6 to 12 argued that the original mortgage deed

is not in possession of the petitioner and only certain
documents have been demanded by the Anti Corruption
Establishment, therefore, it cannot be questioned. He next
argued that both, criminal and civil proceedings, can go
simultaneously, therefore, this petition being based on
mala fide may be dismissed, while learned counsel for the
respondents 4 and 5 argued that since the petitioner has
other alternate remedies by approaching to the Magistrate,
therefore, the writ petition is not maintainable. They

placed reliance on the cases of Muhammad _ Tufail Ys.

The State and another (1979 SCMR 437),_A. Habib
Ahmad vs. M.K. G Scott Christain and 5 others (PLD
1992 S.C 353), Akhlag Hussain Kayani vs. Zafar Iqbal
Kiyani_and others (2010 SCMR_ 1835), and Riaz ul
Haq vs. Muhammad Ashig Jorah and others (2000
SCMR 991),

5. We have gone through the available record
and considered the submissions made by learned counsel
for the parties. |

6. Perusal of the record reveals that respondent
No:4 being a public limited company availed different
finance facilities in the form of running finance, letter of

credit and finance against trust receipts from the petitioner.

Subsequently, dispute arose between the parties as a result of

‘ which the former filed a suit bearing No. 02/2007 for
rendition of account while the latter filed suit No.01/2008 for
recovery ‘of the outstanding amount before the Banking
Judge of this Court. Since both the suites were regarding the
same subject matter, therefore, the same were consolidated
and, thereafter, consolidated issues were framed including
the issue with regard to the disputed mortgage at S. No.8,
which is reproduced as under:- |

“Whether the property at Serial No.9 of paragraph
4 of plaint in Suit No. 1/2000 has been correctly and
legally mortgaged in favour of ABL? OPP

The record further speaks that an interim: decree
amounting to Rs. 27.180 Million under section 11 of the
Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance,
2001, has been passed in favour of the petitioner-Allied
Bank, vide order dated 20.9.2010, while rest of the claim is
still pending adjudication before the Banking Judge of this
Court. We find that the impugned letter dated 28.3.2013
pertains to the transaction, the authenticity of which is
subjudice before the Banking Judge of this Court. In the said
letter, not only specifically certain questions were raised but
the original mortgage deed was sought to be provided. The

relevant paragraph of the letter reads as under:-
\>

“Beside the original mortgage deed may be
provided for verification of the signature/thumb
impression of mortgage and witnesses through
FSL Forensic Science laboratory.”

7. ‘There is no cavil with the proposition that both,
civil and criminal proceedings, can go side by side and that
criminal proceedings should not be kept pending till decision
of civil litigation pending regarding the same subject matter,
but here the situation is entirely different. Allowing the Anti-
Corruption Establishment to proceed with the matter and
give certain findings about the disputed mortgage would
certainly affect the outcome of the civil suits pending before
the Banking Judge of this Court and thereby grave injustice
would be done to the parties. When civil suits are pending
adjudication Court, wherein regarding the authenticity of the
mortgage deed, a specific issue has been framed, therefore,
the question could be thoroughly thrashed out by the
Banking court. The august supreme court of Pakistan in the
case titled Muhammad Akbar vs The State (PLD 1968 S.C
281) hold that where it is clear that the criminal liability is

dependent upon the result of the civil litigation or is so

intimately connected with it that there is a danger of grave

injustice being done in the case if there be a conflict of
decision between the civil court and the criminal court then

in such event it is equally clear that the criminal court has not
only the right to but should also stay its hands until the civil
litigation is disposed of, for, it is not desirable that when the
title to the property itself is in dispute, the criminal courts
should give a finding in respect of the same question.

8. There is yet another important aspect of the
case. The petitioner is a purely a private bank and the
Provincial as well as the Federal Government has no share or
interest therein. The West Pakistan Anti-Corruption
Establishment Ordinance, 1961, is the ordinance to provide
for the constitution of a special agency for the investigation
of. certain offences relating to corruption by public servants.
The word “public servant” has been defined in the
Ordinance, ibid, which means a public servant as defined in
section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code, hence, the interference
in such a matter by the Provincial Anti-Corruption
Establishment is also questionable.

9. . For the above said reasons, we hold that since
civil litigations regarding the loan facility is pending
adjudication before the Banking Judge of this Court,
therefore, initiating criminal proceedings simultaneously
would definitely affect the result of the civil litigations,
particularly, when (the validity of the mortgage) is in dispute.

Therefore, this writ petition is accepted and the inquiry
initiated on the complainant of respondents shall remain

suspended till the final decision of the suits.
