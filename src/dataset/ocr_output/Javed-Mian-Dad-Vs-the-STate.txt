JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Javed Mian Dad alias Javed, seeks

bail in case FIR No.416 dated 17.06.2015,

registered under sections 302/34 PPC, in Police

Station Urmar, District Peshawar, wherein he

alongwith co-accused Muhammad Irfan, is

charged for committing the murder of Kamran

Shah deceased.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. Though complainant has charged the

petitioner alongwith co-accused directly in the

FIR for committing the murder of his deceased

brother, by throwing him in a well, but neither

he nor anybody else has witnessed the incident.

The dead body of the deceased had been

recovered from a well known as “Chughal Zai

Baba Well” by the locals, in decomposed

condition but according to autopsy report, the

cause of death of the deceased is firearm injury

to his brain. Except positive FSL report qua a

single empty of 30 bore pistol recovered from

the crime venue and 30 bore pistol allegedly

recovered on the pointation of the petitioner,

which too, has been sent with a delay of more

than a month, there is no other substantial

evidence to connect the petitioner with the

commission of offence while the evidentiary

value of the above mentioned corroborative

piece of evidence is yet to be determined during

trial in light of other independent strong

circumstances of the incident. On tentative

assessment of the material available on record,

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

reasonable grounds exist which require further

probe into the guilt of the petitioner, hence, I am

inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in

favour of the petitioner.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided

he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa

Judicial Magistrate-MOD, concerned. The

sureties must be local, reliable and men of

means.
