FEI IC OGIO

LAL_JAN_KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 19.01.2019 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-!I / Judge Special Court
Takht Bhai delivered in case FIR No. 140
dated 04.04.2014 under Section 9 (c) of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997,
registered at Police Station Sher Garh
District Mardan, whereby the appellant has
been convicted and sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life with a fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- or in default whereof to suffer
further simple imprisonment of six (06)
months. Benefit under Section 382-B
Cr.P.C has been given to her.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
04.04.2014 complainant / SHO Fazal Sher
Khan (PW-3) received a spy information

that huge quantity of contraband will be
transported from Khyber Agency to Dargai,
Malakand Agency in motorcar bearing
Registration No. JMB-19. In order to foil the
bid, he arranged a Nakabandi on the spot.
In the meantime, police came across the
car, parked at Sher Garh Bazar, driver
whereof had left for purchase of some
commodities. The police party came nearer
to the spot and found three (03) persons
sitting in the car, who disclosed their names
as Mst. Farzana i.e. the appellant, Abid-ur-
Rehman and Murad while the name of their
absent co-accused was disclosed as
Shahid-ur-Rehman (All the three
absconders). On search of the vehicle two
plastic bags containing seven (07) and
eight (08) kilograms packets of chars were
recovered which were lying on floor of the
rear seat. On weighment, the contraband
turned out to be15000 grams. The Seizing
Officer separated 5 / 5 grams chars from
each packet for the purpose of chemical
analysis while rest of the contraband was
concealed in a separate parcel.

3. On completion of investigation,

challan was put in court, which indicted the
accused for the offence, to which she
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In
order to prove its case, prosecution
examined five (05) witnesses in all,
whereafter statement of the appellant was
recorded wherein she professed her
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found the appellant
guilty of the offence and while recording her
conviction, sentenced her as mentioned
above.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

5. Perusal of the case record would
show that there is no evidence on record to
show that who had sighted the vehicle
parked in the Bazaar of Sher Garh near the
bargain of motorbikes, who had searched
it, who had recovered contraband from the
floor of rear seat and who had opened the
packets of the contraband. Failure on part
of the prosecution to produce evidence to
the above aspects of the case has caused
cracks in its case, benefit of which must go
to the accused as it is a cardinal principle of

law that in order to bring home guilt to an
accused the prosecution is bound to prove
its case through worth reliable and
confidence inspiring evidence which is not
the case in hand. Besides, there is no
evidence that the Seizing Officer had
weighed each packet of the recovered
chars independently, which act, in the
considered opinion of this court, was must
as when more than one packets are
recovered then the prosecution must
weigh each packet independently.

6. Apart from the above, according to
the FIR, the time of occurrence has been
shown as 16:00 hours while the
complainant appearing in the witness box
has deposed that he had _ received
information about the transportation of
contraband at 01:15 hours whereas the
distance between the spot and Police
Station has been shown 700 / 800 meters
by PW-4, which could be covered hardly
within ten (10) minutes, moreso, when the
complainant himself stated that he was
having his own car and went to the spot in
it, thus, ibid aspect of the case has caused

dents in the prosecution case. Furthermore,
{s,

though the complainant received
information about the narcotics four hours
prior to the raid with the knowledge that the
culprits would be four (04) including a
female, but even then neither he could
obtain permission from the court nor
associated a lady constable with him.

7. No doubt, the appellant, as per the
prosecution case, was found sitting in the
car at the relevant time but there is no
material on the case file to show that she
had a conscious knowledge that the case
contraband was being smuggled in the car.
Mere sitting in a vehicle wherefrom some
contraband is recovered would not be
enough to hold the seater liable for
conviction unless it is shown by the
prosecution through reliable evidence that
she had conscious knowledge qua the
activity of smuggling which is not the case
in hand.

8. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not established and proved
its case against the appellant beyond any

shadow of doubt. The learned trial court
has not appreciated the case evidence in
its true perspective qua the appellant and
has fallen in legal error to record her
conviction, for which its judgment is not
sustainable.
9. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is accepted, the impugned
judgment to the extent of the appellant is
set-aside and she is acquitted of the charge
levelled against her. She be set at liberty
forthwith if not required to be detained in
any other case.

Above are the detailed reasons of

our short order of even date.
