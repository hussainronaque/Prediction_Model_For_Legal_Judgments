revenue at proper time, failing which he shall suffer six

benefit of section 382-B Cr.PC.

2. Murder reference has also been put up before us

for confirmation.

3. The story of prosecution as disclosed in the F.I.R

may briefly be narrated as follows:

On 05.10.2015 at 1500 hours Abdul Wahab
(PW-8), the complainant brought the dead-body of deceased
Abdul Nawab to Civil Hospital, Karak and made a report to

Umer Ayaz HC (PW-3) to the effect that:

4. After writing report of the complainant, it was
read over and explained to him, who after admitting it to be
correct thumb impressed the same in token of its correctness,
and his brother Munawar Shah signed the same as rider,
whereafter, Umer Ayaz, HC prepared the injury sheet and
inquest report in respect of the deceased and thereafter
referred the dead-body for post mortem examination under
the escort of Taimur and the murasila Ex:PA was sent to the
police station through constable, Hazrat Imam. The contents
of murasila were culminated in to F.IL.R No.519 dated

05.10.2015 under section 302 P.P.C, in Police Station Karak.

5. Copy of F.I.R was handed over to Noor Sali,

Sub Inspector for investigation, who on reaching at the spot,

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-4-

prepared site plan (Ex:PB) at the instance of complainant/ eye

witness; recorded statements of prosecution witnesses under

section 161 Cr.PC; conducted house search of the accused;

took into possession blood stained garments of the deceased

alongwith P.M documents vide recovery memo Ex:PC;

placed on file F.S.L report. Muhammad Riaz S.H.O, Police

Station Karak, arrested the accused on 06.10.2015 with .30

bore pistol bearing No.1845 alongwith fixed charger and a

bandolier containing seven rounds of the same bore and

registered a separate case under section 15 AA. During

interrogation under section 161 accused admitted his guilt

and let the police party to the place of occurrence and pointed

out various places as mentioned in the site plan and I.O

prepared pointation memo to this effect. He was presented

before the learned area Magistrate for recording his

confessional statement, but he refused and was remanded to

judicial lock-up. On completion of investigation complete

challan was submitted against him for trial. The convict/

appellant was summoned, delivered copies in compliance

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
with provision of section 265-C Cr.PC and was formally

charge sheeted, to which he did not plead guilty and claimed

trial. The prosecution in order to prove its case produced as

many as eleven (11) witnesses. On conclusion of prosecution

evidence, statement of convict/ appellant was recorded under

section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he professed his innocence,

however, he did not wish to produce defence evidence nor

opted to be examined on oath as required under section 342

(2) Cr.PC. Learned trial court after hearing arguments of

learned counsel for the parties, vide impugned judgment

dated 03.07.2017 convicted the appellant, as mentioned

above. Hence, this criminal appeal.

6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of convict/

accused argued that as per complainant many persons

witnessed the occurrence, but no private person came forward

as eye witness of the occurrence, except the complainant,

who may give his independent statement. He next argued that

the convict/ appellant surrendered before the police and the

pistol was recovered from his house, but a false story has

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-6-

been incorporated by the local police with the connivance of

complainant and thereby charged under section 15 AA in

separate F.I.R No.528. He went on to say that prosecution has

failed to connect the said pistol, as crime weapon. He

developed his arguments by saying that accused has been

shown in the site plan at a close distance, but as per medical

evidence no charring marks were found on the body of

deceased. He strengthened his previous argument by saying

that no crime empty and blood stained was recovered from

the spot and the complainant has failed to prove his presence

on the spot and there are major contradictions in his

deposition with respect to mode and manner of occurrence.

He lastly argued that prosecution has failed to prove its case

beyond any reasonable doubt, hence, by accepting this

appeal, the impugned judgment of conviction deserves

reversal.

7. On the other hand, learned Addl: A.G

representing the State, assisted by learned counsel for

complainant opposed arguments advanced by contending that

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
the convict/ appellant is directly charged for murder of his

own nephew (son of his sister) in day light occurrence. They

next argued that the convict/ appellant is sole assailant and

has been arrested on the following day of occurrence with

crime weapon, for which a separate case F.I.R No.528 dated

06.10.2015 was registered and in which case the accused/

appellant has also been convicted. They further argued that

Site plan, recoveries, medical evidence, F.S.L_ reports,

corroborate the ocular account furnished by the complainant/

eye witness and despite lengthy and taxing cross-examination

the defence could not shatter the prosecution evidence. They

lastly argued that the prosecution has proved its case up to the

hilt and the learned trial court rendered a detailed and

reasonable judgment after rightly appreciating the entire

evidence, which needs not to be interfered with.

8. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for

the parties and scanned the record with their valuable

assistance.

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.

9. Perusal of the record reveals that Abdul Wahab,

the complainant charged the accused for making effective

firing with .30 bore pistol at the deceased, when he was

present at main bazaar, near the shop of his brother deceased

Nawab Ali. The occurrence is of broad day light, i.e 14.20

hours, but the investigation officer did not record the

statement of any independent witness nor the prosecution

could brought any witness before the Court, who may testify

the story of occurrence.

10. Abdul Wahab, is the sole eye witness/

complainant of the case, who also happened to be the brother

of deceased, hence, he legitimately be termed as an interested

witness and the statement of such a witness is to be thrashed

out with due care and caution. In the instant case, the

complainant, the sole eye witness, charged a single accused

for firing at the deceased. Mere fact that single accused is

charged is not an absolute rule regarding his guilt, rather it is

bounden duty of the prosecution to firstly establish presence

of the witness who has allegedly seen the accused and

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
secondly to believe the testimony of solitary eye witness,
requires strong independent corroboration to prove guilt of

the accused. Reference in this behalf may be made to the case

of “Gul Muhammad Vs State and another” (PLJ 2014

-9.

Cr.C (Peshawar)334 (DB), wherein it is held that:

11.

statement as PW-8. He stated the story crime in his

“Though even a solitary statement
would be a base for conviction but in
case when it rang true, confidence
inspiring and trustworthy otherwise,
uncorroborated solitary statement of
an interested and inimical witness
shall not be made basis for conviction

of accused.”

The complainant/ eye witness recorded his

examination in chief as:

“My brother when alighting from his
motorcycle, in the meantime,
accused Noor Alam, who was
already present there made firing at
my brother Nawaz Ali with his

pistol.”

In cross-examination he stated that:

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-10-

“My deceased brother alighted from
the motor cycle at a distance of about
10 paces from the place, where I was
sitting in front of the shop. 02/03 fire
shots were made by the accused at
my brother, however, the deceased
was hit with first fire shot made by
the accused. Accused was not on the
motorcycle, but he was on foot at the

time of making firing at my brother.”

While, the investigation officer, when visited the spot and

prepared site plan, (Ex:PB) he has shown point A, where the

motorcycle was standing and deceased sitting on it, and after

firing of accused he was hit on the motorcycle and fell down

from it. The statement of complainant recorded as PW-8,

contradicts the mood and manner of occurrence, as disclosed

in the site plan by him to the IO.

12. The prosecution produced Umer Ayaz No.256/HC,
as PW-3. During the days of occurrence, he was posted at Civil
Hospital, Karak. He in examination in chief stated that he
recorded statement of complainant in emergency room at 15.00
hours, thereafter the injury sheet, inquest report of deceased

were prepared and sent the dead-body under the escort of levy

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-l1ll-

cop Taimur to Doctor for PM examination. He in cross-
examination stated that the dead-body was brought to the
hospital at about 02.45 hours. While the Doctor Munaim Kaka
Khel MO BHU Dabli, Lawaghar, (PW-06), in examination in
chief stated that “At 02.45 P.M on 05.10.2015, I have
conducted autopsy on the deadbody of the deceased Nawab
Ali.”. In such state of affairs, it is clear then crystal that injury
sheet, inquest report and Post mortem was conducted before
scribing the report of the complainant at 15.00 hours. We have
no hesitation in holding that the complainant lodged report after
preliminary investigation. The F.I.R being basic document in
criminal case vested with much greater sanctity, but when it
was recorded after preliminary investigation, as in the instant
case, it would lose its sanctity and probative worth and as such
would become a suspect document, rather than one giving a
natural, spontaneous and straightforward account of occurrence.
The F.I.R. if recorded after preliminary investigation could not
be treated either sacrosanct or authentic. Similar view was
rendered in case “Muhammad Wasif Khan and others Vs
The State and others” (2011 PCr.L J 470 Lahore) that:-

“FIR. has a very significant role to
play, being a corner stone of the
prosecution case to establish guilt of
the accused involved in the crime--

Any doubt in lodging of FIR. and

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-12-

commencement of investigation give
rise to a benefit in favour of accused-
- F.LR. lodged after conducting an

inquiry loses its evidentiary value.”

Reference can also be made to the case “Iftikhar

Hussain and others Vs the State” _ (2004 SCMR 1185).

13. According to site plan (Ex:PB), the deceased

Nawab Ali was standing on motorcycle, at point A, whereas

the accused having .30 bore pistol was at point 2, the distance

between the Point A and 2 has been shown as 2 to 4 feet, as

per medical jurisprudence, when a fire shot is made from a

distance of less than 3 feet, there may be blackening or

charring marks on the corresponding wounds, but in the

instant case, when we go through the Post Mortem report, we

find no blackening or charring marks, even the Doctor

Munaim Kaka Khel, (PW-6) in his cross examination states

that: “No blackening or charring marks was found on the

entry wound” hence, medical report and site plan are

contradictory to each other, which gives a clear inference that

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-13-

the complainant was not present on the spot and has not

witnessed the occurrence.

14. It has not been mentioned by the complainant in

the F.I.R that how many fire shots were made by the accused,

rather this fact was disclosed in his statement that he made

2/3 fire shots, but strange enough that no crime empty was

recovered from the spot. The accused was arrested on the

following day with a .30 bore pistol, which was allegedly

without any license, hence, a separate case F.I.R No. 528

under section 15 AA was registered against them. The crime

pistol was sent to the F.S.L, which shows that it was in

working condition, but the same result is not sufficient to

prove that the deceased was fired at by the said pistol, in

absence of crime empties. The crime pistol was not recovered

just after the occurrence and further that the accused has not

confessed that the said crime pistol was used in the instant

crime.

15. So for as connected Cr.A No.155-B/2017 with

respect to conviction under section 15 AA, of the same

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-14-

convict/ appellant is concerned, it has other facts and

circumstances of the case. Conviction in said case, has no

bearing upon the facts of instant case, as the prosecution has

failed to prove any nexus of the alleged recovered pistol with

the instant crime, hence, it being a separate offence, has been

decided separately.

16. The contention of learned counsel for

complainant that the convict/ appellant has admitted in his

statement under section 161 Cr.PC that the crime weapon

recovered from him, was used in the commission of offence.

Admittedly the convict/ appellant has not confessed his guilt

before any Magistrate, however, according to prosecution he

has admitted before the local police that the weapon

recovered from him was used in the commission of crime. In

our humble view, admission by the accused before the police

for having committed the offence with some specific weapon

is not admissible in evidence as per Art. 38 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat, 1984. Reliance is placed on case titled “Riasat Ali

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-15-

and another Vs The State and others” (2015 PCr.LJ 995

Lahore).

17. So for as motive is concerned, in the F.I.R it has
been alleged that:
U5 too ASL sige 9S YL @ je 3 al aly"
"1 Gale a: Ail als
The complainant in his statement with respect to said

motive stated that:

“Motive for the occurrence was that
the accused was given a motorcycle
by my other younger brother and the
accused was annoyed as my said
brother had taken back his

motorcycle from the accused.”

Meaning thereby, the motive was with younger brother of the
deceased and not with the deceased or eye-witness/
complainant. Hence, it is held that there was no motive with
the accused to fire at the deceased and if he fired at him, then
on the analogy of above motive, the accused may have fired
at the complainant as well, but it is not the case here. Thus

prosecution has failed to prove motive and presence of eye

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-16-

witness on the spot. On such week and shaky type of motive

conviction for a capital charge cannot be based. Reliance is

placed on case titled “Muhamamd Ali Vs the State” (2017

SCMR 1468).

18. Apart from the above dents and discrepancies in

the prosecution case, it is also smeared with other doubts,

such as non recovery of crime empty from the spot, non

recovery of blood stained earth from the place of occurrence,

absence of bullet/cut marks on the blood stained garments of

the deceased, non recovery of alleged motorcycle, which

deceased allegedly was parking at the time of occurrence, by

the I.0. Hence, the case of prosecution is pregnant with

jumble of doubts. Reliance is placed on case titled

“Muhammad Ali Vs The State” (2017 SCMR 1468).

19. In the present case, no sort of corroborative

evidence is available and even otherwise when the

substantive evidence, which in the present case is the solitary

statement of complainant, is not appealable to reason being

unnatural, contradictory and against natural probabilities, the

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-17-

same could not be made basis for capital charge. Law on this

subject is clear that direct evidence of high unimpeachable

character required for recording conviction on capital charge

against the accused, while it is not the case here, as the

statement of solitary eye witness is full of doubts,

contradictions and not corroborated by any other material

patent on record, therefore, benefit of the same must go the

accused.

20. It is well settled principle of administration of

criminal justice that prosecution is bound to prove its case

beyond any shadow of doubt. If any reasonable doubt arises

in the prosecution case, the benefit of the same must be

extended to the accused not as a grace or concession, but as a

matter of right lest no innocent be punished. In view of

doubtful contradictory and non-corroborative statement of

complainant, whole edifice of prosecution case has razed to

the ground, benefit of which is extended to the appellant, as

conviction of an accused could only be based on concrete

evidence, which beyond reasonable doubt led the Court to the

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-18-

conclusion that the accused before it was guilty of

committing the reported crime. Reliance, is placed on case

titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs the State” (2017 SCMR 144).

21. It is well embedded principle of criminal justice

that there is no need of so many doubts in the prosecution

case, rather any reasonable doubt arising out of the

prosecution evidence, pricking the judicious mind is

sufficient for acquittal of the accused. Reliance is placed on

case law “Tariq Pervaz Vs the State” (1995 SCMR 1345).

The same principle has been reiterated by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in Muhammad Akram’s case (2009 SCMR

230), wherein it is held that:

“13. The nutshell of the whole
discussion is that the prosecution
case is not free from doubt. It is an
axiomatic principle of law that in
case of doubt, the benefit thereof
must accrue in favour of the accused
as matter of right and not of grace. It
was observed by this Court in the
case of Tariq Pervez v. The State
1995 SCMR 1345 that for giving the

benefit of doubt, it was not necessary

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
22.

convicting appellants on the basis of such a weak type of

evidence, hence it would not be safe to maintain conviction.

Consequently, this appeal of the appellants/convict Noor

Alam is allowed and he is acquitted from the charges alleged

against him, vide F.I.R No. 519 dated 05.10.2015 under

sections 302 P.P.C, Police Station Karak. Accordingly,

murder reference No.09-B/2017 is answered in negative.

These are the reasons for our short order, which is re-

-19-

that there should be many
circumstances creating doubts. If
there is circumstance which created
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of the accused, then
the accused would be entitled to the
benefit of doubt not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter

of right.”

The learned trial Court has erred in law by

produced herein below:-

“For the detailed reasons to be
recorded later on, this Criminal
appeal is accepted the impugned
judgment of conviction and sentence

dated 03.07.2017, rendered by

*Azam Khan/P.S* (D.B) Mr. Justice Ikramullah Khan & Mr. Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-20-

learned sessions Judge, Karak, is set
aside and consequently appellant
Noor Alam involved in case F.ILR
No.519, dated 05.10.2015 under
sections 302 P.P.C, Police Station
Karak, district Karak is acquitted of
the charge leveled against him. He
be set at liberty forthwith, if not
required in any other criminal case.
Murder reference No.09-B/2017 is

answered in negative.”
