Cr.P.C which was also extended to the

2. The prosecution version as disclosed in the

Murasila (Ex:PW 2/1) lodged by the complainant Mst.

Fehmida Bibi (PW-2) at the Baithak of Ghani Pir,

situated at Addami Piran to the local police is that, on

03.02.2014 at 1830 hours, accused/ appellant, who is

son of her paternal aunt, (Phophizad), brought her on

the pretext of her mother illness to Adda of Mir Ali and

after searching of her mother in the hospital of Mir Ali

Agency, her mother was not found there and thereafter,
accused/ appellant brought her to Bannu in flying coach

for searching and to inquire about her mother’s health

and she was taken to various places in a Richshaw,

however, they could not found her mother. Thereafter,

the accused/ appellant brought her to a Baithak of

Ghani Khan situated at Addami Piran and She was

subjected to Zina—bil-Jabbar by the accused/ appellant

in the said Baithak. She charged the accused/ appellant

for the same. Consequently on the report of

complainant, murasila was drafted and sent to the

Police station, on the basis of which F.I.R (Ex:PW 3/1)

was registered against the accused/appellant.

3. After completion of investigation,

complete challan was submitted before the trial

court against appellant/ accused Noor Adam. Formal

charge against accused/ appellant was framed to which

he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Trial

commenced. The prosecution in order to prove its case,
examined as many as seven (07) PWs.After conclusion

of trial, statement of accused/ appellant U/S 342 Cr.P.C

was recorded wherein he neither opted to examine

himself under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor, wished to

produce defence.

4. After hearing learned counsel for the

parties, accused/ appellant was convicted and sentenced

as above by the learned trial court, vide impugned

judgment dated 12.12.2014, hence the instant Appeal

for his acquittal.

5. The learned counsel for appellant made his

submissions that the impugned judgment is against law

and facts on record; that accused is falsely implicated in

the present case; that the accused was charged after due

deliberation and consultation; that complainant has

patched up the matter with the accused outside the court

and has got no objection on acquittal of the accused. He

further argued that prosecution case is full of doubts and
contradictions and prosecution has badly failed to prove

its case beyond reasonable doubt. He lastly argued that

the complainant admitted that engagement/ nikah of

accused has already been taken place with her.

6. On the other hand learned Asstt: A.G for

the state vehemently opposed the arguments advanced

by learned counsel for accused/ appellant and argued

that accused/ appellant is directly charged in the report;

that there is no mala fide on the part of complainant and

prosecution; that medical report fully supports the

version of the complainant; that prosecution has

succeeded to prove the allegations leveled against the

accused; that the offence for which accused/ appellant is

charged with is not compoundable, hence, he does not

deserve any leniency on the ground of compounding the

matter with the complainant.

7. Arguments heard and record perused.
8. Perusal of the record reveals that the

accused/ appellant is charged for enticing the

complainant on the pretext of illness of her mother to

the Baithak of one Ghani Khan, where she was

subjected to Zina-bil-jabbar and allegedly on the

information of a private person, the complainant and

accused were found present in the said Baithak, where

she (complainant) reported the matter.

9. The complainant Mst. Fahmida Bibi appeared

and examined as PW-2, she in her cross examination

admitted that her engagement had taken place prior to

the present occurrence. She further admitted it correct

that during engagement, Nikah also recited in between

her and accused. In such a situation, she was wedded

wife of accused/ appellant. No doubt, the Rukhsati of

complainant has not taken place at that time, but even

then the sexual intercourse could not be termed as Zina,

as the Nikah between the complainant and
accused/ appellant existed at that time. As the Zina

constitutes when the marriage is not in existence

between the parties and they commit sexual intercourse,

willfully or with force from any side, while in the instant

case, admittedly, prior to the occurrence a valid Nikah

was in field between the parties. In Islamic law if once

Nikah is recited between the parties, they become

legally wedded husband & wife and can perform

matrimonial obligations including sexual inter course.

No doubt the engagement without reciting Nikah is not

sufficient for the purpose, but here in the case in hand

the situation is a little bit different, as in the instant case,

prior to the occurrence, during the engagement nikah

was recited, as admitted by the complainant, therefore,

no case for the commission of Zina is made out against

the accused/ appellant.

10. Neither in the first information report, nor

in her statement, the complainant has stated that
sexual intercourse was performed forcibly, even

medical report is silent about any signs of violence or

bruises, therefore, it could not be said that she was

subjected to zina bil jabbar, as no jabbar, violence, or

force has been proved from the entire record. This

aspect of the case was more happily dealt with in case

of “Nazra Vs The State” (1970 P Cr.LJ 163.) the

relevant paragraph deserves a verbatim reproduction

which read as under:

The additional circumstance urged is
that there is complete absence of any
injuries on her person or on her
private parts if her statement is to be
considered that she resisted sexual
intercourse by the appellant and
reliance is placed on Mahla Ram vy.
Emperor (A I R 1924 Lah. 669). The
observations of Moti Sagar, J. :-
"Where there is no independent
evidence in support of the statement
of the complainant that she was raped
by the accused, it would be most
dangerous to base a conviction on her

uncorroborated testimony alone; the
first and foremost circumstance that
can be looked for in cases of rape is
the evidence of resistance which one
would naturally expect from a woman
unwilling to yield to a_ sexual
intercourse forced upon her. Such a
resistance may lead to the tearing of
clothes, the infliction of personal
injuries and even injuries on her
private parts. Where there is
absolutely no evidence on the record
of any struggle having taken place
nor were marks of any injuries found
on the person either of the
complainant or of the accused. Held
that the accused cannot be said to
have had connection with the woman
without her consent."

There is no independent evidence to
Mst. Irshad Bibi's evidence and the
additional factor is that at no time has
she stated that she was put in fear by
the appellant. All these circumstances
lead to the irresistible conclusion that
being over 14 years of age Mst.
Irshad Bibi had willingly eloped with
the appellant, that she was a
consenting party to sexual intercourse
with him and the result must be that

the appellant is guilty of no offence in
-10-

law for these reasons. In
consequence, the appeal is allowed
and the conviction and- sentence of
the appellant is set aside. He is on
bail. His bail bonds are cancelled and
the sureties are discharged.”

11. So for as the offence of abduction of

complainant is concerned, the section 365-B P.P.C,

entails as under:

“365-B. Kidnapping, abducting or
inducing woman to compel for
marriage etc.-- Whoever kidnaps or
abducts any woman with intent that
she may be compelled, or knowing it
to be likely that she will be compelled,
to marry any person against her will,
or in order that she may be forced or
seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be
punished with imprisonment for life,
and shall also be liable to fine; and
whoever by means of criminal
intimidation as defined in this code,
or of abuse of authority or may other
method of compulsion, induces any
woman to go from any place with
intent that she may be, or knowing
that it is likely that she will be, forced

or seduced to illicit intercourse with
-l1ll-

another person’ shall also be

punishable as aforesaid.”

This provision provides that when there is intention to

compel for marriage or forced to illicit inter course by

the accused, the offence under section 365-B attracted,

but in the instant case, they were already in Marriage

and the prime witness, Mst. Fehmida Bibi, in her cross-

examination has stated that:

“I was not forcibly taken away by the
accused.”

Again the complainant has not stated in her first

information report and in her statement that she was

compelled or forced, even in medical report there are no

any signs of violence, therefore, the prosecution has

failed to prove the offence under section 365-B P.P.C.

The evidence of complainant does not support the

prosecution version, for the reason that the complainant

had patched up the matter with the accused/ appellant

and was not interested in prosecution of the case,
-12-

therefore, in my humble view, due to this reason, she

has not narrated the corroboratory facts, which may

strengthen the prosecution case.

12. When the prime witness does not charge

the accused/ appellant and is going to live with him as

life partner of the accused and before the occurrence

there was nikah between the parties, then in such a

situation no case for conviction is made out against the

accused/ appellant. The complainant in her cross-

examination further stated that:

“I do not want to further prosecute
the accused and I would have got no
objection if he is acquitted of the
charges.”

Keeping in view the factum of compromise arrived at

between the parties and attending circumstances of the

instant case, in order to keep peace and tranquility in

society to meet the end of justice, it may be considered

and lenient view may be taken. Reliance is placed on
-13-

case titled, “Shakar Vs the State”, (PLJ 2012 Cr.C

(Lahore 897).

13. It is borne out from the record that the

complainant has not lodged report to the local police at

her own, albeit when the local police apprehended them,

the accused/ appellant and complainant, in the baithak,

the complainant lodged the report, meaning thereby

that, if the local police would have not reached at the

spot, no report would be lodged. Further the

complainant in her statement has clearly mentioned that

she was neither forced/compelled, nor medical report

support any violence. Moreover, the person, from

whose baithak they were apprehended has not been

produced and examined either by the investigation

officer or by the trial court, such peculiar facts and

circumstances of the case, led to the inference that she

was consenting party and in such situation, it is not rape

under the law. Reference may be made to case “Nazima
-14-

Shahzadi and another Vs S.H.O and 4 others”, (PLJ

2009 Lahore 405)

The investigator and the Distt. Public
Prosecutor did not bother to go
through the provisions of Sections
375 and 376 P.P.C. A combined
examination of these two provisions
of law would show that only a man
committing rape with a woman under
the circumstances’ mentioned in
Section 375 P.P.C. is liable to face
trial under Section 376 of the Code. It
is also manifest from these provisions
of law that if a man has sexual
intercourse with a woman with her
consent, it is not rape under the law
and at the most the offence of
fornication is committed which is not
a cognizable offence.

14. The other prosecution witnesses are formal

in nature, as neither the occurrence has been witnessed

by any one, nor the accused/ appellant and complainant

were arrested during the course of commission of Zina,

hence, their evidence is not sufficient for conviction of

the accused/ appellant, again in absence of
-15-

corroboratory evidence of star witness, i.e. the

complainant.

15. It is centuries old principle of criminal

justice that prosecution is bound to prove its case

beyond any shadow of doubt and if any reasonable

doubt arises in the prosecution case, benefit of the same

is to be extended to the accused, not as a matter of grace

or concession, but as a matter of right. On reappraisal of

evidence as discussed earlier, this court is of the firm

view that appellant-convict is entitled to the benefit of

doubt. Therefore, while extending the same benefit, this

appeal was allowed and appellant was acquitted vide

my short order of even date. These are the reasons for

my short order, which is re-produced herein below:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later,
the instant Criminal appeal is
accepted, the impugned judgment of
conviction dated 11.12.2014 passed by
the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, Bannu is set aside and

consequently the appellant Noor
-16-

Adam is acquitted of the charges
leveled against him. He be set at
liberty forthwith, if not required in

any other case.”
