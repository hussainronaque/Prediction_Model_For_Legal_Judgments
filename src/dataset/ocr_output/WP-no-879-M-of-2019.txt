JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- Through this

single judgment, we intend to decide instant petition
W.P No. 879-M/2019 as well as connected W.P No.
1121-M/2021, as identical questions of law and facts

are involved in both these petitions.

2. Complainant Zahid Khan, who is
petitioner in instant petition, has averred that on his
report FIR No. 286 dated 05.05.2019 had been
registered u/s 302 PPC, 15 A.A at P.S Shah Dherai,
District Swat against accused Dawood (respondent
No.2) and his co-accused Nazir (petitioner in the
connected petition) on the charge of committing
murder of his brother Wahid Khan. After completion

of investigation, complete challan was submitted

before the learned Judicial Magistrate, Tehsil Kabal

‘Tajamuvcs" {D.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

wherein accused Dawood was placed in Column
No.2 while accused Nazir was placed in Column
No.3. Since, the offence of murder was triable by
Court of Session, therefore, the learned Judicial
Magistrate sent the case to learned Additional
Sessions Judge (trial Court) in terms of section
190(2), Cr.P.C. The accused were summoned and
copies of the case were provided to them in
accordance with section 265-C, Cr.P.C. On
17.07.2019, the learned trial Court discharged
accused Dawood on the ground that prosecution had
put his name in Column No.2. Being aggrieved of the
said order, petitioner/complainant has filed instant
petition before this Court with the prayer for setting
aside order dated 17.07.2019 with further directions
for restoration of the FIR against accused Dawood
for his trial for the murder of deceased in accordance

with law.

3. Accused Nazir has filed the connected
W.P No. 1121-M/2021 wherein he has averred that
this Court has requisitioned original record of the
case from the trial Court due to which the trial Court
is unable to proceed with the trial. He has prayed this

Court that on acceptance of his writ petition, he be
Talamurcs* (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ilaz Khan

discharged and acquitted of the charge leveled
against him. He has also prayed that the judicial
remand by learned trial Court u/s 344, Cr.P.C and his
arrest vide card of arrest u/s 62, Cr.P.C. may be

declared as null and void.

4. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including learned A.A.G.
representing the State and perused the record with

their able assistance.

5. Perusal of the record would reveal that the
Investigating Officer has put the name of respondent
Dawood in column No.2 of challan in view whereof
the learned trial Court has discharged him vide order

dated 17.07.2019 which is reproduced as under:

The moot question for resolution before this
Court is whether the Court is bound to agree with the

Tejas" (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

opinion of Investigating Officer regarding innocence
of an accused shown in column No.2 of the final
report u/s 173, Cr.P.C? The second question is
whether an accused could be discharged when the
trial Court has already taken cognizance of the
criminal case? There is no denial of the fact that
complainant has charged accused Dawood on the
basis of telephonic information, however, the
admitted position is that he has directly been
nominated in the FIR, therefore, his exoneration from
the charge by the learned trial Court at the very initial
stage of the trial does not appear to be a just and fair
conclusion. No doubt, officer-in-charge of police
station or Investigating Officer is empowered under
sections 63 and 169, Cr.P.C to report innocence of an
accused already nominated, however, such opinion of
police officer has no binding effect on Court. The
Court may examine the material on record to
ascertain availability or otherwise of reasonable
grounds for proceeding with trial of accused placed
in column No.2 of the challan. Reliance in this regard
is placed on “Haji Inayat-ul-Haq Vs. Said
Muhammad Khan and others” (1988 SCMR 1743)

wherein it was observed that:

Tefamules? (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan

High Court could go into this aspect of the matter
because the material could clearly be examined
by it and the opinion of the police officer
directing that the accused be placed in Column
No.2 did not stand in the way of making such an
evaluation.

6, Section 265-D, Cr.P.C confers the power
upon the Court to form its opinion that there is
ground to proceed with trial of the accused. The ibid

provision is reproduced below for ready reference.

265-D. When charge is to be framed: If, after
perusing the police report or, as the case may be,
the complaint, and all other documents and
statements filed by the prosecution, the Court is of
opinion that there is ground for proceeding with
the trial of the accused it shall frame in writing a
charge against the accused.

Bare reading of the above provision reflects that
the Court, in light of the police report and other
material, may form an opinion to proceed with the
trial of accused. In other words, the trial Court may
or may not agree with the observations of
Investigating Officer. It appears that in the present
case, the learned trial Court, without going through
the record, has straightaway discharged accused
Dawood on the sole ground that I.O had mentioned
his name in column No.2 of the challan. An accused
could not be discharged in such a mechanical manner

to defeat the ends of justice. The Hon’ble Supreme

‘Tajamucs” (D.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad lJaz Khan
Court, while dilating upon an identical issue in the

case of “Wagqar-ul-Haq alias Nithoo and another
Vs, The State” (1988 SCMR 1428) observed that:

The point involved in this case is that three
persons have been accused of the offence out of
which one Muhammad Rafiq was placed in
column No.3 whereas the present petitioners were
placed in column No.2. The accused person whose
name appears in column No.2 of the challan can
be summoned by the trial Court directly to stand
the trial and it is not necessary that first some
evidence should be recorded. In the present case
the challan against the petitioners had not been
cancelled by placing them in column No.2. It only
meant that according to the police investigation
they were found innocent, and therefore, they
were discharged under section 63 of the Cr.P.C.
However, it does not mean that they could not be
summoned to stand trial by the Sessions Court.

7. The record reflects that SHO had
submitted complete challan u/s 173, Cr.P.C before
the Judicial Magistrate Kabal, who while taking
cognizance of the matter under section 190(1),
Cr.P.C forwarded the same to learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Swat at Kabal for trial of the accused
u/s 302 PPC and 15 A.A. Admittedly, the Judicial
Magistrate had taken cognizance of the case in terms
of sub-section (1) of section 190, Cr.P.C. Since, the
offence was triable by Court of Session, therefore,
the case was forwarded to learned Additional

Sessions Judge, Swat at Kabal in terms of section

Tapmuves" (0.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

190(2), Cr.P.C. The law is settled that discharge of an
accused or cancellation of case by a Magistrate are
not legally possible after cognizance of the case has
been taken by the trial Court. The question whether
the case could be cancelled under section 173,
Cr.P.C. after the Court had taken cognizance, has
been resolved by Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of “Muhammad Alam and another Vs. Additional

Secretary to _Government_of NWF. P, Home &

Tribal Affairs Department and 4 Others” (P L D

1987 Supreme Court 103) by observing that:

Chapter XVII of Cr.P.C. deals with "the
commencement of proceedings before the
Courts". Section 204 therein deals with the
issuance of process by the Court on taking of
cognizance. After taking the cognizance and even
before the issuance of the process, the normal
procedure under the Code or the Regulation, as
the case may be, would be followed. The police
report would not relieve the Court of its
obligation to continue the proceedings until their
proper termination under the relevant law. The
cancellation of case under section 173 is not
permissible after the cognizance has been taken,
But it could have been done before that stage. It
was so held in the Full Bench case of Lahore High
Court, Wazir v. The State (P L D 1962 (W. P.)
Lah. 405), which we feel is correct approach in so
far as this point of cancellation, before
cognizance, is concerned.

After taking cognizance of the matter by
trial Court, culmination thereof is possible only in

three ways firstly; conviction of the accused upon his
Tajamuvcs* (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

plead guilty or on the basis of evidence, secondly; his
acquittal either u/s section 249-A or 265-K, Cr.P.C or
when the prosecution fails to prove his guilt through
evidence and thirdly withdrawal from prosecution by
a Public Prosecutor in terms of section 494, Cr.P.C.
The above view is emerging from the judgment of
High Court of Baluchistan in the case of “Bilal
Ahmed and 2 others Vs. The State” (2021 PCr.LJ

261) in the following words:

It is well settled principle of law that discharge of
an accused by a Magistrate is not legally possible
after taking cognizance of the case. It may be
added here that after taking cognizance by the
trial court only three results are possible in a
criminal case, firstly conviction of the accused
either upon admission of guilt by him or on the
basis of the evidence led by the prosecution;
secondly, acquittal of the accused either under
sections 249-A/265-K, Cr.P.C. or on the basis of
failure of the prosecution to prove its case on
merits beyond reasonable doubt; and _ thirdly,
withdrawal from prosecution by a Public
Prosecutor under section 494, Cr.P.C.

In light of the afore-referred dicta, the
learned trial Court, while discharging accused
Dawood without adhering to material available on
record, has fallen in error by concurring with the
opinion of Investigating Officer qua discharge of the
said accused on the sole ground that his name was
mentioned in column No.2 of the challan.

8. Adverting to the prayer of accused
petitioner Nazir in the connected W.P No. 1121-
M/2021 with regard to his acquittal/discharge, not
only the 1.0 has put his name in column No.3 of the
challan for his trial on the charge of murder and 15
A.A but formal charge has also been framed against
him besides sufficient evidence has been collected
against him during the course of investigation,
therefore, in light of our detailed discussion in the
preceding paras, there is no force in his contention.
His other grievance was that the original record has
been requisitioned by this Court in connection with
writ petition of the complainant due to which the trial
Court has stopped the trial proceedings initiated
against him. Original record has already been sent
back to the trial Court as reflected from order sheet
dated 31.05.2022 of this Court in W.P No. 879-
M/2019, therefore, his above grievance has already

been redressed.

9. In light of the above discussion, instant
petition ie., W.P No. 879-M/2019 is allowed, the
order dated 17.07.2019 of the learned trial Court is
set aside with directions that the learned trial Court

shall proceed with trial of accused Dawood in

dismissed.
