JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through this Cr.Misc.
Application, Khayal Mat Shah, the petitioner has

prayed for:-

i. That order dated 11.04.2023, passed by

a Division Bench of this court in Transfer
Application No. 33-P/2022, may kindly be
revisited/re-considered in light of judgment
dated 01.12.2020 passed by Division Bench
of this Court in WP No.2889-P/2020 and
order dated 20.06.2020, passed in Review
Petition No.178-P/2020 in WP No.
2889-P/2020, administrative order dated
10.11.2022 as well as Civil Petition
pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan.

ii. That keeping in view the judgments
(supra) of this Court and pendency of the
matter before the Hon’ble Supreme Court,
the case may be allowed to be tried by the
court established under the provisions of
section 22 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019;

and

iii, Any other order deems proper may
kindly be passed in favour of the petitioner.

2. As per averments in the application,
petitioner Khyal Mat Shah, is an under trial prisoner in
case FIR No.98/2021 dated 19.10.2020, registered
under Sections 9(c) and 15 Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 (To be referred hereinafter as
“Act of 1997”) at Police Station ANF, Peshawar and is
behind the bars since his arrest on 19.10.2020.
Grievance of the petitioner is that his case has been
transferred from the Special Court established under
section 22 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 2019 (To be referred
hereinafter as “Act of 2019”), to the Special Court
established under the Act of 1997, in compliance with
the judgment dated 11.04.2023, passed by this Court in
Transfer Application No.33-P_of 2022; that on
promulgation of the Act of 2019 on 4" September,
2019, jurisdiction of the Special Court established

under the Act of 1997 was ousted to the extent of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the express provisions of
Section 59 of the Act of 1997, consequently, the
Courts of Sessions Judges and the Additional Sessions
Judges in the Province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
were conferred with the powers of the Special Courts
under the Act of 1997 as well as under the Act
of 2019; that after promulgation of the Act of 2019,
one Muhammad Siddique accused in case FIR
No.143/19 registered under section 9 (c ) of the Act of

1997 registered at ANF, filed Writ Petition No.

2889-P/2020,_ titled, “Muhammad Siddique Vs

Federation of Pakistan & others” before this court
wherein he questioned vires of the Act of 2019 and

sought issuance of the following writ:-

“To declare that arrest/seizures, investigation
conducted by respondent No.4 within the
territorial jurisdiction of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa after the commencement of the
Act of 2019 as illegal, unlawful without
jurisdiction, without lawful authority,
coroum-non-judice and beyond the mandate
of the Act of 2019.

To direct the respondent not to
submit challan before the court of Judge
Special Court (CNS) under the CNS Act,
1997 against the petitioner.

The Writ Petition (ibid) was contested by the

respondents and this court after hearing both the sides,
vide judgment dated 01.12.2020, observed that section
59 of the Act of 2019 has effectively repealed section 9
(c ) of the Act of 1997 to the extent of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa. However, the accused shall be charged
under section 9 or 11 of the Act of 2019, as the case
may be, by an authorized Officer; that members of the
ANF had powers of police for arrest and investigation
of narcotics offences and could investigate offences
under the Act of 2019 as an authorized officer; that
Special court established by the Federal Government
could not take cognizance of an offence under the Act
of 2019, as the special court established under section
22 of the Act of 2019 has the exclusive jurisdiction to
try all offences under the Act. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference relevant part of the
judgment (ibid) is reproduce below:-
“The Courts established under section

22 of the Act of 2019, in view of section
23 have the exclusive jurisdiction to try all
offences cognizable under the Act of 2019,

which read as:-

“§.23._ Jurisdiction to Try

offences:- The special court
shall have the exclusive
jurisdiction to try all offences
cognizable under this Act.

Therefore, the Special Court established
under section 46 of the Act of 1997, could
not take cognizance of any offence, under
the Act of 2019, as in view of Section 45 of
the Act of 1997, such courts established
under section 46 of the Act of 1997 could
exercise power __against _ offences,
committed under the Act of 1997,
however, the Special Court, established
under section 46 of the CNS Act, 1997,
could proceed in accordance with law, in
cases__already registered before the
promulgation of the Act of 2019. Such

cases could not be effected thereof by
promulgation of the Act of 1997.

Therefore, for the reasons
mentioned hereinabove, this and the
connected writ petitions are disposed of
with direction to ANF, to_ substitute

relevant provision of law, rovided

thereunder _the Act of 2019, for the
concern offence and report under section
173_Cr.P.C__be_ submitted _before_the
Special Court _CNSA_established_under
section 22 of the Act of 2019, and cases
already submitted before the Special Court
CNS’ established under section 46 of the
Act of 1997, registered after promulgation
of the Act of 2019, shall be transferred to
competent Special Courts, established
under section 22 of the Act of 2019 and
the Special Courts on receipt of cases, may
substitute, charge the accused under
3.
Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), filed Review Petition
No.178-P/2020 for review of the judgment (supra) of
this court but the same was dismissed vide judgment
dated 20.06.2022, for the reasons that no mistake or
error could be pointed out in the judgment under
review, and secondly, that the matter is subjudice

before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Operative part of

relevant provision of the prevailing law of
the Act of 2019, accordingly.” (Bold and

underlines are our for emphasis).

Being discontented, the Regional Director

the judgment is reproduced below:-

4.

dated 01.12.2020 in WP No.2889-P of 2020, was

“We are of the firm view that review is not
available for reconsideration or re-hearing
of the case. We find that the points urged
by the learned counsel for the petitioners
have elaborately been discussed and
answered by this court in the impugned
judgment; therefore, the same cannot be re-
opened in review petition. Nothing has
been shown by the petitioners that there has
been mistake or error apparent on the face
of the record, whereby judgment passed by
this court could be reviewed, particularly,

when_civi tition for leave _to ea

ainst the _impugned judgment is
sub-judice_ before the Hon'ble Supreme

Court of Pakistan. \n the circumstances no
case for review is made out, consequently,

this review petition is dismissed.

It is important to mention here that judgment
followed and relied upon by this court in its judgment
dated 14.01.2021, rendered in WP _No.1237-P/2021,

titled, “Gul_Khan Vs the State”, relevant part of

which is reproduced below for ready reference:-
“We have before us the judgment of this
Court passed in case titled, “Muhammad
Sidique Vs Federation of Pakistan” (Writ
Petition No.2889-P/2020). In the said
petition, the petitioner had challenged his
arrest and investigation by the ANF in the
cases whereby the contraband were
recovered from him. The question of
jurisdiction of ANF to investigate in the
matter and submission of challan before the
court was extensively discussed in the said
judgment. This court while considering
section 6 of the CNSA, 1997, has held that
ANF has the jurisdiction to arrest and
investigate any matter relating to narcotic.
However, in view of section 59 of the KP
CNSA, 2019 repealing the jurisdiction of

all courts established under CNSA 1997,

this court has held that ANF after
completion of investigation shall submit
challan before the Special Court

established under section 22 of the KP

CNSA 2019. The judgment of this court
was followed in the subsequent judgment

dated 14.01.2021 passed_in WP No.
654-D/2020, therefore, we are not
inclined to hold a different view.
In view of the above, we direct the

ANF to submit complete challan_in_all

these cases before the Special Court
established under section 22 of the KP
CNSA 2019 within fifteen (15) days from
receipt of this judgment. Similarly, if any
challan_is submitted before the Special
Court established under CNSA 1997, the
said Court shall transmit the cases to the
Special Court established under section
22 of the KP CNSA 2019 forthwith. (Bold

and underlines are our for emphasis).
5. In compliance of the judgments (supra) of
all the cases registered by the ANF, after promulgation
of the Act of 2019 and pending trial before the Special
Court (CNS) established under the Act of 1997, were
transferred to the special courts empowered under
section 22 of the Act of 2019 for trial and conclusion.
6. On 31° March, 2022, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances (Amendment) Act,
2022 (To be referred hereinafter as the “Amendment
Act of 2022”) was promulgated whereby section 58A
was inserted in the Act of 2019. Because of insertion
of 58A in the Act of 2019, the respondents filed

Transfer Application No.33-P of 2022, titled, “Anti
Narcotic Force Vs Govt of KPK” before this court

for transfer of all pending cases/trials of the ANF from
the Special Courts established under the Act of 2019 to
the Special Court (CNS) established under the Act of
1997. This court after hearing both the sides vide
judgment dated 11.04.2023, passed the following
order:-

“Since all the cases of ANF pending in any
special Court of CNS, before the
commencement of the Amendment Act,
2022, have been validated and given
continuity to be tried in the Special Courts
under clause (d) of section 58A of the Act
of 2019, therefore, the instant application
is disposed of in terms of directions that
gil the like nature cases pending in the
courts of Secessions Judges/Judge Special
Courts, established by _the Provincial
Government be transferred to the Special
Court (CNS) established by the Federal

Government”.

7. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner has filed
the instant application for reconsideration of the
judgment (ibid), in light of the judgments dated
01.12.2020 in WP No.2889-P/2020 and judgment
dated 14.01.2021, in WP No.1237-P of 2021, which
though have been assailed before the Hon’ble Supreme

Court but being not suspended, still holds the field.

8. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused all the judgments
(ibid) of this court as well as the law on the subject i.e.
the Act of 2019 since its promulgation and till
insertion of section 58A.

9. The main controversy before this larger
Bench is “Whether order/judgment dated 11.04.2023,
passed by Hon’ble Division Bench of this Court in
Transfer_Application No.33-P/2022, in pursuance
whereof cases registered by the Anti-Narcotic Force
(ANF) under the Act of 1997 and pending adjudication
before the Special Courts established under the Act of
2019, after promulgation of the Act of 2019 on
4" September, 2019 till Amendment Act of 2022
notified on 31% March 2022, have rightly been ordered
to be transferred to the Special Courts established
under the Act of 1997?

10. Undeniably, impugned judgment dated
11.04.2023, passed in the Transfer Application
No.33-P of 2022, is in conflict with the judgments
dated 01.12.2020 and 14.01.2021, passed by Hon’ble

Division Benches of this Court in Writ Petition

No.2880-P/2020,_ titled, “Muhammad_Sidique Vs

Federation and others”__and Writ Petition No.

1237-P/2021, titled, “Gul Khan Vs_the State”,

respectively, and rightly so because the former
11

judgment/order has been passed after promulgation of
the Amendment Act of 2022, while the latter two
judgments of the Division Benches are before
promulgation of the Amendment Act of 2022. In the
former judgment, this court has directed ANF, to
substitute relevant provision of law, provided under the
Act of 2019, for the concern offence and report undér
section 173 Cr.P.C. be submitted before the Special
Court CNSA established under section 22 of the Act of
2019, and cases already submitted before the Special
Court CNS established under section 46 of the Act of

1997, registered after promulgation of the Act of 2019,

shall _be_transferred to competent Special Courts,
established under section 22 of the Act of 2019 and
the Special Courts on receipt of cases, may substitute,
charge the accused under relevant provision of the
prevailing law of the Act of 2019, accordingly. Review
Petition No.178-P/2020 filed against the judgment
(ibid) by the respondents has also been dismissed vide
judgment dated 20.06.2022. The respondents have
questioned the judgment (ibid) before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court by filing Civil Petition wherein leave
has been granted, however, judgment of this court has
not been suspended and the matter is still subjudice.
Similarly, judgment dated 14.01.2021 passed by

Division Bench of this Court in WP No.1237-P of
12

2021, wherein the judgment dated 01.12.2020 has been
followed and relied upon, is also still in the field. Since
the judgments (ibid) of this court still hold the field
and the matter is subjudice before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court, therefore, we shall restrict our findings
only to the extent of jurisdiction of the Special Courts
established under the two Statutes/Laws with regard to
the cases registered by the ANF after promulgation of
the Act of 2019 till 31% March, 2022 when the
Amendment Act of 2022 was promulgated, because
large numbers of cases i.e. 315 are pending in limbo on
account conflicting provisions between the two
Statutes.

11. After promulgation of the Act of 2019, in
the year 2022, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances (Amendment Act, 2022) was
introduced on 31s' March 2022 wherein besides other
essential amendments, section 58-A was inserted in the
Act of 2019 so as to curb the anomaly arisen in
pursuance of the two laws, which for the sake of
convenience and ready reference is reproduced below:-

“S$.58A,. Continuation and__validation:-

Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Act or any other law or rules, for the time
being in force:-

(a) The ANF shal! continue to
exercise powers and perform
function under this Act.
13

(b) ~All actions taken,
proceedings commenced and things
done by the ANF under Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997
QAct No.XXV of 1997), in the
province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
before the commencement of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotic Substances (Amendment)
Act, 2022, shall be deemed to have
been validly taken, commenced and
done under this Act.

(c) The police station,
established under section 6 of the
Anti Narcotic Force Act, 1997 (Act
No.III of 1997) shall deemed to be
established under this Act and shall
continue its function under section
44 of this Act; and

(4d) All the cases_of ANF,
pending in any Special Court of
ANF before the commencement of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control_of Narcotic Substances
(Amendment)__Act, 2022 _ shall
continue to be tried in the special

courts.”

12. Admittedly, by the time when the judgments
dated 01.12.2020 and 14.01.2020 were passed by this
court in WP No.2889-P/2020 and Writ Petition
No.1237-P of 2021, respectively, section 58A was not
on the Statute Book of the Act of 2019, therefore, this
court directed transfer of cases registered under the Act
of 1997 by the ANF from the Special Courts

established under the Act of 2019 to the Special Court
14

(CNS) established under the Act of 1997. By insertion
of section 58A (b) of the Amendment Act 2022, all
actions taken, proceedings commenced and things
done by the ANF under the Act of 1997, in the
province of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa before the
commencement of the Amendment Act, 2022, have
been validated, however, this blanket saving has been
circumscribed in clause (d) of section 58A of the
Amendment Act, 2022, whereby its application has
been limited to the extent of case registered by ANF
pending in any special Court constituted under the Act
of 1997 after promulgation of the Act of 2019 till
promulgation of the KP Amendment Act of 2022,
which shall continue to be tried in the Special Courts
established under the Act of 2019. It is on the force of
the Amendment Act of 2022 that the Hon’ble Division
Bench of this Court transferred the pending trials back
to the Special Court established under the Act of 1997
from the special Courts established under the Act of
2019 vide order dated 11.04.2023 passed in the
Transfer Application No.33-P of 2022, however, in the
order ibid it has not been clarified that such transfer of
cases would be applicable to cases of the ANF
registered in the interregnum period i.e. after
promulgation of the Act of 2019 till Amendment Act

of 2022.
15

13. Section 58-A clause (a) of the Act of 2019
declares that ANF shall continue to exercise powers
and perform functions under the Act of 2019. Clause
(ibid) is prospective and affirms the role of ANF under
the Act of 2019 for future cases. It supports the
judgments of this court passed in Writ Petition
No.2889-P of 2020 and Writ Petition No.5072-P of
2020, albeit, with a more pronounced ANF role. The
judgments ibid envisaged ANF members as authorized
Officers according to the definition clause, the
Amendment in the Act explicitly incorporates the ANF
under the umbrella of the Act of 2019. Additionally,
through the deeming clause, section 58-A designates
ANF Police Stations established under section 6, ANF
as Police Station, established under the Act of 2019. It
is furthermore plain that section 58-A clause (b) by
inserting the deeming clause validates all actions done,
proceedings commenced or things done under the Act
of 1997 as if they had been done under the Act of
2019. Read in conjunction, clause (d) of the same
section protects the trial held by the Special Court

ANF under the Act of 1997. On deeming clause writes

N.S _Bindra in “The Interpretation of Statutes
(Seventh Edition, 1984):-

“The word deemed is used a great deal in

modern legislation. Sometimes it is used to
CC

16

impose for the purpose of a statute an

artificial construction of a word or phrase

that would not otherwise prevail.

Sometime, it is used to put beyond doubt a

particular construction that might

otherwise be uncertain. Sometimes, it is

used to give a comprehensive description

that includes what is obvious, what is

uncertain and what is in the ordinary sense

impossible.”
In case titled, “Shah Said vs State” (PLD 1958
Peshawar 51), accused Shah Said was convicted under
section 302 PPC read with section 11 of the Frontier
Crimes Regulation (FCR) and sentenced to 14 years
RI. by the Deputy Commissioner Mardan on 26
April 1954. At the relevant time, FCR was not
extended to District Mardan. On 10" December, 1964,
FCR was amended and extended to six districts
including Mardan and the amending Act read that all
orders made, proceedings taken, sentences passed and
acts done in all the six districts were deemed to have
been validly taken under the Regulation. This Court
while dismissing the writ Petition held as under:-

“Validating Acts are essentially designed
to legalize those acts of the administrative
authorities or statutory bodies which when
done had failed to achieve the expected

results only by reason of some statutory
17

disability or irregularity. The Act validates
all orders made under the Frontier Crimes
Regulation which when made the
authorities concerned honestly and
genuinely thought and believed that they
possessed powers under the Frontier
Crimes Regulation to pass such orders.
The Act is curative in character and there
is no constitutional bar for the legislature
to pass them. The legislature has
unfettered power to make laws giving
them either expressly or by necessary
implication the retrospective operation.
The intention of the legislature that all
previous acts passed by the relevant
authorities are legalized is clear from the
Acts themselves and the courts are bound

to give effect to it.”

Indian Supreme Court in “Central Bureau of

Investigation Vs Suboth Kumar Dutta” 17% January,
1997, while dealing with an objection to Special

Court’s jurisdiction, which had not been constituted
under the newly enacted Prevention of Corruption Act,

1988 held as under:-

“A bare look at the provisions of sub-
section 2 of section 30 shows that anything
done or any action taken or purported to
have been taken under or in pursuance of

the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947,
18

shall be deemed to have been done taken

under or in pursuance of the corresponding

provision of the Prevention of Corruption

Act, 1988. Given this specific provision,

the cognizance of the offence taken by the

Special Court stood saved”.
To refer to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal decision
in “Bauman vs Nova Scotia” (Attorney General),
2001 NSCA 51, the problem lies in recognizing when
an impermissible retrospective operation result. As
was noted William Black in “Charter Rights
Application to Pre-Enactment Events”, 1982, UBCL.
Review (Charter special edition), 59 at P.63:

“The distinction between future
consequences of a _ past event
(retrospective) and a future consequence
of an ongoing condition or state of affairs

(prospective) is often unclear.

14. Granting relief in Transfer Application
No.33-P of 2022, constituted an impermissible
retrospective application of 58-A clause (b) and (d) in
that it required the court to first create invalidity out of
an already valid action. Record of the case shows the
unhappy phraseology in clause (d) led to confusion
regarding the precise interpretation of the Special
Court, prompting a Government’s clarification. In

response, the Government said that the reference to the
19

Special court in clause (d) means the Federal Court
ANF. Despite the muddle sometimes seen in
legislative drafting, it is crucial to ascertain the
legislature’s intent. “Unhappy wording, infelicitous
expression of imperfect or inartistic drafting may not
defeat for that reason alone the obvious object of the
validating law and its retrospective content. The real
question is whether the court can speculate on
presumed intent of the Parliament and rewrite that
object with implicit sense. We listen to largely the
language of the Statute but where, as here, clearing up
of marginal obscurity may make interpretation surer if
light from dependable sources were to beam in, the
court may such aid. What is obvious as legislative
intent from section 58-A clause (b) is that the
legislature gave validity to proceedings conducted
under the Act of 1997, which were otherwise required
to be conducted under the Act of 2019. For the same
reason, the legislature gives protection to the trial held
under the Act of 1997. It is obvious that neither the Act
of 2019 nor the amendment Act of 2022 will have any
impact on the ANF’s authority to investigate offences
of interprovincial narcotics trafficking under the Act of
1997 or the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts
established under the Act of 1997 as section 59 of the

Act of 2019 has repealed the Act of 1997 to the extent
20

of narcotics offences within the province. We are

fortified in this regard by the judgment of the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in case titled, “State through Director

ANF Peshawar vs Yasir Khan”, rendered in Criminal
Petition No.7 of 2021, wherein it has been held that:-

“Consequently, notwithstanding section

59 ibid, the CNS Act, 1997 remains
effective with respect to matters falling
exclusively within the jurisdiction of the
Federation. As _a_ result, the inter-
provincial movement of narcotics is also
outside the ambit _of the repealing
provision, The _Special_Court_ CNS
therefore, possesses jurisdiction to_try

cases to such extent”.

We are also mindful of the Civil Petition for leave to
appeal pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. On
its effect, it is apt to refer to Crawford Statutory

Construction, 1940 Edition:-

“While pending litigation may be
exempted from the operation of curative
statutes in many instances it is not. But, in
either case, however, a number of
problems arise. Moreover, there is also
considerable confusion in the decisions
pertaining to their solution. For instance,
where pending litigation is not exempt,
some courts have held that the Curative
Act will apply even after the case has been
appealed, and others that it will apply to

any case wherein judgment has been
21

appealed and others that it will apply to any
case wherein judgment has been rendered in
the lower court. Perhaps the best rule is that a
final judgment cannot be affected”.

15. As stated above, all actions taken,
proceedings commenced and things done by the ANF
under the Act of 1997, in the Province of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, before the commencement of the
Amendment Act of 2022, shall be deemed to have been
validly taken, commenced and done under the Act and all
the cases of ANF, pending in any Special Court of ANF,
before commencement of the Amendment Act of 2022,
shall continue to be tried in the Special Courts
established under section 46 of the Act of 1997 in terms
of section 58A (d) of the Act of 2019, however, these
pending cases would be dealt with by the Special Courts
constituted under the Act of 1997 in accordance with the
provisions of the Act of 2019. The word “proceeding”
has not been defined anywhere in the Acts (ibid),
however, it is a word much used to express the business
done in courts. In Black’s Law Dictionary Eight Edition
word “proceedings” means (7. The regular and orderly
progression of a law suit, including all acts and
events between the time of commencement and the
entry of judgment 2, Any procedural means for
seeking redress from a tribunal or agency. 3. An act

or step that is part of a larger action. 4. The
22

business conducted by a court or other official

body). In case titled, “Ali Gohar and others Vs Pervaiz

Ahmed and others” (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 427),

the word “proceedings” came up for consideration and
discussion before the Supreme Court wherein it was

observed that:-

“The terms “proceedings” has not been defined in
the Cr.P.C. or P.P.C or even the Act, it would then
be safe to apply its ordinary meaning. A similar
exercise was extensively carried out by this court
in the State Vs Naeemullah Khan (2001 SCMR
1461), wherein the word “proceedings” having
not been defined in Hazara Forest Act, 1936, was
considered in its ordinary dictionary meaning in
the light of the judicial opinion rendered by this
court and across the border. This Court affirms the
opinion regarding the purpose of the term
“proceedings” finally expressed in the said
decision, when it concluded that:-

“Keeping in view the literary

meaning and the interpretation of

the word “proceedings” as

interpreted in various

pronouncements given above, we

are of the opinion that the word
“proceedings” is a comprehensive
expression which includes every
Step__taken towards further
progress of @ cause_in court or
tribunal from its commencement
till __its disposal, In legal
23

terminology the word
“proceedings” means the
instituting or carrying on of an
action of law. Generally, a
“proceedings” is the form and
manner of conducting judicial
business before a court or judicial
Officer, including all possible
steps in an action from its
commencement to the execution
of a judgment and in a more
particular sense it is any
application to a court of justice for
aid in enforcement of rights, for
relief, for redress of injuries, or
damage or for any remedial
objection. It in its general use
comprehends every step taken or
measure adopted in prosecution or

defence of an action.”
Moreover, the amendment has been brought in the
Procedural Law, therefore, shall have no bearing on the
substantive rights of the petitioner. It is also settled law
that amendment in the Procedural Law can be
implemented/given effect retrospectively. Consequently,
this court in its judgment dated 11.04.2023, passed in TA
No.33-P of 2022 has rightly held that all cases of ANF
pending in any special court of (CNS) before the
commencement of the Amendment Act, 2022, have been
validated and given continuity to be tried in the Special
Courts under clause (d) of section 58A of the Act of 2019

to which no exception can be taken.

16. For what has been stated above, the instant
Cr.Misc. No.12-P of 2023 in Transfer Application No.

33-P of 2022, stands dismissed.

17. The worthy Additional Registrar (Judicial)
of this Court is directed send copy of this judgment to the
Director Anti-Narcotic Force (ANF) KP Peshawar and
the worthy Sessions Judges of all the Districts of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shall onward circulate the
same amongst the Special Courts established under the
