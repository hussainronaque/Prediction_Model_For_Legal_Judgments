Nawab

2. Brief but precise facts as deciphered
from the available record are that Respondent
No. 2 by the name of Mst. Ayesha is the real
daughter of the Petitioner, who has been
previously engaged with one Saif-ur-Rahman
resident of Paktiya Afghanistan in June 2016.
As per contents of the petition, the Petitioner
alongwith his family members including the
Respondent No. 2 were settled in Pakistan as
Afghan refugees and later on shifted to their
native country Afghanistan who were without
proper documentation upon instructions of the

Government of Pakistan.

3. On 10.11.2016 daughter of the
Petitioner Mst. Ayesha mislaid from her house
in Afghanistan. After thorough search and on
getting an information it came into the
knowledge of the Petitioner, his daughter had
fled to Pakistan with the active connivance of
the Respondent No. 3 (Fawad) son of Akbar
resident of Mian Kalay Munda District Dir
Lower. In this quandary, the Petitioner lodged a

report in shape of Mad No. 34 dated 28.11.2016
Nawab

with regard to missing of his daughter.
Thereafter, the Respondent No. 2 Mst. Ayesha
was recovered upon the report of the Petitioner
from the house of Respondent No. 3 Fawad and
after her recovery she recorded her statement
before the Magistrate concerned U/S 164
Cr.P.C, wherein she in clear terms admitted to
have fled from Afghanistan to Pakistan through
mountainous path and also affirmed the factum
of Nikah with the Respondent No. 3 Fawad
being her lawful husband. Subsequently she was
later shifted to Dar-ul-Aman. An application has
been preferred by the Petitioner before the
Court of learned Executive Magistrate/Assistant
Commissioner Samarbagh Dir lower with
regard to deporting of the Respondent No. 2,
Mst. Ayesha while at the same time the
Respondent No. 3 Fawad also moved an
application for release/custody of Mst. Ayesha
being his lawful wife. Both these applications
were dismissed by the order dated 16.12.2016.
The Petitioner preferred an application to the

Station House Officer of Police Station Munda
Nawab

for registration of the case against the
Respondents No. 2 (Mst. Ayesha) & 3 (Fawad),
which was not given any heed, therefore another
application with the similar plea was presented
to the DPO Dir Lower, which was also

answered in negative.

4. Next off, the matter was taken to the
Court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi Samarbagh Dir Lower by
filing an application within the meaning of
Section 22- A Cr.P.C for registration of the case
against the Respondents No. 2 (Mst. Ayesha) &
3 (Fawad). Likewise, the Respondent No. 2
(Mst. Ayesha) also filed Criminal Revision
before the said learned Court against the order
of the learned Executive Magistrate Samarbagh
dated 16.12.2016, wherein the Present Petitioner
was arrayed being necessary party and after
hearing learned counsel for the parties both the
applications and criminal revision were
dismissed through separate orders dated
20.02.2017 respectively. Hence, being

aggrieved from orders of the learned fora below
Nawab

the Petitioner approached this Court through the
writ petition in hand inter-alia on the grounds

mentioned therein.

5. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, available record with

their able assistance gone through.

6. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
relied on oral submissions while learned counsel
for the Respondents No. 2 (Mst. Ayesha) & 3

(Fawad) referred to PLD 1997 Lahore 666"

Mst._ Sajida_Bibi_and_another_vs_ Incharge
Chowki_No.2"", 2006 MLD 298 (Lahore) "
Mst._Zohra_ Bibi_vs_ Superintendent _Dar-ul-
Aman and another", PLD 2010 Quetta 61 Mst.
Giran Naz alias Shagufta Bibi vs the State and

2 others". In the light of these dictums of the
Hon'ble superior Courts submitted that
Respondent No. 2 (Mst. Ayesha) being
â€˜sui juris' contracted marriage with her own
sweet will with the Respondent No. 3 (Fawad)
as right to marry was a constitutional protected

right in terms of Article 35 of the Constitution.
Nawab

7. The available record transpires that
the Petitioner has failed to bring on record any
documentary evidence in respect of his
deportation to his native country Afghanistan,
rather the Respondent No. 2 Mst. Ayesha has
been shown card-holder of the registration card
issued by the Government of Pakistan being
Afghan refugee, thus, plea of the Petitioner in
respect of initiation of criminal proceedings
against the Respondent No. 2 (Mst. Ayesha),
being illegal migrant within the meaning of
Section 14 (2) of the Foreigners Act,1946 could

not be advanced.

8. The purpose behind the perception
prayer of this writ petition is to set aside the
impugned order/judgment of the Respondent
No. 4, Justice of Peace/Additional Sessions
Judge Dir Lower which require to be declared
as without lawful authority and of no legal
effect and to pass directives for registration of
an FIR against Mst. Ayesha daughter of the

Petitioner and Respondent No. 3 (Fawad),
Nawab

according to the facts of the petition dated

22.12.2016 filed by the Petitioner.

9. As subject for the registration of the
case as highlighted in the petition pertains to
Section 14 (1) against Respondent No. 3 Fawad
and sub-section 2 against Respondent No. 2
Mst. Ayesha of the Foreigners Act 1946, thus it

reads as under:-

14. Penalties:- If any person contravenes the
provisions of this Act or of any, order made
thereunder, or any direction given in
pursuance of this Act or such order, he shall
be punished with imprisonment for a term
which may extend to five years and shall also
be liable to fine, and if such person has
entered into a bond in pursuance of clause (f)
of sub-section (2) of section 3, his bond shall
be forfeited, and any person bound thereby
shall pay the penalty thereof or, show cause to
the satisfaction of the convicting Court why

such penalty should not be paid.

(2) Where any person knowingly enters into
Pakistan illegally, he shall be guilty of an
offence under this Act and shall be punished
with imprisonment for a term which may
extend to ten years and fine which may

extend to ten thousand rupees.
Nawab

10. The Foreigners Act, 1946 (XXXI of
1946) has conferred certain powers upon
Federal Government in respect of foreigners.
The preamble reveals that whereas it is
expedient to provide for the exercise by the
Federal Government of certain powers in
respect of the entry of the Foreigners into
Pakistan, their presence and their departure
therefrom. It is extended to the whole of
Pakistan including Tribal areas and it shall
come into force on the 23rd day of November
1946. Section 3 of the Foreigners Act, 1946
empowers Federal Government by its orders for
making provision either generally or with
respect to all foreigners or with respect to any
particular foreigner or any prescribed Class or
description of foreigner, for prohibiting,
regulating or restricting the entry of foreigners
into Pakistan, or their departure therefrom of
their presence or continued therein. The powers
for any action under the Foreigners Act, 1946
has been specifically delegated to the Provincial

Government and individual like Aman Ullah the
Petitioner herein has no Jocus standi to move
any application for registration of the case under
section 14 (1) and (2) of Foreigners Act, 1946
as such like powers are exclusively within the
domain of either of the functionaries of Federal
Government or Provincial Government
extending these powers even to the Tribal

Territories.

11. In our view and while considering
the matter from every possible angle, the order
of the learned Justice of Peace has been
decorously passed which calls for no
interference under the constitutional jurisdiction
of this Court. Ergo this petition stands

dismissed.
