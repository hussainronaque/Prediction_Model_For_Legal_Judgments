The depositions of these PWs evince that on
22/08/2021, the eventful day, a Levy contingent led by
Subedar Ali Khan, the Post Commander of Kopar,
Malakand District, was on its routine patrolling duty in
the locality when it got spy information that narcotics
in huge quantity were being smuggled from Mardan to
Malakand. The contingent laid barricade on the road.
At 11.45 am, a datsun pick up bearing registration #
KV 4539 came there from the area of village Badraga.
The datsun pick up stopped at the barricade in response
to the signal of the levy personnel. PW4 Imtiaz Ahmad
led the search and the recovery proceedings. The driver
disclosed his name as Malak Aman (appellant), a
hy resident of village Methakhel Yar Hussain, District
Swabi. From underneath the driver seat of the datsun
pick up five packets of chars were found. Each packed
on being weighed was found to be 1200 grams (total
6000 grams). From each packet 10 grams as
representative sample was separate for the purpose of
chemical analysis. The Each sample and the remaining
were put in 06 parcels on which seals bearing initials
“TZ” ver} put. PW4 prepared a memo of the recovery
and cited PW5 Fakhr-ul-Islam and Madad Muharrir
Ishaq Anwer as it marginal witnesses. He cursorily
interrogated the appellant. The latter told that the

charas was owned by a Matiullah alias Asif son of

Abdul Sabooh /* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID 1OBAL
@ 5

Abdullah, a resident of Koragh Chowk in Mardan.
PW4 then prepared wrote the report of the incident in
the shape of a murasila and forwarded it through driver
PW6 to the Levy Post of Kopar for registration of the
case. The case in hand was registered at the strength of
FIR # 86 the same day against the appellant and
Matiullah alias Asif under sections 9 (D) and 17 of the
KP CNSA 2019. PW4, who conducted the seizure,

thus stood as the complainant of the case.

8. PWs 4, 5 and 6 candidly retold the above
story of the case, fully verifying the details of the
search and seizure proceedings, including most notably
the recovery. These PWs were cross examined by the
counsel for the appellant. Numerous questions were
hy asked from PW4 under cross examination. Key
questions include the presence of the Post Commander
on the crime scene; the exact place of the patrolling;
the place at which the informer’s passed on the
information; the time before the incident; the order in
which the search and seizure was carried out; the
presence of the private person near around the crime
scene; and the monogram on the seal. PW4 replied that
the Post Commander was present on the crime scene at
the relevant time; he couldn’t recollect the exact place

of the contingent’s presence when the information was

Abdul Sabooh /* (0.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHIO JOBAL

received; he stated the sequence of the recovery

proceeding; he showed the time before the incident as
02 hours patrolling; he admitted the crime scene a
public place and the initials “IZ” on the monogram. No
substantially contradiction could be created as to the
presence of the contingent, the arrival of the appellant
at the crime scene and the recovery of the contraband
charas. All of the above referred key and other
questions even if answered in the negative could not be
seen as dents as substantial as to pull down the

prosecution case.

9. A couple of aspects, however, may be
touched. First, even after its merger in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province under the 25" Constitutional
Amendment, the levy still continues to work as police
force. The presence of the Post Commander and the
investigation by criminal cases by the members of the
operation wing of the levy force continues. Second, the
association of the private persons with the recovery
would have lent greater credibility to the recovery.
However, it is not a requirement of the law where
personal search is conducted. Third, PW4 admitted that
he didn’t send the case property along with the

murasila to the Levy Post. Fourthly, on the request of

the learned defence counsel, the learned trial Court

Abdul Sabooh /* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL
S

opened the parcels containing the contraband charas.

The learned defence counsel proved unsuccessful to
create a material doubt from the parcels. Rather, while
examining the parcels, the learned trial Court recorded
its observations to the effect that the numbers of almost
the all of them were found proper and correctly

numbered.

10. The record shows that the seizing officer
himself took the case property to the Levy Post and
handed it over to the Muharrir there. Legally,
compliance of section 103, Cr. P.C is not mandatory in
narcotics cases. The learned Assistant Advocate
General informed that the policing duties are still
performed by the personnel of Levy in District
Malakand after its merger under the Constitution
(Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2018. PW-4 also
specifically verified that he conducted the search of the
datsun pick up and seized the charas from its secret
cavities underneath the driver’s seat seizure fully

verifying themselves as the personnel

11. Much of the same could be is worth
seeing from the cross examination of PW4, the
marginal witness of the recovery memo. Rather, PW5
confirmed that he was and other levy personnel were

present on crime scene; spy information was received

@ 8

during the patrolling duty; and more so, at 11.45 am,
the appellant came to the crime scene while driving the
datsun pick up from which the contraband charas was

recovered.

12, Next, J shall come to the safe custody of
the contraband charas and its safe transmission to the
FSL. PW6 testified that he took the murasila along
with the parcels containing the contraband charas to
the Levy Post. PW4 deposed that he didn’t send the
case property to the Levy Post. This is obviously a
contradiction. PW1 Muharrir Fazal Wahid deposed
that he received murasila and the case property from
PW6 (driver Hamid-ur-Rahman). According the Daily
Diary # 11 of the arrival of Levy contingent in the
ky Levy Post, PW4 took the appellant and the case
Ke property to the Levy Post and handed over both the
appellant and the case property to the Muharrir. The
latter then entered the case property in Register # 19,
an extract of which was produced in the statement of
PWI as ExPWI/1l. The aforesaid DD notes that the
Levy contingent reached back to the Post at 2.20 pm.
The murasila was prepared at 12.15 pm. PW4 reached
back to the Post after 02 hours. As per the past practice
in Malakand district, the complainant also conducted

investigation. While leaving for patrolling duty, the

Abdul Sabooh /* (0.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

complainant recorded his departure in DD # 6 which

shows 9.00 am as the time of departure.

13. Constable Zahid Said (PW2) furnished
evidence of the fact that he received the case property
from the Muharrir on 23/08/2021, the next day of the
occurrence, and took it to the FSL in Swat. He showed
his rahdari receipt as Ex PW1/2. The FSL report
shows: firstly, positive report of the samples as charas;
and secondly, the belt # of PW 2 as 5851 and
23/08/2021 as the date of receipt of the samples. Thus,
the safe as well as prompt transmission of the

contraband charas was successfully proved.

14, Of no less importance is the testimony of
one Ibrar Ali son Namir Khan, a resident of Manahkhel
of village Ismaila of the Razar Tehsil in District Swabi,
recorded as PW3. Ibrar Ali testified that he is the real
owner of the datsun pick up which he had given to the
appellant on 18/07/2021 on daily-wage-basis. He
added that on eventful day, he came to know that the
appellant was smuggling charas in the dastun pick up.
He produced valid documents of his ownership to the
Investigating Officer, recorded his statement before
him and the Court of Judicial Magistrate. While under
cross examination, he stated that before giving the

vehicle to the appellant he had confirmed that the

Abdul Sabooh /* (D.B) JON”  JUSTIC! il A
10
appellant was not previously involved in such like

cases.

15, The conclusion of the above discussion is
that the prosecution has successfully proved the charge
against the appellant. All the PWs furnished plain,
positive and clear-cut evidence that the appellant was
found driving the datsun pick up from which huge
quantity of charas (6000 grams) was recovered. The
recovery and chain of safe custody and transmission of
the case property was fully proved. The FSL returned a
positive report. Certain discrepancies were identified
but those were minor in nature and worth ignoring in
the circumstances of the case. It is pertinent to refer

relevant case law.

16, In the case of Faisal Shahzad vs. The

State reported as 2022 SCMR 905 [Supreme Court

of Pakistan], it was held:

“All these witnesses have narrated the
prosecution story in natural manner and
remained consistent throughout and their
testimony could not be shattered by the
defence despite lengthy cross-examination.
The said witnesses had no enmity with the
petitioner to falsely implicate him in the
present case.”

17, In Liaquat_Ali_and_another_vs. The

State reported as 2022 SCMR 1097 [Supreme Court

of Pakistan], the august Court observed:

Abdul Sabooh /* (0.8) }ON'BLE. uss: + KHU Al
Tj ial

“This Court in a number of judgments has
held that testimony of police officials is as
good as any other private witness unless it is
proved that they have animus against the
accused. However, no such thing could be
brought on record by the petitioners in this
case. This Court has time and again held that
reluctance of general public to become
witnesses in such like case has become
judicially recognized fact and there is no way
out to consider statement of official as good
witnesses, as no legal bar or restriction has
been imposed in such regard. Police officials
are as good witnesses and could be relied
upon, if their testimony remains un-shattered
during cross-examination.”

18. Similarly, in Rehmat Gul vs. The State
2022 P.Cr.L.J 10 [Peshawar], the honourable Court

was of the view that:

“No doubt, the PWs are police officials but

nothing in black & white is available on file to

show their ill-will or enmity with the
yy appellant to falsely implicate him in case.”

19, Another relevant case is of Muhammad
Faisal _vs. The State reported as 2022 YLR 1163

{Sindh]. Its relevant paras read:

13. [...]

(a) That the arrest and recovery was made on
the spot and the appellant was caught red
handed with the narcotics by the police whose
evidence fully corroborates each other in all
material aspects as well as the prosecution
case. It is well-settled by now that the
evidence of a police witness is as reliable as
any other witness provided that no enmity
exists between them and the accused and in
this case no enmity has been suggested
against any of the police PW’s and as such
the police had no reason to falsely implicate
the appellant in a false case. Thus we believe
the police evidence which is corroborative in
all material aspects. In this reliance is placed
on Ijaz Ahmed v. The State (2009 SCMR 99).

(h) That although no Independent mashir was
associated with the arrest and recovery of the
appellant it has come in evidence that no
private person was prepared to become an
independent mushir at the time of arrest and
recovery despite being asked. Even otherwise
section 103, Cr.P.C. is excluded for offenses
falling under the Control of Narcotics
Substances Act, 1997 by virtue of section 25
of that Act. In this respect reliance is placed
on the case of Muhammad Hanif v. The State
(2003 SCMR 1237).”

20. In light of the above re-appraisal of the
evidence of the prosecution and the legal principles
laid down in the case law, I uphold the conviction and
sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Judge Special Court/Izafi Zilla Qazi Malakand
at Dargai, against the appellant. The instant appeal is,

thus, dismissed.
