JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Petitioners

1. Arbab and 2. Haider Ali, whose earlier plea for bail has
been turned down by this Court on merits in case FIR
No.269 dated 04.12.2014 registered under sections
324/392/34 PPC, through this further petition, seek the
concession of bail on fresh ground i.e. on the ground of
delay in conclusion of trial within the period specified by
this Court vide order dated 06.04.2015 in Cr.Misc.BA
No.301-P/2015.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. This court while declining bail to the
petitioners vide order dated 06.04.2015, directed the
prosecution and the learned Trial Court in the following
manner:-

“However, prosecution is directed for

submission of challan within a week and the

learned Trial Court for conclusion of trial as
early as possible, but not later than two
months, from the date of receipt of the record.
In case of failure in conclusion of trial within
the specified period, if delay was not on the
part of the petitioners or any person acting on
their behalf, they will be at liberty to file
identical petition for their release on bail
before the learned Trial Court, which shall be
disposed of independently, in accordance with
law”.
Record divulges that challan was put in court on
04.05.2015, followed by compliance of provision of
section 265-C Cr.P.C. on 19.05.2015, and framing of
charge on 06.06.2015. PWs were summoned for
15.06.2015, on which date PWs Dastan Ali LHC, Taleem
Gul THC, Refaqat Ali FC and Gulzar MHC, appeared, but
sent unexamined on the request of learned counsel for the
complainant, who submitted Wakalat nama. On
26.06.2015, PW Dastar Ali was examined while PW
Taleem Gul abandoned. On 07.07.2015, newly arrested
accused Arbab Ali and Haider Ali, were produced and
their supplementary challan was received by the learned

Trial Court. On the same date, provisions of section 265-C

Cr.P.C. were complied with against them, however, neither
any signature nor any thumb impression of the accused has
been obtained on the margin of the order-sheet dated
07.07.2015. Such irresponsible conduct of the learned Trial
Court, may at the fag end of trial, be a cause to vitiate the
entire proceedings, in case the accused took the plea of
non-delivery of any copies to them within the meaning of
S. 265-C Cr.P.C. or even may cause remand of the case in
case of their conviction and appeal before the Appellate
Court. On 06.08.2015, charge against the newly arrested
accused was framed and PWs were summoned for
12.08.2015, on which date, PW Gulzar Hussain MHC was
examined while rest of the PWs could not be examined due
to absence of counsel for complainant. On 16.09.2015, due
to absence of complainant PWs could not be examined and
the case was posted to 29.09.2015, on which date the
Presiding Officer remained on leave and the case was
posted to 10.10.2015. On 10.10.2015, PWs remained
absent. On 19.10.2015, PW Shafgqat Ali examined while
remaining PWs remained absent hence, were directed to be
summoned for 29.10.2015.

4. A careful perusal of order-sheets of the
learned trial Court, reveal that delay in conclusion of trial

within the period specified by this Court, cannot be

attributed to the petitioners, rather it can safely be assigned
to the prosecution as well as the learned Trial Court,
because on some dates despite attendance of the PWs, they
could not examined on the request of learned counsel for
the complainant, while on some dates PWs remained
absent, but the learned Trial Court has not shown any
efforts, much less serious, in procuring their attendance by
adopting coercive methods under the Procedural Law, so
much so, considering the gap of days between the
adjournments i.e. from seven to ten days, the learned Trial
Court has not shown any respect to honour the direction of
this Court. Had the learned Trial Court been serious in
honouring the direction of this Court, it could proceed with
the trial on day to day basis keeping in view the
apprehension of expiry of the specified period. The
disrespectful attitude of the learned Trial Court being
highly deplorable is deprecated. If the subordinate
Judiciary does not show any respect towards the Higher
and Superior Judiciary by following the directions, it
would not only convey a wrong message to the other
Institutions of the country and society but would
eventually frustrate the ends of justice and destroy the

entire system of Judiciary.

5. In view of the above, even if further time is
provided for conclusion of trial, it would serve no useful
purpose because neither the prosecution is serious in
leading its evidence nor the learned Trial Court is expected
for honouring the direction of this court, therefore, this
court is left with no other option but to release the
petitioners on bail at the cost of the prosecution. I, by
allowing this petition, direct the petitioners to be released
on bail provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds to
the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and
resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the Trial Court.
6. I deem it appropriate to refer to Cr.Misc. BA
No.1753-P/2015, titled, “Abdur Rahim Vs the State”
wherein bail was granted by this court on 21.10.2015, on
the ground of delay in conclusion of Trial within the period
specified by this Court and it was the same learned Trial
Judge, who failed to honour the directions. For ready
reference, I would like to reproduce the relevant part of the
judgment as under:-

“It appears from order sheets of the

learned Trial Court, that the case has been

adjourned due to persistent non-attendance

of the PWs. The learned Trial Court,

despite unambiguous directions of this
court, has not taken pain to conclude the
trial within the specified period and has not
adopted any coercive methods against the
unexamined PWs under the Procedural
law. If the prosecution has demonstrated its
lethargic conduct in production of the PWs,
at the same time, the learned Trial Court
too has not shown any respect to comply
with order of this court, which conduct
being highly deplorable shall not be
countenanced in future. Had the learned
Trial Court been serious and conscious qua
direction of this court, it could proceed
with the trial on day to day basis for
compliance of order of this court in a letter
and spirit, but such is not the situation
herein.

The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of
this Court is directed to communicate copy
of this order/judgment to the learned
Sessions Judge, Kohat for taking the

matter into consideration and keeping
check over the matters involving directions

of this court, in future”.
7. This is for the second time that this Court
observed the same conduct and negligence on the part of
the learned Trial Judge/ Additional Sessions Judge-III,
Kohat, which either reflects his incompetency or
intentional disobedience to honour the directions of this
Court, therefore, the Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court is directed to call the explanation of Trial Judge
Mr. Irshad Ahmad Khan Additional Sessions Judge-III,
Kohat, as to why disciplinary action under the relevant law
should not be taken against him for not honoring the
directions of this Court. His reply should reach this court
within a fortnight; otherwise, a unilateral action will be
taken against him.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
