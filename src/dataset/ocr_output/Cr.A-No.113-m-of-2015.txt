2. The prosecution story as advanced
through 'Murasila' Ex. PW-5/1 followed by
lodging of First Information Report Ex. PW-7/1
would reveal that the complainant Sardar Ali
(PW-1) on 22.9.2013 at 09:00 hours at the venue
of crime (mountain) known as Ranjay situated
within the local limits of Bar Butyal Besham
District Shangla reported the matter to the police
that he along with his father by the name of
Ahmad Khan as usual early in the morning were
busy in cutting of grass. In the meanwhile, all of
a sudden accused Farman, Hameedullah sons of
Muhammad Umar and Rahat son of Sartaj came
there. Amongst these accused, Hameedullah was
armed with shotgun and on seeing them started
firing upon his father Ahmad Khan (deceased)
with the intention to commit his Qatl-e-Amad,
as a result of these fire shots his father was hit
on different parts of his body and died at the
spot. The occurrence was stated to be witnessed
by the complainant. He also advanced specific
motive which was a dispute over women-folk.
These narrations of the complainant were

reduced into ‘Murasila' and later on its basis FIR

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
ibid was lodged against the
accused/Respondents.

3. The Investigation Officer, Muhammad
Saeed ASI (PW-10), who upon receipt of
information visited the spot along with other
police 'Nafri’, where corpse of the deceased was
lying and the complainant Sardar Ali (PW-1)
reported him the matter. He dispatched the
‘Murasila’ for registration of the case to the
concerned police station and prepared injury-
sheet and inquest report on the dictation of the
SHO PW-5 and sent the dead body of the
deceased to the hospital for postmortem
examination. He prepared site plan at the
instance of the complainant. The Investigation
Officer as such carried out all the necessary
proceedings in shape of Ex. PW-10/1 to Ex.
PW-10/11 and upon completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted against the
accused/respondents in the Court of learned Zila
Qazi Shangla. After compliance of the
proceedings under section 265-C, Cr.P.C the

trial was formally commenced.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.
4, When charge-sheeted by the learned
trial Court on 25.11.2013, each of the
accused/Respondent did not plead his guilt and
claimed trial. In order to bring home charges
against the § accused/Respondents, _ the
prosecution examined the complainant/sole
eyewitness of the occurrence Sardar Ali as PW-
1, Abdur Razzaq as PW-2, Muhammad Hussain
as PW-3, Rashid Ahmad as PW-4, Sher Hassan
Khan SHO as PW-5, Fazal Hussain DFC as PW-
6, Ziarat Khan Constable as PW-7, Anwar Zada
Constable as PW-8, Dr. Khalil-ur-Rahman as
PW-9 who has conducted postmortem of the
deceased Ahmad Khan and Muhammad Saeed
ASI as PW-10, who has conducted investigation
in the present case.

5. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused were examined under section
342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the charges,
professed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case. They, however, did
not wish to produce defence nor to examine
themselves on oath as required under section

340(2), CrP.C.

6. On conclusion of the trial in Sessions
Case No. 81/2 of 2013, the learned Sessions
Judge/ Zilla Qazi Shangla Camp Court at Swat
was not impressed with the evidence put-
forward by the prosecution, thereby acquitted
the accused/Respondents vide the judgment
dated 07.5.2015,hence the present appeal.

7. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the complainant (Appellant), learned
counsel for the acquitted accused/Respondents
and learned State Counsel appearing on behalf
of the State, requisitioned record was delved
deep into with their valuable assistance.

8. It appears from the record that
initially the law of the land was put into motion
when the complainant Sardar Ali being the sole
eyewitness of the occurrence reported the matter
to the local police that on the doomful day he
(complainant) in the company of his father
(deceased Ahmad Khan) were busy in cutting of
grass as usual early in the morning in the
mountain known as Ranjay situated at Butyal
Besham. In the meanwhile, abruptly the

accused/Respondents came there. Amongst

Nawab (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
whom the accused Hameedullah was armed with
shotgun and on sighting them he started firing
upon his deceased father. Due to which he was
hit on different parts of his body and died at the
spot. The occurrence was witnessed by the
complainant and he also advanced specific
motive which was stated to be a dispute over
women-folk. It is basic principle of
administration of criminal justice that whenever
there is sole eyewitness of the occurrence who
being closely related to the deceased being his
real son then in such circumstances his
testimony qua guilt of the accused should have
been taken with extra care and caution, as such
solitary piece of evidence could make or break
the case of prosecution. The complainant Sardar
Ali though reiterated his stance taken in the
'Murasila' followed by lodging of the First
Information Report, yet during  cross-
examination he has admitted that at the time of
occurrence the distance between him and the
deceased was 5 feet and keeping in sight the
place of occurrence which was admittedly a

mountain as per site plan Ex. PW-10/1 being

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
situated at remote far-flung area, for sake of
arguments how could the accused would spare
the sole eyewitness being son of the deceased
who could depose against them during trial
especially when there was previous enmity in
between the parties on account of dispute over
women-folk. So, the mode and manner of the
occurrence as advanced by the complainant is
not appealable to prudent mind. In the context of
the present case the testimony of PW-2 Abdur
Razzaq would also be of paramount importance
as he was introduced none else but the
complainant himself to be the person who soon
after the alleged firing upon the deceased father
attracted to the spot. Who stated in his
examination-in-chief that on the day of occurrence
he was going to Besham Bazar in order to
purchase grocery for his house and when crossed
the place of occurrence near the turn he saw the
accused Hameedullah duly armed with shotgun in
the company of co-accused Farman and Rahat
were fleeing from the venue of crime. Yet during
cross-examination he deposed that he saw

the accused from a distance of about 50/60

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
feet and when the accused were decamping from
the spot they were visible to him from back side
and they were also looking towards him,
meaning thereby, that from such long distance
how could this PW __ spotted the
accused/Respondents with such clarity
especially when the occurrence took place at
mountainous area. This PW further stated in his
cross-examination that on the next day of the
occurrence at about 4:30 hours when the police
were gathering information from the local
villagers about the occurrence he met with them
and on query narrated the whole story. Here the
question arises, that why this PW kept mum for
one day and reported the matter to the local
police with such considerable delay.

9. The above contradictions and
improvement makes the story of prosecution
doubtful. The rule for safe administration of
justice is that improvements made by an
eyewitness in order to strengthen the prosecution
case, lose their credibility and evidentiary value
and when a witness made _ contradictory

statement or changing his version to suit the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
on

situation, if found to be deliberate and dishonest,
would cause serious doubt on his veracity qua
guilt of the accused. In this regard, reliance is
placed on the case law cited as “Farman Ahmad
ys. Muhammad Inayat” (2007 SCMR 1825). In a case
of this nature where there is contradiction in the
ocular version being furnished by a sole
eyewitness of the occurrence qua other
corroborative/supporting evidence then it
becomes duty of the prosecution to establish its
case through cogent and convincing evidence,
which element is missing in the present case.
There is no denial of the fact that even testimony
of a single eyewitness would be sufficient to
bring home charges against an accused/person
but when such an _ eyewitness made
improvements and his version did not match
with the actual occurrence, rather his testimony

whisk off his presence from the spot and it

po prima facie seems that the occurrence was

unseen and un-witnessed and the assertion of the
complainant being sole eyewitness is not
appealable to prudent mind then such ocular

evidence is of no use to the prosecution which

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
( )

no

10

has rightly been discarded by the learned Trial
Court.

10. It is also an admitted fact floating on
the surface of the record that the sole eyewitness
of the occurrence is the real son of the deceased
Ahmad Khan whether his testimony would fall
under the category of ‘interested witness’ who
advanced the whole story just to strengthen the
case of murder of his father being committed by
unknown accused/persons at mountainous area,
thereby introduced himself as an eyewitness. In
this context, the conduct of the complainant is
also worth of to be looked into as it is story of
the prosecution that the deceased Ahmad Khan
was done to death through fire shots by the
accused, yet at the relevant time no signs of
resistance have been shown by the complainant
in order to at least save his father from the grasp
of assailants, rather he became a mere spectator,
so, such kind of attitude of the complainant
being sole eyewitness and real son of the
deceased is beyond understanding of natural

human conduct.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
11. When ocular-account being furnished
by sole eyewitness is not of such a caliber to be
relied upon, the other corroborative and
circumstantial evidence will come into field in
order to prove the guilt of accused/Respondents.
As per version of the complainant his deceased
father was killed by the accused Hameedullah
through fire shots of shotgun held by him at the
time of occurrence and allegedly the accused
made three (3) fire shots upon the deceased
Ahmad Khan coupled with the fact that the
complainant/eyewitness remained at the spot
with the corpse of his deceased father till arrival
of the police to the venue of crime. Yet during
spot inspection no crime empty has been
recovered, which totally negates the stance of
prosecution as if the deceased was done to death
by the accused Hameedullah with his shotgun
and he would have made three (3) fire shots
upon the deceased then there should have been
crime empties existed on the spot. As the
complainant was present at the spot till arrival of
the police and nobody in his presence would

dare to remove the crime empties from the place

Nawab (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
wer

12

of occurrence. So, this element too makes the
case of prosecution doubtful.

12. During cross-examination PW-10
Muhammad Saeed Khan ASI admitted that the
accused Hameedullah made judicial confession
before him and further stated that the alleged
weapon of offence was kept by him in the house
of his relative Nisar. So, when the police party
in the company of accused went to the house of
Nisar, who came out of his house and stated that
the gun is in possession of Sarbali Khan. Later
on, the said gun i.e. weapon of offence was
recovered from the house of Sarbali Khan. But
for reasons best known to the prosecution the
alleged witnesses of the recovery of weapon of
offence i.e. shotgun Nisar and Sarbali Khan
have not been produced as witnesses during trial
proceedings.

13. Similarly, the version of prosecution
is not supported by medical evidence being
furnished by PW-9 Dr. Khalil-ur-Rahman who
admitted during cross-examination that this
possibility cannot be ruled out that between the

death and postmortem of the deceased 9/10

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
13

hours had been passed. But as per assertion of
the complainant in the FIR the occurrence had
taken place on 7:30 A.M early in the morning
while the report was lodged on the same day at
9:00 A.M. Likewise, the postmortem of the
deceased was carried out on 10:25 A.M, so, if
the duration between the death and postmortem
of the deceased is taken as 9/10 hours then the
occurrence might have been taken place during
dark hours of the night. This deposition of the
PW-9 during cross-examination goes against the
version of prosecution. No doubt the motive is
double edged weapon it can go in favour of
either party, yet in view of the facts and
circumstances of the present case in particular
the motive in shape of dispute over the women
folk as advanced by the complainant, the
prosecution was duty bound to prove the same,
which has not been done so through cogent and
convincing evidence.

14. Thus, it can safely be said with
certainty that the prosecution badly failed to
prove the case against the accused facing trial on

all accounts and the learned Trial Court was

Nawab (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
14

justified to pass the impugned judgment of
acquittal in favour of accused/Respondents,
which being exceptional in nature calls for no
interference by this Court.

15. It is cardinal principle of justice
which always laid emphasis on the quality of
evidence which must be of first degree and
sufficient enough to dispel the apprehension of
the Court with regard to the implication of
innocent persons alongwith guilty one by the
prosecution, otherwise, the golden principle of
justice would come into play that even a single
doubt if found reasonable would be sufficient to
acquit the accused, giving him/them benefit of
doubt because bundle of doubts are not required
to extend the legal benefit to the accused in this
regard. Reliance is placed on a view held by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
"Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. State" (NLR
1995 Cr.SC 694).

Above all, there is no cavil with the
proposition that the scope of interference in
appeal against acquittal is most narrow and

limited because in case of acquittal the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
15

presumption of innocence is significantly added
to the cardinal rule of criminal jurisprudence
that an accused shall be presumed to be innocent
unless proved guilty. Simple is that the
presumption of innocence is doubled and the
Courts shall be very slow in interfering with
such an acquittal judgment, unless it is shown to
be perverse, based on gross violation of law,
suffering from the errors of grave misreading or
non-reading of the evidence, such judgments
should not be lightly interfered and heavy
burden lies on the prosecution to rebut the
presumption of innocence which the accused has
earned and attained on account of his/their
acquittal.

The principle attributed to the appeal
against acquittal is laid down by the Hon'ble
apex Court in its landmark judgment titled as
"Ghulam Sikandar and another Vs. Mamraiz
Khan and others" (P_L D 1985 S.C.-11),
where their Lordships have ruled that:-

"In an appeal against acquittal the Supreme
Court would not on principle ordinarily
interfere and instead would give due weight
and consideration to the findings of Court
acquitting the accused. This approach is

principles of re-appraisement of evidence
will have to be kept in view when examining
the strength of the view expressed by the
court below. They will not be brushed aside
lightly on mere assumptions keeping always
in view that a departure from the normal
principle must be necessitated by obligatory
observance of some higher principle as
noted above and for no other reason.

The Court would not interfere with
acquittal merely because on re-appraisal of
the evidence it comes to the conclusion
different from that of the Court acquitting
the accused provided both the conclusions
are reasonably possible. If, however, the
conclusion reached by that Court was such
that no reasonable person would
conceivably reach the same and was
impossible then this Court would interfere
in exceptional cases on overwhelming proof

resulting in conclusive and _ irresistible
conclusion; and that too with a view only to
avoid grave miscarriage of justice and jor
no other purpose. The important test
visualized in these cases, in this behalf was
that the finding sought to be interfered with,
after scrutiny under the foregoing searching

light, should be found wholly as artificial,
shocking and ridiculous".

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

appeal against acquittal has got no force, which

is hereby dismissed accordingly.
