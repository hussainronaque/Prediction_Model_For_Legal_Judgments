JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This criminal appeal
under section 410 Cr.P.C., has been filed by Muhammad
Bilal, the appellant, against the judgment dated 29.08.2019,
of learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Juvenile
Court/MCTC, Swabi, whereby he has been convicted
under section 302 (c ) PPC and sentenced to undergo ten
(10) years rigorous imprisonment (R.I) and to pay

Rs.2,00,000/-, as compensation to legal heirs of Adil

Hussain deceased in terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in

default thereof to undergo six (06) months S.I., in case FIR
No.531 dated 31.07.2016, registered under section 302
PPC, at Police Station Kalu Khan, District Swabi. Benefit

of section 382-B Cr.P.C., has been extended to him.
2. Amjad Ali petitioner/complainant has filed Cr.R.
No.232-P/2019, seeking enhancement of sentence of the
convict/respondent from ten years R.I. to normal penalty of
death as provided for the offence.

3. Since, both the matters are emanating from one
and the same judgment of the learned trial Court dated
29.08.2019, therefore, we propose to decide the same
through this single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report (FIR) is that on 31.07.2016 at 2300
hours, complainant Amjad Ali (PW.5), in company of dead
body of his brother, namely, Adil Hussain deceased,
reported to Iftikhar Shah SI (PW.2), in casualty of civil
hospital Kalu Khan, to the effect that on that day he after
closing his shop when reached home and took meal, his
father told him that the deceased has not returned home, so
he tried to contract him on his cell phone number, but the
deceased was not responding the call. He started search for
him in the village, Bazaar and in the houses of his relative.
As he (complainant) had heard the report of fire shot,
therefore, he with the help of torch started search of the
deceased and noticed his dead body in the nearby field,
being done to death with firearm by unknown culprit (s).
Disclosing no enmity or ill will with anybody he charged
unknown culprit(s) for murder of the deceased. His report

was recorded by Iftikhar Shah SI (PW.2), in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/1 which was also verified by his uncle
Noor Jamal. PW.2 scriber of the Murasila, also prepared
injury sheet and inquest report of the deceased Exh.PM/1
and Exh.PM/2, respectively of and referred his dead body
to the mortuary where Dr. Mazhar Khan (PW.11)
conducted his postmortem examination and found a
firearm entry wound on right side forehead above eyebrow,
measuring 2 x % inches with corresponding exit wound on
the back of skull size 1x1 inch of the deceased. According
to his opinion the deceased died due to firearm injury to his
skull, brain, and membranes.

5. Mukhtaj Khan SI (PW.7) conducted investigation
in the case, who proceeded to the spot and prepared site
plan Exh.PB. During spot inspection he secured
bloodstained earth from the place of the deceased vide
recovery memo Exhs.PW.4/1. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.4/2, he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased, sent by doctor
through FC Altaf. Similarly, through recovery memo
Exh.Pw.4/3, he took into possession an empty of 30 bore
Exh.P.3 from the spot. He sent the bloodstained articles to
the FSL for opinion of the Serologist as well as the empty
for keeping it in safe custody. On 02.08.2016, he recorded
supplementary statement of complainant Amjad Ali and on
the same date, produced him before the learned Judicial

Magistrate where he recorded his statement under section
164 Cr.P.C. in which he charged the appellant. On
2.08.2016, Iftikhar Shah ASI (PW.2), arrested the appellant
along with 30 bore pistol bearing No.AF.4143 having fixed
charger, containing four live rounds of the same bore. To
this effect separate FIR was registered against the appellant
under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013. The appellant was
then handed over to the Investigation Officer (PW.7), who
obtained his physical remand. During interrogation the
appellant disclosed the recovered pistol from his
possession to be a crime weapon. He also confessed his
guilt before the I.O. therefore he was produced before the
learned Judicial Magistrate, where his confessional
statement was recorded. PW.7 sent the pistol to the FSL for
analysis with the crime empty, report whereof is
(Exh.PK/1) was received in positive.

6. On completion of investigation challan was
submitted against the appellant by Haroon Khan SHO
before the learned trial Court under the juvenile Justice
System Ordinance, where he was formally charge sheeted
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove
its case the prosecution examined as many as eight
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence,
statement of the appellant was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C., wherein he retracted his confessional
statement, denied the prosecution allegations and professed

his innocence. He, however, neither wished to be examined
on oath under section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor opted to produce
evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned
Trial Court, after hearing both the sides convicted and
sentenced the appellant, as mentioned above.

7. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their able assistance.

8. Admittedly, it is a case of no eyewitness. The dead
body of Adil Hussain deceased was found in the field of
one Faqir Ullah by the complainant, wherefrom he was
shifted to the hospital. In the initial report Exh.PA/1,
complainant (PW.5) has charged unknown culprit(s) for
murder of the deceased. After satisfaction, he on
02.08.2016 recorded his statement under section
164 Cr.P.C. before the learned Judicial Magistrate wherein
he charged the appellant for murder of the deceased and
advanced a motive behind the occurrence that deceased had
friendly relation with Iqbal Hussain (brother of appellant
Bilal) and the deceased informed Iqbal Hussain about bad
character of the appellant, on which the appellant got
annoyed. The just, fair and honest conduct of the appellant
is apparent from his statement that initially he did not
charge any innocent person. Had he any ulterior motive or
grudge with the appellant, he would have easily charged
him in the initial report. It is not disputed that the dead

body of the deceased was first seen by Amjad complainant,
who had left the house in search of his brother (deceased).
He deposed that he had heard a fire shot, therefore, in light
of the torch he proceeded towards the place wherefrom he
has perceived the sound of fire shot. He found the corpse of
his deceased brother in the field being murdered by some
unknown person with firearm. After report against
unknown culprit, there was no rumor in the area about
murder of his brother by appellant Bilal. After satisfying
himself, he (complainant) recorded his supplementary
statement wherein he charged the appellant.

9. As stated earlier it is a case of no ocular account
and the entire case of the prosecution is based on
circumstantial evidence coupled with the confessional
statement of the appellant. The appellant was arrested on
02.08.2016 by Iftikhar Shah SI (PW.2) along with 30 bore
pistol No.AF.4143 with fix charger containing 04 live
rounds of the same bore. During interrogation he confessed
his guilt before the Investigation Officer (PW.7), therefore,
on 05.08.2016 he was produced before the learned Judicial
Magistrate where he recorded his confessional statement.
Before dilating upon the voluntariness of confessional
statement of the appellant and its corroboration from other
independent circumstances coupled with the fact that
whether it has been recorded in accordance with law, we,
would like to reproduce the confessional statement of the

appellant as below:-
“Stated that some three years prior to the occurrence,

Adil Hussain had given me intoxicant in Pepsi bottle

and made my blue print/video, on the basis of which

he used to blackmail me and commit sodomy upon

me. After some period, deceased Adil told me that he

has deleted my video; however, I was having

suspicion and fear in my heart that he may not show

my video to someone. On the day of occurrence the

deceased came after me to my house, insisting for

committing sodomy upon me, but I used the artifice

and brought pistol from house and told to Bilal that I

am going to Bazaar for purchase of grocery items for

home. During this time Bilal was waiting me outside

my home. I intentionally spent more time in the

market but despite that when I reached near my

house I saw the deceased there. On his demand, it

followed him to the place of occurrence where he

opened his trouser and asked me for opening my

trouser. In the meantime, I opened fire at the

deceased. There was complete dark. My fire shot hit

the deceased who fell down and I run away from the

spot. This is my statement. The deceased did a lot to

me”.
10. The learned Judicial Magistrate while appearing as
PW.8 deposed that on 05.08.2016, the appellant was
produced before him for recording his confessional
statement. He directed the I.O, to remove his (appellant’s)

handcuffs, who accordingly removed the same. The

appellant showed his willingness to record his confessional
statement. He (PW.8) directed the police including the I.O
and Naib Court to leave the court room so as to relux the
appellant from any sort of pressure. The appellant was
given 30 minutes time to think over his confession. He
(the Magistrate), further deposed that he disclosed his
identity to the appellant and told him that he is not bound
to make a confession and if he does so it will be used
against him as evidence. The appellant was also
understood about the consequences of his confessional
statement by PW.8. The learned Judicial Magistrate further
deposed that after due satisfaction he recorded the
confessional statement of the appellant. which was read
over to the appellant and who after admitting it correct
signed/thumb impressed the same. He_ exhibited
confessional statement of the appellant as Exh.PW.8/2 and
questionnaire as Exh.PW.8/1. The learned Judicial
Magistrate (PW.8) has been subjected to lengthy and
taxing cross-examination by the defence but nothing was
brought from his mouth that confessional statement of the
appellant was the result of torture, force, coercion or
promise. In response to a question as to whether in the
confession the confessor has taken the plea of self-defence,
the learned Judicial Magistrate (PW.8) stated that since the
confessional statement is self explanatory and it would be
the learned trial Court to appreciate the same. In view of

the statement of learned Judicial Magistrate (PW.8), we are
of the considered view that confessional statement of the
appellant is voluntary and free from any sort of force,
pressure, torture, inducement and promise.

11. The confessional statement of the appellant finds
corroboration from other circumstances of the case, like
medical evidence in the shape of autopsy report of the
deceased and statement of Dr. Mazhar Khan (PW.1),
according to which the deceased has sustained solitary
firearm entry wound on right side forehead with
corresponding exit wound on back of his skull. As per
confessional statement of the appellant he fired single shot
which hit the deceased. The bloodstained earth secured
from the spot from the place of the deceased and his last
worn bloodstained garments were sent to the FSL, report
of the Serologist in respect thereof is in positive. Single
crime empty of 30 bore pistol was recovered from the spot
which was sent to the FSL for safe custody. The appellant
was arrested on 02.08.2016 by Iftikhar Shah SI (PW.2) and
a 30 bore pistol No.AF.4143 was recovered from his
possession which was sent to the FSL for comparison with
the crime empty already sent to the FSL. Report of the FSL
in this regard Exh.PZ is in positive. In this view of the
matter, the medical evidence as well as the above
mentioned pieces of circumstantial evidence corroborates

the confessional statement of the appellant.

12. No doubt, the appellant has retracted his
confessional statement in his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C., but it is settled law that conviction of an accused
can be recorded on the basis of retracted judicial
confessional if the same was proved voluntary, true and
corroborated by other strong circumstances of the case.
Mere denial of accused in his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C. that confessional was not voluntary or that he has
not made such statement would not make his confessional
statement inadmissible. As per ratio of judgment of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled, “Manjeet Singh Vs
the State” (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 30), retracted
confession either judicial or extra-judicial, if found truthful
and confidence inspiring as well as qualified the test of
voluntariness, can be used for conviction without looking
for any other sort of corroboration. In the judgment supra
the Hon’ble Supreme Court while dilating upon the
evidentiary value of the retracted confession held that no
rule of criminal administration of justice existed to the
effect that the court having found the retracted confession
voluntary and true must look for the corroboration and that
in absence of corroborative evidence, conviction cannot be
maintained. Retraction of a Judicial or extra-judicial
confession itself is not an infirmity to be considered
sufficient to withhold the conviction, because evidentiary

value of a confession is not diminished by the mere fact
11

that it was retracted by the maker at the trial. Independent
corroboration from other sources direct or circumstantial,
therefore, cannot be insisted in every case as a mandatory
rule, rather the rule of corroboration is applied by way of
abundant caution and in a case depending entirely on the
confessional statement of a person or only on the
circumstantial evidence, and this rule is applied more
cautiously.

13. Deriving wisdom from the judgment (supra) of the
august Supreme court, we entertain no amount of doubt in
mind to hold that the confessional statement of the
appellant being voluntary is fully corroborated by strong
circumstances discussed above and has rightly been based
by the learned trial Court for holding the appellant guilty
of the offence to which no exception can be taken.

14. Now the moot question for determination is the
quantum of sentence to be awarded to the appellant so as
to meet the ends of justice. Admittedly, the appellant was a
Juvenile at the time of occurrence. It is settled principle of
criminal jurisprudence that whenever prosecution is
relying on solitary confessional statement of an accused
and there is no direct evidence then the confessional
statement of accused is to be accepted or rejected in
whole/toto. However, where direct and circumstantial
evidence is available besides the confessional statement of

accused in that eventuality, the portion of confessional
12

statement which supports the version of prosecution would
be taken into consideration, whereas other portion of
confessional statement which is inconsistent with it would
not be taken into account. Guidance in this regard can be

derived from case, titled, “Gana Ram versus the State”

(1999 P Cr L J 490) and “Ajab Khan vs the State (1995
MLD 1190).

15. At the touch stone of the aforesaid principle if the
confessional statement of the appellant is taken into
consideration in toto then one thing is clear then crystal
that the appellant has committed the offence to save
himself from the sexual assault of the appellant. The
deceased was constantly harassing the appellant and on the
day of occurrence he was bent upon to commit sodomy
upon the appellant. He (the deceased) compelled the
appellant for subjecting him to the act of sodomy.
According to confessional statement of the appellant, the
deceased was persistently blackmailing the appellant and
the appellant had even made a complaint to brother of the
deceased about sodomitical character.

16. From the peculiar facts and circumstances of the
case coupled with the confessional statement of the
appellant, we are of the considered view that the appellant
has committed murder of the deceased to defend himself

from sexual and blackmailing by the deceased. However,
13

the appellant by selecting vital part of body of the deceased
i.e. skull has exceeded the right of self defence.

17. In such eventuality the petitioner by taking shelter
under section 100 PPC cannot be acquitted out rightly,
rather, keeping in view juvenility of the appellant and the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, ten years
rigorous imprisonment already awarded to the appellant by
the learned trial Court is just and appropriate.

18. Accordingly, the appeal of the appellant and the
criminal revision filed by the petitioner/complainant being
meritless are hereby dismissed.
