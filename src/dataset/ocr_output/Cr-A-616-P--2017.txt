LUDGMENT
MUSARRAT HILAL J.- This criminal appeal is

directed against the judgment dated 16.09.2017, rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge, Juvenile
Court, Camp Court, Lahor, District Swabi, whereby the
accused-appellant was convicted under section 302(b)
PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life with
compensation of Rs. 5,00,000/-, payable to the legal heirs
of the deceased, or in default thereof to undergo further
six months S] with benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.

2. Concise facts of the instant criminal appeal as
reflected from the record are that on 21.12.2014, Noor
Taj Ali lodged a report to the police in RHC, Yar
Hussain, to the effect that on the eventful day, he

along with his brothers Arshad Ali and Farhad Ali was
present in his house, when at'11.00 hours heard a report
of fire shot, upon which they rushed to the Hujra where
found his son Asim lying in a pool of blood, while
Faroog (the appellant) armed with pistol was running
from the Hujra. He further stated in his report that Asim
and Farooq were class fellows and studying in Yar
Hussain model School. Motive for the offence was that
few days prior to the occurrence exchange of hot words
were taken place between them. Shoukat Hussain Khan
SI (PW-5) recorded report of the complainant in shape of
Murasilla, on the basis of which, the present case FIR
No. 515, dated 21.12.2014, under section 302 PPC was
registered at Police Station, Yar Hussain.

3. After completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted against the accused-appellant to the Court
of learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Camp Court
Lahor, Swabi. Since the accused-appellant was below the
age of eighteen years, therefore, his case was tried by
Judge, Juvenile Court, where at the commencement of
trial, the prosecution produced nine (09) witnesses. On
closure of the prosecution evidence, accused-appellant
was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he

describing himself as scape-goat, denied the charges,
3 /

professed innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case. He, however, wished to produce
no defence nor wanted to examine himself on oath as
required under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On conclusion of
the trial, the learned trial Court convicted and sentenced
the appellant, as mentioned above, vide judgment dated
06.09.2017, the legality and validity of which has been
challenged by the appellant through the instant criminal
appeal. Noor Taj Ali, the complainant, has also filed a
criminal revision No. 129-P/2017 for enhancement of
the sentence. Since both the criminal appeal and criminal
revision have been filed against one and same judgment,
therefore, we propose to dispose of the same through this
single judgment.

4. Learned counsel for the convict-appellant
contended that the prosecution has fabricated the first
information report on which no reliance should have
been placed by the learned trial court; that neither there
is eyewitness to the alleged occurrence nor the motive as
alleged by the prosecution has been proved; that
complainant and PW-8 being closely related to the
deceased are interested witnesses, therefore, their

testimony cannot be relied upon; that an empty .12 bore
allegedly recovered from the spot did not match the .12
bore pistol, which aspect of the case further makes the
story of prosecution doubtful; further that the prosecution
has badly failed to prove its case against the appellant by
producing reliable and independent evidence; that the
learned trial Court has not scrutinized the evidence of
prosecution witnesses in accordance with recognized
principles of appreciation of evidence available on
record, rather based its judgment on the basis of
conjecture and surmises, therefore, the impugned
judgment is against the law and without any cogent
evidence, as such, the same is liable to be set aside and
the appellant be acquitted of the charge.

5. As against that learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant argued that the evidence
furnished by the complainant and eyewitness (PW-8) is
not liable to be questioned on any ground because same
are candid and honest by stating the fact what they have
seen on the spot, despite the fact that they could have
exaggerated their statements; that the appellant is the
single accused, who is charged directly in the promptly
lodged FIR by name and that the ocular account is

corroborated by the medical evidence as well as strong
circumstantial evidence; that the occurrence took place in
broad day light and the appellant is also co-villager of the
complainant party, therefore, question of mis-
identification or false charge is also out of consideration;
that the convict-appellant has committed the brutal
murder of a boy, below the age of eighteen years;
therefore, deserves no leniency and his sentence may be
enhanced to death.

6. We have considered the arguments advanced by
learned counsel for the parties and the State and gone
through the entire record with their valuable assistance.

7. The homicidal death of deceased Asim, aged about
thirteen years, has been established from the P.M
documents as well as statements of PW-6 Dr. Muddasir
Iqbal. According to his opinion, the death of the deceased
had occurred due to injuries to brain and membrane,
caused by firearm. The question as to whether it was the
appellant, who had committed the murder of the deceased
Asim or otherwise is concerned, perusal of the record
would reveal that the appellant has been charged by
complainant Noor Taj Ali (PW-7) in a promptly lodged
report within forty-five minutes, which ruled out the

possibility of deliberations or consultations, as the
occurrence took place on 21.12.2014 at 1100 hours,
while the report was lodged by him at 11.45 hours. The
complainant appeared as PW-7 and gave details of the
occurrence by supporting the contents of FIR. According
to his statement, he was present in his house along with
his brothers Irshad Ali and Farhad Ali when at 1100
hours heard report of fire shot, upon which they rushed to
the Hujra where he found his son Asim in a pool of blood .
while appellant armed with pistol was seen by them
running from the Hujra. His testimony was also
supported by Irshad Ali (PW-08), who is uncle of the
deceased, and furnished the details of unfortunate
incident. He fully explained his presence on the spot. As
per site plan, points of complainant and Irshad Ali (PW-
8) were close to the place of deceased and they on
hearing the report of fire shot sharply went out from the
house and attracted the appellant armed with pistol while
running from the spot, therefore, keeping in view the
relationship with the deceased and their residence, their
presence at the scene of incident cannot be doubted.
There is no cavil to the proposition that in such
like criminal cases, the whole fate depends on the

authenticity of the ocular account and in the instant case,
both the eye-witnesses have given an honest and
straightforward account of the occurrence of murder of
deceased. They could have exaggerated the story by
stating that the deceased was fired at in their presence but
instead they gave a confidence inspiring testimony by
stating that they at the time of occurrence had seen the
appellant duly armed with pistol running from the spot.
Even otherwise, it is not expected from such close
relationship i.e. real father and paternal uncle of the
deceased, that they would let the real offender of their
teenage loved one, go scot-free and would falsely
implicate the present appellant. Rel: (PLD_ 2001
Supreme Court 222). Both the PWs remained stuck to
their statements and nothing material was brought on
record to create uncertainty in their evidence in spite of
lengthy examination. Therefore, on thorough scrutiny
and appraisal of record, their un-impeached versions are
apparently truthful and confidence inspiring.

8. No doubt, both the star witnesses of the
prosecution are relative of the deceased but it is settled
law by now that interested witness is the one who has an
animosity for false charge and mere relationship of a

witness to the deceased is not enough to discard his
testimony. The defence has also failed to bring on record
an iota of evidence to prove any ulterior motive of the
complainant and PW-8 to falsely implicate the appellant.
Hon’ble the apex Court in number of cases has held that
statement of a witness cannot be disbelieved solely on the
plea that he is related to the deceased when there is no
motive to falsely implicate the accused. Rel: Sheeraz

Tufail v. The State (2007 SCMR 518). Same principle

was also reiterated in the case titled Muhammad Amin
ys. the State (2000 S C M R 1784) wherein Hon’ble the
apex court has held that friendship or relationship with
the deceased is not sufficient to discredit a witness
particularly when there is no motive to falsely involve the
accused. The general rule for appreciation of evidence as
held by the apex court in a case titled Haroon alias
Haroni_ vs the State (1995 SCMR 1627) is that the
statement of a witness must be in consonance with the
probabilities, fitting in the circumstances of the case and
also inspire confidence in the mind of a reasonable
prudent man and if these elements are present, then the
statement of worst enemy of an accused may be accepted
and relied upon without corroboration. Viewing the

testimony of these witnesses in the light of aforesaid
a)

criteria, we do not find their testimony as tainted or they
had any motive to falsely implicate the appellant nor any
enmity worth the name has been brought on record to
show that they were implicating the appellant-convict in
the case falsely, thus, in view of the above discussed
reasons, we are satisfied that the evidence of complainant
and Irshad Ali (PW-8) was rightly relied by the trial
court.

9. As is evident from the record that it was a day light
occurrence and appellant was already known to
complainant and PW-8 being their co-villager, therefore,
no question of misidentification arises. The case of
prosecution has further been supported by the P.M
documents as well as recovery of an empty of 12 bore,
blood stained earth from the spot, blood stained garments
of the deceased and discovery of .12 bore pistol as
weapon of offence at pointation of the appellant.

10. Learned counsel for the appellant, no doubt,
pointed out certain discrepancies in the statements of
prosecution witnesses but the same being minor in nature
are of no consequences. Besides, the discrepancies as
pointed out by the defence are bound to occur even in the

statements of truthful and honest witnesses due to lapse
Cl

10

of time, therefore, in presence of such discrepancies the
prosecution case cannot be thrown overboard. As far as
FSL report of a 12 bore empty with the pistol recovered
on pointation of accused-appellant is concerned, there
can be no implication of the said report on the instant
case as no opinion was formed by the expert. The
argument of learned defence counsel that the motive is
far away from being established on record has also no
force as it has now been settled by the august apex court
in a case titled Muhammad Hayat vs. the State ( 1996
SCMR_ 1411) that absence of motive or failure of the
prosecution to prove it does not adversely affect the
testimony of the eye-witnesses, if they are otherwise
reliable.

11. For the aforementioned reasons, we are fully
satisfied that the prosecution has succeeded in
establishing the guilt of the appellant. The judgment of
conviction and sentences passed against the appellant is
based on correct appreciation of evidence on record and
there is nothing to indicate that it is either based on any
error of law or the same is different to well-established
principles of judicial approach or the same can in any

manner be characterized as unjustified. Therefore, the
11

judgment of conviction and sentences recorded by the
trial Court is maintained and this appeal being without
merit is hereby dismissed.

13, As far as quantum of sentence to the appellant is
concemed, he being child below age of eighteen years as
defined under section 2(b) of Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2018, and under section 16 of the Act, no
person who was a juvenile offender at the time of
commission of an offence shall be awarded punishment
of death, therefore, criminal revision No. 129-P/2017 for

enhancement of sentence is also dismissed.
