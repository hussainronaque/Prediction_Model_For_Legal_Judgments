Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This appeal is directed against the judgment, dated

iv. Under section 337-D PPC, to payment of Arsh
ie. Rs.925784.33 as one-third of Diyat
Rs.2777353/-, payable to victim Kaleem Ullah,
along with 05 years imprisonment as Ta’azir.

v. Under section 337-F(ili) PPC, to payment of
Rs.30,000/- as Daman to victim Nasir Khan,
along with 02 years imprisonment as Ta’azir.

The sentences were ordered to run
concurrently. The benefit under section 382-B
Cr.P.C was also extended.

2. Facts shortly are that on 25.09.2001, at 17:00 hours, the
complainant Gul Shah Din, in Emergency Ward of Civil
Hospital Teri, reported that on the eventful day, at 16:00 hours,
he, along with Khwaza Din, Muhammad Azam, Noor Saeed
Khan, Kaleem Ullah, Nasir, Mst. Amtara Bibi, Rozi Gul, Sadiq
Noor and Abdul Janan, after attending Court proceedings, were
proceeding back home in a Datsun pickup driven by Bahader
Khan. When they reached the spot, accused Nek Din, Habib,
Nasim, Laal Mir, and Ashraf started firing at them with
murderous intention. As a result of firing of accused Nek Din
and Laal Mir, Abdul Janan was hit and died on the spot, while
the firing of accused Nek Din caused Nasir firearm injuries.
Similarly, from the firing of co-accused Habib and Nasim,
Khwaza Din, Noor Saeed and Kaleem Ullah sustained injuries.
Likewise, from the firing of co-accused Ashraf Khan, the driver
Bahader Khan wounded and his Datsun pickup also got
damaged. The accused after the commission of the offence
decamped from the spot. Motive for the offence was disclosed

as the elopement of Mst. Amtara Bibi by Moeen-ud-Din.

3. Initially, all the accused went into hiding. After

completion of investigation, complete challan under section 173
Page - 3 - of 8

Cr.P.C was submitted against them for proceedings under
section 512 Cr.P.C. Later, accused / appellant Nek Din was
arrested on 18.01.2016. It followed the arrests of co-accused /
appellants Laal Mir on 08.02.2016 and Habib Ullah on
13.12.2016. Their supplementary challans were submitted
before the trial Court. All of them were charge sheeted on
23.01.2017, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
On conclusion of trial, they were convicted and sentenced vide
judgment, dated 04.01.2018. On appeal, it was set aside on the
ground that the charge was defective as far as the conviction of
the accused / appellant Habib Ullah under section 302 PPC was
concerned. It is worth noting that he was not charged for the
murder of the deceased Abdul Janan, but was charge sheeted
and convicted for the murder. The case was, thus, remanded to
the trial Court for retrial from the stage of the charge to be
framed freshly against the appellants for the offences of
-murderous assault and causing injuries to the injured vide

judgment, dated 10.12.2018 in Criminal Appeal No.12-B/2018.

4. Regarding murder, a compromise effected between the
parties. So, on 11.01.2019, the trial Court proceeded to frame
the charge under sections 324 / 337-A(ii) / 337-D / 337-F(iii) /
337-F(v) / 427 / 148 / 149 PPC, to which the appellants pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. On conclusion of the de novo trial,
vide the impugned judgment, dated 16.01.2021, the appellants
were yet again convicted and sentenced, as mentioned above.

Hence, this appeal.

5. We have given our anxious consideration to the

arguments addressed at the bar and perused the record.

6. Record shows that in the previous trial, the charge was

defective in the sense that the appellant Habib Ullah was not
Page - 4 - of 8

charged for the murder of the deceased Abdul Janan. However,
he was charge sheeted and convicted by the trial Court under
section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment vide its
judgment, dated 23.01.2017. It was because of this reason, that
this Court vitiated the trial in appeal and while invoking the
provisions of section 232 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898
(“the Code”), the case was remanded for the retrial from the
stage of the charge to be framed for the murderous assault and
the injuries caused to the injured vide judgment, dated
10.12.2018. Though, the trial Court framed the charge afresh as
directed and concluded the trial as well. However, it allowed
some of the material witnesses to rely on their statements
recorded in the previous trial. It also concurred with the learned
counsel for the defence to rely on the cross-examinations of
such witnesses recorded in the previous trial. In this regard, the
statements of complainant Gul Shah Din (PW-01), Rozi Gul
(PW-02), Mst. Amtara Bibi (PW-03), Nasir Khan (PW-04), and
Noor Saeed Khan (PW-05) are worth perusal. The trial Court,
thus, did not record the statements of these witnesses afresh.
Even it left the partial cross-examination of PW-01 unsigned
and, thus, the same cannot be termed as evidence in legal
parlance. It read the evidence of the above said witnesses,
recorded in the previous trial, as evidence in the de novo trial.
Hence, before we proceed to embark upon the merits of the
case, it is deemed appropriate to determine the pivotal question
as to whether the trial Court acted in accordance with law or not
to read the evidence recorded in the previous trial as evidence

in the de novo trial.

7. Chapters XIX and XXII-A of the Code are relevant. They
provide a complete mechanism regarding the charge, the

procedure, and the steps to be followed in the conduct of a full-
C

Page - 5 - of 8

fledged trial. Those also encompass the effect of addition,
alteration and/or reframing of charge and the procedure to be
followed. Section 231 thereof relates to recalling of witnesses
when the charge is altered, whereas section 232 confers upon
this Court the power to direct for a ‘new trial’ where the charge
is defective. Section 265-F of the Code relates to evidence for
prosecution where the accused does not plead guilty or the
Court, in its discretion, does not convict him on his plea.

Section 232 ibid is the most relevant provision which reads:

232. Effect of material error. (1) If any Appellate
Court or the High Court, or the Court of Session in
the exercise of its powers of revision or under
Chapter XVII, is of opinion that any person
convicted of an offence was misled in his defence
by the absence of a charge or by any error in the
charge, it shall direct a new trial to be held upon a
charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit.

(2) If the Court is of the opinion that the
facts of the case are such that no valid charge
could be preferred against the accused in respect of

(Underline is ours for emphasis)

& the facts provide, it shall quash the conviction.
8

The above cited provision of law makes it clear that in
the case of an error in the charge which prejudiced the accused,
convicted of an offence, the Court shall direct a ‘new trial’ to be
held upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit. As
noted above, the charge in the previous trial was defective
which prejudiced the appellant Habib Ullah in the sense that he
was convicted under section 302(b) without being charged for
the murder. So, this Court under the mandate of section 232 of
the Code directed a retrial to be conducted after the charge is
framed afresh. Needless to mention, the retrial in the context of

this section was a new and/or a de novo trial. It is imperative to
AN

Page - 6 - of 8

state that in the simplest term, the word de novo as per the
Black's Law Dictionary (9" Edition) p 500 means “a new”.
Similarly, as per the Mitra’s Legal Dictionary (6" Edition) p
227, it means “new or fresh”. It would also not be out of place

to mention its Urdu meaning as well, which, as per the Oxford
English Urdu Dictionary (p 404), means “<<, &”. In this

perspective, once the charge was framed afresh and when the
previous trial was vitiated as is explicitly evident from para-9 of
the above said judgment of this Court, then, of course the trial
court was left with no other option, but to examine the PWs
afresh as if they were not examined at all, and to adopt the
procedure as adumbrated in Chapter XXII-A of the Code. In the
circumstances, the trial court, while reading the evidence
recorded in the previous trial as evidence in the de novo trial,
committed gross illegality and acted beyond the realm of law.

In somewhat similar circumstances, the Lahore High Court, in

Zafrullah and others v. The State (1972 PCr.LJ 734 Lahore),

observed:

6. In my view, the evidence recorded in the
previous trial could not be read as evidence in the
present case even under any of the provisions of
the Evidence Act. The previous statements made in
the same case or at a previous stage of a same case
are relevant if a witness is not to be found for
reasons mentioned in section 33 of the Evidence
Act, but there is no section of the Evidence Act
which says that a previous statement made in the
first trial can be used as a substantive evidence in
the second trial. It was held in Jn re: K. K. Umar
Haji and others that the transfer of a statement of a
witness made at the previous trial during the
proceedings of the de novo trial without the
witness having been examined de novo, was a
procedure which vitiated the trial notwithstanding
the consent of the accused to the adoption of such
Page - 7 - of 8

a procedure.

9. Additionally, if the instant case is considered on the
touchstone of Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984—which is pari materia to section 33 of the repealed
Evidence Act, 1872 as aforesaid—even then it does not become
justified, as the conditions precedent for the purpose were not
fulfilled either. Needless to mention, all these witnesses were
alive. They were found and capable of giving evidence. In the
case of Ali Akbar v. The State (PLD 1997 Karachi 146), it was

observed:

Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
prescribes the conditions under which secondary
evidence of the testimony of a witness in the
former proceeding, civil or criminal, is admissible
in subsequent proceeding or in a later stage of the
same proceeding where the question in controversy
in both proceedings is identical and where the
witness is dead or cannot be found or is incapable
of giving evidence. Before such evidence could be
made admissible, the following conditions are
necessary to be complied with:

Z [...]

(v) That the witness is incapable of being called
at the subsequent proceeding on account of
death, or incapability of giving evidence or
being kept out of the way by the other side
or_an_unreasonable amount of delay or
expenses.

15. It is noted that above are conditions precedent
before a previous deposition could be admitted for
consideration. Absence of any one of them would
not attract said Article nor was there compulsion to
straight away believe such deposition if rightly or
wrongly brought on record.

10. In our considered view, the procedure adopted by the
trial Court, being incurable, has prejudiced the appellants in
their defence and thereby it caused miscarriage of justice which
runs in conflict with the concept of fair trial in the context of
Article 10A of the Constitution. Needless to mention, the
concept of fair trial is not just a right provided in our country,
but a right internationally guaranteed through numerous
Constitutions and Declarations all over the world. Reference,
for example, may be made to Article 10 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, Article 6 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the
African Charter of Human Rights, and Articles 102-108 of the
1949 Third Geneva Convention.

11. For these reasons, the question formulated is answered in
the negative. Consequently, the impugned judgment, dated
06.01.2021, is set aside. The case is remanded to the trial Court
for a de novo trial with the directions to re-summon the
prosecution witnesses for examination with regard to the charge
framed as per the directions of this Court and provide the
appellants an opportunity of cross-examination in accordance
with law. The trial shall be concluded and the case decided on
merit as expeditiously as possible since the matter has turned an
oldest one. As the appellants have been released on bail by this
Court vide order dated 11.05.2022, therefore, they shall be

deemed to be on bail during the trial.
