Mr. Alam Sher Khan Bozdar, advocate for the applicant.
Mr. Shafi Muhammad Mahar, Deputy P.G General.

On conclusion of trial, the applicant was convicted u/s 489-F PPC
and sentenced to undergo R.I for three years with fine of Rs. 25,000/- and
in default whereof to undergo simple imprisonment for three months with
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C by learned Ist Judicial Magistrate/ MTMC
Mirpur Mathelo vide judgment dated 31-01-2023, which he impugned by
preferring an appeal, it was dismissed by learned 1st Additional Sessions
Judge Mirpur Mathelo vide judgment dated 07-03-2023, which he has
impugned before this Court by preferring the instant Crl. Revision
Application. In the meanwhile by way of listed application has sought for
his release on bail by suspending the operation of impugned judgment.

It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the
aggregate sentence with fine awarded to the applicant being three years is
short one; the applicant inclusive of remission has already undergone two
years of the sentence and disposal of his Revision Application is likely to
take time on account of heavy pendency; therefore, the applicant is
entitled to be released on bail by suspending the operation of impugned
sentence, which is not opposed by learned DPG for the State.

Heard arguments and perused the record.

In view of above, while relying upon the case of Makhdoom Javed
Hashmi Vs. The State (2007 SCMR 1844), the operation of impugned
sentence is suspended and the applicant is directed to be released on bail,
subject to his furnishing surety in sum of Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One lac)
and PR bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of Additional Registrar
of this Court.

The listed application is disposed of accordingly.

Adjourned to be fixed after three weeks for hearing of main
Revision Application.
