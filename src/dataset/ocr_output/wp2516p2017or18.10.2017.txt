W.P.No.2516-P/2017

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J-. Through the instant constitutional

petition, the petitioner has sought the following relief:-
It is, therefore, respectfully prayed that on
acceptance of this writ petition, this Hon'ble Court
_may graciously be pleased to declare the impugned

order dated 17.05.2017 as_ illegal, without

jurisdiction, without lawful authority and the case
of the petitioner may kindly be remanded back to

the trial court to be decided on merits.

2. Briefly stated the facts of the case are that the

petitioner filed a complaint u/s % of the Illegal Dispossession Act

9.15 a.m. the respondents entered into his house and forcibly took

away the entire household articles alongwith gold ornaments and

possession of the house; that the respondents are accused in case

~~
FIR Nos.58, 239, 313 and 312 and are at large in the said cases,

but the local police is avoiding to arrest them; that the
complainant approached the high up of the police officials for
redressal of his grievance but all his efforts in this respect proved

to be a wild goose chase, and as such prayed for proceedings

against the respondents in accordance with law. The complaint

was lodged on 27.3.2013. The SHO Police Station, Mattani was

| directed to inquire into the matter and to submit

comments/inquiry report. The inquiry report was submitted in the
court, wherein, it was stated that both the parties are absconders

and it was dangerous to proceed to the spot and no report was.

{submitted in respect of illegal dispossession of the

complainant/petitioner. After receipt of the inquiry report, process
was issued against the accused. Accused Nasim Akhtar attended

the court who was formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded

| not guilty and claimed trial. Lateron he absented himself and

proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C. were initiated against him.

All the accused were declared as proclaimed offenders and

| perpetual warrants of arrest were issued against them vide order

dated 14.3.2015. After arrest of the accused Akhtar Nawab/
respondent, the complainant submitted an application on

14.10.2012 before the learned ASJ-IV, Peshawar praying therein

| for commencement of trial as such formal charge was framed

against him on 10,3.2016 to which he pleaded not guilty and

| claimed trial. During trial, the learned counsel for accused submitted an

application u/s 265-K Cr.P.C., notice whereof was issued to the
complainant and after hearing the learned counsel for the parties,
the leaned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Peshawar accepted the
application and acquitted the accused vide order dated 17.5.2017,
hence this petition.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the
findings and observation given by the learned court below are
illegal. He next argued that the case of the petitioner falls outside
the ambit of Section 403 Cr.P.C. therefore, warrant interference.
4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Perusal of the record reveals that earlier, the

petitioner had lodged a case vide FIR No.504 dated 22.8.2010

| registered under sections 380/452/427/148/149 PPC at the order

of learned Justice of Peace, against the respondents for the same
incident as narrated in the complaint. The trial was conducted in
that very FIR, wherein, complainant appeared as PW-1 and the
accused/respondents were acquitted by the learned Judicial
Magistrate vide order dated 02.03.2017, which was upheld by this

court. The respondent was acquitted from the charges leveled in

| the FIR, which are same as mentioned in the complaint, therefore,

his trial on the same allegations is hit by embargo placed by
section 403 Cr.P.C. which is reproduced below:-

Section-403, Persons once convicted or acquitted
not to be tried for the same offence. (1) A person
who has once been tried by a Court of competent
jurisdiction for an offence and convicted or

acquitted of such offence shall, while such

a

conviction or acquittal remains in force, not to be
liable to be tried again for the same offence, nor
on the same facts for any other offence for which
a different charge from the one made against him
might have been made under section 236, or for
which he might have been convicted under
section 237.

(2) A person acquitted or convicted for any
offence may be afterwards tried for any district
offence for which a separate charge might have
been made against him on the former trial under
section 235, subsection (1).

(3) A person convicted of any offence
constituted by any act causing consequences
which together with such act, constituted a
different offence from that of which he was
convicted, may be afterwards tried for such last-
mentioned offence, if the consequence had not
happened or were not happened, or were not
known to the Court to have happened, at the time
when he was convicted.

(4) A person acquitted or convicted of any
offence constituted by any acts may,
notwithstanding such acquittal or conviction, be
subsequently charged with, and tried for any other
offence constituted by the same acts which he
may have committed if the Court by which he was
first tried was not competent to try the offence

with which he is subsequently charged.

(5) Nothing in this section shall affect the
provision of section 26 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897, or section 188 of this Code.

dd

Section 403 contemplates of a situation where a person has once
| been tried by a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted by

Shahid Ali,P.S

such court cannot be tried again for the same offence nor for any.
other offence based on similar facts. In this respect, reliance can
well be made on the case of Shehr Yar Vs. Bacha and 4 others

(1997 MLD page-1672), it is held that:-

Section 403, Cr.P.C. contemplates of a

situation where a person having once been

tried by a Court of competent’ jurisdiction
and acquitted by such Court cannot be tried
again for the same offence nor for any other

offence based on similar facts.

|6. . For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the learned
| trial court has rightly acquitted the accused u/s 265-K Cr.P.C. as
there was no probability of his being convicted. We find no
irregularity or illegality in the impugned judgment, therefore, the
| same is maintained. The writ petition, being bereft of merit, is

dismissed in limine.

Announced.
