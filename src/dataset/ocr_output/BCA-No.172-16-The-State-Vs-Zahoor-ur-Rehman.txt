Respondent: Zahoor-ur-Rahman by Mr.

KKK

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- The State through Advocate

General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar has filed the present
petition for cancellation of bail granted to the respondent/
accused namely, Zahoor-ur-Rahman alias Zahoor by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat vide order dated

16.9.2016 in case F.I.R 236 dated 31.3.2016 registered under

Imran P.S/*
-2-

Sections 324/148/149 PPC at Police Station Lakki, District

Lakki Marwat.

2. The case of prosecution as narrated in the FIR is

that on 31.3.2016 at 2015 hours, complainant Moalim Khan

was present in his baithak when the accused Shaista Khan,

Zahoor (respondent), Wali and Zakria duly armed with

Kalashnikovs came there and caught hold of him and forcibly

started ousting the complainant from the baithak but on his hue

and cry, his brother Feroz Khan came out of the house and in

the meanwhile the accused started firing due to which the

complainant and his brother Feroz Khan got hit and sustained

injuries, hence, the respondent/accused alongwith others were

booked in the ibid F.I.R.

3. Learned Addl: A.G. for the State contended that

the respondent/accused was directly charged alongwith his co-

accused for causing firearm injuries to the complainant and PW

Feroz Khan. The crime empties have been recovered from the

places of accused and in this respect Firearms Expert Report

fully supports the prosecution case. The MLCs and the FSL

report regarding bloodstained articles also support the case of

Imran P.S/*

prosecution. The learned Court below released the respondent/

accused on bail on erroneous and petty grounds and if the bail

granting order dated 16.9.2016 is remained intact in the field, it

will highly damage the prosecution case during course of trial.

4. On the other hand, learned counsel for the

respondent/accused contended that once the bail is granted to

an accused by a Court of competent jurisdiction it is normally

not interfered with, unless the bail granting order is found

patently illegal, erroneous, or the concession of bail was

misused or tamper the evidence, to obstruct the course of fair

investigation, resulting into miscarriage of justice; he further

argued that there is nothing on record, whatsoever, which

would show that the respondent/accused after his release on

bail has misused or abused the concession; that there is no

likelihood of tampering with the prosecution or abscontion of

the respondent/accused.

5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and

have gone through the record.

6. The grounds prevailed before the learned

Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat for granting of bail

Imran P.S/*
-4-

to respondent/accused and rendered in the impugned order are

that it is a case of further inquiry. The relevant portion of the

impugned order is as follows:-

"Having heard the detail arguments of
learned counsels for both the parties and
after going through the record of the case
file, undeniably, general role of firing has
been attributed to all the four accused on the
person of complainant and his brother co
injured. As per contents of site plan, the role
of firing on the person of injured-
complainant has been restricted to the extent
of accused/petitioner as well as his co
accused namely Shaista Khan. On_ the
application of co accused Shaista Khan, the
LO of the case after thorough probe has
declared him innocent for his non
availability at the scene of occurrence at the
relevant time. This situation leads to the
formation of a counter version which is yet
to be ascertained at the stage of trial that
which of the version rings true so as to
establish the independent liability of each of
the party. Consequently without commenting
upon the further merits of the case, on this
score alone, the case of the present
accuse/petitioner also becomes one of

further inquiry"

Imran P.S/*

7. Declaration of innocence by police otherwise is

not relevant factor alone, and that too, of co-accused, which

would hardly have any bearing on the case of other co-accused

and against whom the Court has to see a prima facie case. In

view of this Court plea of alibi of an accused would not entitle

the co-accused for grant of bail as a matter of right. Reliance is

placed on case titled, ‘Muhammad Azam Vs. The State’ (1990

SCMR 1319).

8. The record reveals that subsection (2) of section

497, Cr.P.C. has not been properly appreciated by the learned

Judge. It is settled law that the expression "further inquiry" is

not to be taken lightly nor is to be entertained unnecessarily.

Reference is made to PLD 1990 SC 83. In the case of ‘Arbab

Ali vy. Khamiso and others’ (1985 SCMR 195), it was observed

by apex Court "There are certain other features also in this

case which have not been attended in the High Court before

giving a verdict that it was a case of "further inquiry". It needs

to be clarified that bail can be allowed in a case otherwise

allegedly falling under the prohibition contained in subsection

(1) of section 497 under subsection (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C.,

Imran P.S/*
-6-

when there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into the

guilt of the accused but only on the condition when the Police

Officer or the Court at any stage of investigation, inquiry or

trial, as the case may be, comes to a definite conclusion that

there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the accused

had committed a non-bailable offence. Without this finding bail

cannot be allowed under subsection (2) on mere ground that

there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry. This aspect of

the relevant law has also not been brought to the notice of the

learned Judge of the High Court."

9. The most pivotal question which arises at this

juncture is whether this Court would be justified to cancel the

bail granted to the respondent/accused by Court of competent

jurisdiction under section 497(5), Cr.P.C.? Cancellation of bail

is a hard order, because it interferes with the liberty of an

individual, hence, it must not be resorted to lightly. Rejection of

bail when bail is applied for is one thing and cancellation of

bail when granted is another, because cancellation of bail

interferes with the liberty already secured by the accused either

on the exercise of discretion by the Court, or by thrust of law.

Imran P.S/*
-7-

Hence, power to take back in custody, an accused who has been

enlarged on bail is to be exercised with care and circumstances.

That does not mean that power though extraordinary in

character must not be exercised even if the ends of justice so

demand, and in this case, it is being exercised in favour of the

petitioner.

10. In this case, the respondent/accused along with

other co-accused had come to the baithak of the complainant

while duly armed with Kalashnikovs and started firing due to

which the complainant and PW Feroz Khan got hit and

sustained injuries. The complainant had promptly lodged F.LR.

wherein a total of four persons have been charged by name for

commission of offence. The empties have been recovered from

the spot and to that effect the report of Firearms Expert fully

supports the case of prosecution. Both the parties are well

known to each other so question of mistaken identity does not

arise. Therefore, the respondent/accused is prima facie

connected with the commission of offence and the impugned

order dated 16.9.2016 is patently illegal, factually incorrect and

perverse which has resulted in miscarriage of justice.

Imran P.S/*

11. Consequently this petition is accepted and the
impugned order impugned dated 16.9.2016, passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat is set aside and
bail granted to the respondent/accused is hereby cancelled. He
is present in Court and be taken into custody forthwith and be
sent to judicial lock-up.
12. Above are detailed reasons of my short order of the
even date.

Announced.
