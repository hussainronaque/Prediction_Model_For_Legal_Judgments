JUDGMENT

Respondent...

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Niaz Khan,

accused/petitioner, is seeking post arrest
bail on statutory ground of delay in
conclusion of trial in case vide FIR No.343
dated 03.07.2011 under Section 302 PPC
read with Section 34 PPC registered in
Police Station Saddar, Harpur, on the
report of Muhammad Afzal,
complainant/respondent, who charged the
accused/petitioner along with co-accused
Basharat son of Ghulam Farid and Fiaz son
of Abdul Maroof for the gatil-i-amd of his
brother Muhammad Zakir at 0715 hours

on 03.07.2011 in his report lodged in DHQ
Hospital Haripur, on the same day at 2155
hours.

2. The accused/petitioner along
with co-accused remained at large and
were proceeded against under Sections
204 and 87 Cr.PC and challan was
submitted against all the three accused
charged in the FIR under Section 512
Cr.PC, and they were declared proclaimed
offenders and perpetual warrants of arrest
were issued against them by the learned
Judicial Magistrate, Haripur, vide order
dated 10.11.2011, the accused/petitioner
was arrested on 20.02.2013 and ever
since he is behind the bars as his plea for
bail was rejected on merit even by this
Court vide order dated 22.08.2014,
whereby, the trial Court was “directed to
expedite the disposal of trial and _ if
possible to conclude the same at the
earliest”. Supplementary challan against
the accused/petitioner was, however

submitted on 26.02.2013, leading to
commencement of trial after taking
cognizance in the case by the learned trial
Court on 04.06.2013, and framing of
formal charge. During trial, statements of
four official PWs, namely, Dr. Tahir Aziz
Chughtai (PW.1), Jamil FC (PW.2), Tariq
Aziz ASI (PW.3) and Riaz Khan ASI (PW.4)
have been recorded out of a total of 32
witnesses mentioned in the challan form
including private PWs like the complainant
and eye witnesses. Although some of the
private witnesses have been abandoned by
the prosecution, yet statements of
material witnesses, including complainant
and eye witnesses, are yet to be recorded.
3. Arguments of learned counsel
for the accused/petitioner and learned
State counsel assisted by learned counsel
for complainant/respondent heard, and
record perused.

4. Since application for post arrest
bail of the accused/petitioner has already

been dismissed by this Court on merit, this
discussion would be confined to
application for bail on statutory ground of
delay in conclusion of trial. Admittedly, the
accused/petitioner, after remaining
absconder for quite some time, and
declared proclaimed offender on
10.11.2011, was arrested on 20.02.2013;
and is behind the bars, ever since.
Supplementary challan against him was
submitted on 26.02.2013, whereupon
cognizance was taken by the learned trial
Court and a formal charge was framed
against the accused/petitioner, for the first
time, on 11.07.2013, meaning thereby the
accused/petitioner is facing the rigours of
trial, latest, since 11.07.2013, during
which only four official witnesses could be
examined by the learned trial Court,
leaving the other material witnesses
including the complainant and = eye
witnesses yet to be examined, who never
appeared for recording their statements

on a single date till application for post
arrest bail was moved on statutory ground
of delay in conclusion of trial, but even
then statement of complainant and other
private PWs could not be recorded due to
non-availability of Mr.Maqbool Hussain,
Advocate, representing the co-accused and
not because of absence of counsel for the
accused/petitioner or due to his request
for adjournment. It may also be mentioned
here that even on 21.01.2017, the eye
witness namely Fazil was not shown
present along with complainant. Anyhow,
the other successive order sheets since
11.07.2013 are replete with instances of
adjournments due to absence of PWs or
reasons not attributable to the
accused/petitioner, who was all along in
custody; barring few exceptional
adjournments on the request of defence
but even on those dates the material
prosecution witnesses were not present for
recording their statements on a single

date. Needless to say that other reasons
for adjournment like note reader and non
production of the accused/petitioner from
jail and abscondance of the co-accused
cannot serve as a ground for refusal of bail
to the accused/petitioner on statutory
ground of delay in conclusion of trial. In
short, delay in conclusion of trial cannot be
attributed to the accused/petitioner, rather
the prosecution is to mainly share blame
for such delay. In such a situation, the
accused/petitioner has been able to make
out a case for post arrest bail on the
statutory ground of delay in conclusion of
trial, notwithstanding his absconsion for
quite some time, as apart’ from
considerable delay in conclusion of trial for
the past more than three years, there
appears no likelihood of conclusion of trial
in the near future keeping in view number
of prosecution witnesses and failure on the
part of the prosecution to ensure their
attendance during the aforesaid period.

{2015 SCMR 1696, 2000 MLD 1061
(Peshawar), and 2012 YLR 477
(Sindh)}.

5. Therefore, the application is
accepted, and the accused/petitioner, is
admitted to bail subject to his furnishing
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100000/- with
two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial

Magistrate, Haripur.
