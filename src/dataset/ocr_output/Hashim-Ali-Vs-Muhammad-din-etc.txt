JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- At a trial

held by learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Peshawar,

appellant Hasham Ali, having found guilty of committing

the murder of Shahid and Mehar Din deceased and attempt

to commit murders, was convicted and sentenced as under

vide judgment dated 15.09.2012:-

Under Section 302 (b) PPC:- To undergo

imprisonment for life on two counts and

to pay Rs.4,00,000/-, as compensation to

LRs of deceased in terms of S.544-A

Under section 324 PPC: To undergo 02

or in default thereof to undergo 01 month

S.I. further.

The sentences have been directed to run

concurrently and benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C. has been extended to the

appellant.

2. Through the instant appeal, appellant-convict

has questioned his conviction and sentence while through

connected Cr.R. No.23-P/20-12, titled, “Sajjad Vs Hashim

Ali” petitioner seeks enhancement of sentence of the

convict from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death.

Since both, the appeal as well as revision petition, are the

outcome of one and the same judgment of the learned Trial

Court, therefore, we propose to dispose of the same

through this common judgment.

3. The prosecution case as unfolded in First

Information Report Exh.PA is that, on 28.12.2009 at 17.35

hours, complainant Muhammad Din (PW.1), in company

dead body of his deceased son Shahid, reported in Police

Station Mechani Gate, Peshawar, that on the fateful day he

alongwith his deceased son, brother Mehar Din as well as

Asif and Irfan Ullah, was present on a thoroughfare of

village Hassan Ghari, when at 17.05 hours, Hasham Ali

(appellant-convict herein) alongwith absconding co-

accused Sardar Ali, Asim Ali and Amin, came there in a

white colour motor car, deboarded from the same and

opened fire at them with the intention to do them away,

resultantly, his deceased son got hit and died on the spot,

while his brother Mehar Din, sustained injuries, however,

he and his other companions luckily remained unscathed.

A dispute over a house has been alleged as motive behind

the occurrence. Report of the complainant was recorded in

the shape of FIR Exh.PA by Muhammad Ejaz Khan ASI

(PW.3). He prepared injury sheet and inquest reports of the

deceased Exh.PW.3/1 and Exh.PW.3/2, respectively, and

shifted his dead body to the mortuary for post mortem

examination under the escort of constable Irfan Ullah.

Injured Mehar Din was shifted to LRH, Peshawar, where

Khan Abbas Khan SI (PW.2), prepared his injury sheet

Exh.PW.2/1 and referred him for medical treatment, who

later on, succumbed to injuries, therefore, he also prepared

his inquest report Exh.PW.2/2 and shifted his dead body to

the mortuary for post mortem examination.

Between death and Postmortem 09-18 hours.

6. Hassan Khan SHO (PW.6) proceeded to the

spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation of

eyewitnesses. During spot inspection he secured blood

with the help of cotton from the place of the deceased, a

spent bullet Exh.P.6, 2 empties of 7.62 bore P.10,

3 empties of 30 bore Exh.P.11, vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.6/1, in presence of witnesses and recorded their

statements under section 161 Cr.P.C. On 29.12.2009, he

took into possession the last worn bloodstained garments

of the two deceased, brought by constable Irfan Ullah vide

recovery memos Exh.PW.4/1 and Exh.PW.4/2, sent the

empties and bullet to the FSL, vide application

Exh.PW.6/3. He also sent the bloodstained articles to the

FSL vide application Exh.PW.6/5, and placed on file the

FSL reports Exh.PW.6/6 and Exh.PW.6/7. Accused-

appellant Hasham Ali was arrested by local police of

District Nowshera in case under section 13 A.O. vide FIR

No.4 dated 03.01.2010 PS Azakhel, so he was transferred

to Peshawar vide order Exh.PW.6/8. He arrested the

accused/appellant in the instant case and obtained his

judicial remand vide application Exh.PW.6/12. He

interrogated him and recorded his statement under section

161 Cr.P.C. Since, pistol was recovered from the

accused/appellant in the above mentioned case FIR,

therefore, he applied for transposition of the said pistol to

the instant case being case property, his request was

acceded to by the Sessions Judge, Peshawar. He took the

said 30 bore pistol alongwith 10 rounds Exh.P.12 from

Police Station Azakhel Nowshera vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.4/3, placed on file recovery memo of the pistol

prepared in case registered under section 13 A.O. against

10

the appellant alongwith copy of the FIR Exh.PW.6/19 and

Exh.PW.6/20. He sent the pistol Exh.P.12 to the FSL vide

application Exh.PW.6/21 for analysis with the empties

already sent to the FSL, report whereof is Exh.PZ. Since,

co-accused were absconding, therefore, he initiated

proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against

them. On completion of investigation he submitted

complete challan against the appellant and challan in terms

of S.512 Cr.P.C. against the absconding co-accused.

7. On receipt of challan by the learned Trial

Court, accused/appellant was charge sheeted, to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case,

prosecution examined as many as ten witnesses, whereas,

statements of Roshan Khan S.J. and Said Rehman were

recorded as CWs. After closure of the prosecution

evidence statement of the appellant was recorded under

section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he denied the prosecution

allegations and professed his innocence. He, however,

11

declined to be examined on oath or to produce evidence in

defence. On conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court, after

hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the

appellant as mentioned above.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant-convict

argued that appellant is innocent and has been implicated

falsely in the case on mere suspicions; that it is unseen

occurrence while complainant Muhammad Din (PW.1),

being real brother of deceased Mehar Din and father of the

deceased Shahid, is a procured witness, who miserably

failed to establish his presence on the spot at the time of

incident through some strong physical circumstances of the

incident; that medical evidence and site plan negate the

ocular version; that appellant has already been acquitted in

the case registered against him under section 13 A.O. in

Police Station Aza Khel, therefore, positive FSL report qua

the pistol and empties would not advance the case of the

prosecution; that PW Asif has been abandoned for no good

12

reason by the prosecution, therefore, adverse inference

within the meaning of Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-

Shahahdat Order, 1984 would be drawn against the

prosecution that had he been produced in the witness box,

he would not have supported the prosecution case; that

motive alleged has not been proved; that the testimony of

solitary witness i.e. complainant is suffering from material

contradictions and discrepancies creating serious doubts in

the prosecution case; that the learned Trial Court has not

appreciated the evidence available on record in its true

perspective, hence, reached to an erroneous conclusion by

holding the appellant guilty of the offence; that the

impugned judgment being based on surmises and

conjectures, is liable to be set at naught.

9. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant contended that appellant

alongwith absconding co-accused are directly charged in a

promptly lodged report; that complainant Muhammad Din

13

has furnished truthful and straightforward ocular account

of the incident, supported by medical evidence, site plan

and recoveries from the spot coupled with positive FSL

reports qua empties and pistol as well as the bloodstained

articles; that defence failed to create any dent in his

testimony; that mere close relationship of the complainant

with the two deceased cannot be a ground for discarding

his confidence inspiring testimony; that PW Irfan Ullah

who was nephew of the complainant has been done to

death by brother of the appellant during the trial at the

instance of the appellant, in which incident the

complainant also sustained injuries while PW Asif refused

to appear in the witness box because of threats of the

accused party and this aspect of the case further indicates

that accused party are hardened and desperate criminals;

that defence cannot take benefit from acquittal of the

appellant in a case registered against him under Section 13

A.O. as he had been acquitted in that case on sole ground

14

of non-production of the case property, which was in fact

taken into possession in the instant case as a weapon of

offence and sent to the FSL, report whereof is positive

that’s why the same was not produced before the learned

Trial Court/Judicial Magistrate; that prosecution has

successfully proved the guilt of the appellant through

cogent and confidence inspiring evidence, therefore, the

learned Trial Court has rightly held him guilty of the

offence. They added that being a double murder case and

there being no mitigating circumstance to warrant lesser

punishment, therefore, the learned Trial Court ought to

have awarded the appellant normal penalty of death as

provided for the offence. They sought dismissal of the

appeal and requested for enhancement of sentence of the

appellant.

10. In this untoward incident two persons,

namely, Shahid and Mehar Din, have been done to death,

for which, appellant-convict alongwith absconding

15

co-accused Sardar Ali, Asim Ali and Amin, have been

directly charged by complainant Muhammad Din (PW.1),

who is father of the former deceased and uncle of the

latter. The crime venue is a thoroughfare of village Hassan

Ghari. The incident took place on 28.12.2009 at 17.05

hours, which has been reported with promptitude at 17.35

hours i.e. within 30 minutes of the incident, eliminating the

possibility of deliberation, consultation and fabrication on

the part of complainant because it does not appeal to a

prudent mind that the complainant, who was confronted

with the dead body of his deceased son and his injured

nephew, would have been in a position to fabricate a

concocted story within 30 minutes, which time he would

have definitely consumed in arranging vehicle and in

shifting the dead body of the deceased as well as injured.

Being a broad daylight incident and parties well known to

each other, having a dispute over shop, question of

mistaken identity does not arise.

16

11. In support of his version, complainant

Muhammad Din appeared as a solitary witness. As regard

PWs Irfan Ullah and Asif, named in the present FIR as

eyewitnesses, PW Irfan Ullah, who was nephew of the

complainant, has been done to death during pendency of

trial of the appellant, for which brother of the appellant has

been charged vide FIR No.473 dated 18.09.2010 under

sections 302/324/34 PPC Police Station Miechni Gate,

Peshawar. Similarly, in the aforesaid incident complainant

also sustained injuries. PW Irfan Ullah being

dead/murdered was abandoned while PW Asif due to fear

of the accused/appellant refused to appear in the witness

box.

12. Complainant Muhammad Din, while

appearing as PW.1, reiterated the same episode of the

incident as mentioned in his initial report coupled with

motive. He charged the appellant and absconding

co-accused for committing the murder of the two deceased

17

and attempting at their lives. He added in his statement that

PW Irfan Ullah has been murdered by brother of the

appellant at the instance of appellant during pendency of

the trial in which incident he also sustained injuries. In

support of his statement he produced copy of the FIR. He

was subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by

the defence, but nothing beneficial could be brought from

his mouth. He remained stuck to his stance and remained

consistent on each and every material aspect of the

incident. Defence also failed to create any doubt about his

presence on the spot despite lengthy cross-examination of

complainant. Shifting of dead body from the spot to Police

Station within 30 minutes is an important aspect of the

case which speaks about presence of the complainant with

the deceased on the spot at the time of incident. The

incident has been reported directly in the FIR, therefore,

question of manipulation on the part of police to procure

his attendance, does not arise.

18

13. Medical evidence in the shape of statements

of doctors Iftikhar Ahmad and Naveed Alam, who

conducted autopsy on the dead bodies of the deceased,

coupled with autopsy reports of the deceased, according to

which, both the deceased met their unnatural death due to

firearms, further supports the ocular account. Similarly,

recovery of blood from the places of the two deceased

during spot inspection by the IO. and last worn

bloodstained garments of the two deceased coupled with

positive Serologist report also corroborate the ocular

account and confirm the crime spot to be the same as

alleged by the complainant.

14. Three crime empties of 30 bore pistol

recovered from the spot, have sent to the FSL alongwith

30 bore pistol recovered from the appellant in case FIR

No.04 dated 03.01.2010 under Section 13 A.O. Police

Station Aza Khel Nowshera Exh.PW.6/19, positive report

whereof Exh.PZ, further corroborates the ocular account.

19

15. The argument of learned counsel for the

appellant that in the aforesaid case, appellant had been

acquitted by learned Judicial Magistrate-III, Nowshera

vide order dated 10.12.2010, therefore, this piece of

evidence would not advance the prosecution case is not

tenable because according to the record produced/

exhibited by the Hassan Khan SHO/I.O. in the instant case

during his statement, the said pistol had been taken into

possession by him in the instant case vide recovery memo

Exh.PW.4/3 by proper order of the Sessions Judge. He also

made recovery memo of the case FIR No.4 dated

03.01.2010 as part and parcel of the instant case and

thereafter sent it to the FSL for chemical analysis, report

whereof is Exh.PZ. The acquittal order of the appellant

recorded by learned Judicial Magistrate, Nowshera reveals

that because of non-availability of the Firearm Expert

report and non-exhibition of the pistol, she recorded

acquittal of the appellant, without adverting to the record

20

vide which the pistol in question had been taken into

possession and shifted from District Nowshera to

Peshawar in the present case. Roshan Khan SI who

arrested the appellant alongwith 30 bore pistol and 10 live

rounds and registered a case under section 13 A.O. against

him in Police Station Azakhel Nowshera, has been

examined as CW.1. He deposed that on receipt of

information about presence of the appellant near Aman

Garh Head Bridge on 03.01.2010, rushed there and

arrested him alongwith 30 bore pistol and 10 live rounds

vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/20. Said Rehman

Constable No.1044, in whose presence the recovery of

pistol had been effected by Roshan Khan S.J CW.1, has

been examined as CW.2. In his statement he fully

corroborated the version of Roshan Khan S.I. Both these

witnesses have been subjected to cross-examination by the

defence, but nothing beneficial could be extracted from

them. They remained consistent with each other on all

21

material aspects of the arrest of the appellant and recovery

of 30 bore pistol from his direct possession, which is

weapon of offence in the instant murder case. The

irregularity committed by the learned Trial Court is that

both the cases should have been tried together, but such

exercise has not been adopted by the learned Trial Court,

which created a disturbing situation. Similarly, the learned

Judicial Magistrate, without taking into consideration the

pistol in question to be the weapon of offence of the

murder case, haphazardly recorded acquittal of the

appellant without any solid ground, because when the

pistol in question was sent to the FSL in the instant case,

how its production was possible before the learned Trial

Court. As per the dictum laid down by the Hon’ble

Federal Court in case titled, “Sadiq and others Vs the

Crown” (PLD 1951 FC 114), the offences being form part

of the same transaction can legally be tried at one trial. To

22

avoid conflicting findings, trial of both the offences in one

and the same court was essential requirement.

16. So far as the argument of learned counsel for

the appellant that the learned Trial Court has wrongly

recorded conviction of the appellant on the basis of

solitary witness, who too, was closely related to the

deceased, suffice it to say that in criminal cases what is

more essential for the Court, is the determination of

veracity and credibility of a witness and not the numbers

and relationship, because it is quality and not the quantity

of the evidence which matters. In this case complainant

Muhammad Din appeared as a solitary witness for the

reason that PW Irfan Ullah had been done to death during

trial for which brother of the appellant has been charged.

In the said incident complainant also sustained injuries but

survived. PW Asif has been abandoned by the prosecution

and the justification of the learned counsel for the

complainant that he was threatened by the appellant party

23

and that’s why he refused to appear in the witness box,

does appeal to reason keeping in view the previous

criminal history of the accused party as manifest from the

FIRs collected by the I.O during investigation and placed

on file. Even otherwise, by virtue of Article 17 of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, in financial matters, two

male or one male and two female witnesses, have been

made the requirement of law to prove the financial

obligations. Whereas in all other matters including

criminal, there is no such obligation, which clearly suggest

that a single witness is sufficient to prove a fact. When the

law permits a fact to be proved through the statement of a

single witness, there is no reason or logic to call for more

witnesses than one. Guidance in this regard may be

derived from Zar Badadar’s case (1978 SCMR 136). In

case titled, “Muhammad Ahmad and another Vs the

State and others”(1997 SCMR 89), it has been held by

24

the Hon’ble Supreme Court that “prosecution is not

required to examine every eyewitness of a crime”.

17. In case titled, Muhammad Mansha Vs the
State” (2001 SCMR 199), the Ho’ble Supreme Court while
dilating upon the spirit of Article 17 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, held the following:-

“A bare perusal would reveal that the

language as employed in the said Article 17

(1) (b) is free from any ambiguity and no

scholarly interpretation is required. The

provisions as reproduced hereinabove of the

said Article would make it abundant clear

that particular number of witnesses shall not

be required for the proof of any fact

meaning thereby that a fact can be proved

only by a single witness”.

In the Judgment Supra it has been held by the Apex Court

that conviction can be recorded on the testimony of a single

witness. Guidance in this regard can also be derived from

cases titled, “Dildar Hussain Vs Muhammad Afzaal alias

Chala and 3 others” (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 663),

25

and case titled, “Farooq Khan Vs the State” (2008
SCMR 917). The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Faroog Khan Vs the State” (2008 SCMR 917) observed
as under:-

“The credence of statement of solitary

witness has already been examined by

this Court in a number of cases. In this

context reference can be made to Mali v.

The State 1969 SCMR 76; Muhammad

Ashraf v. The State 1971 SCMR 530,

Muhammad Siddique alias Ashraf alias

Achhi and 3 others v. The State 1971

SCMR 659 and Muhammad Mansha v.

The State 2001 SCMR 199. Moreover,

conviction in any murder case can be

based on the testimony of a single

witness, if the Court is satisfied that the

witness is reliable. In other words, the

"emphasis" is on quality of evidence, and

26

not on its quantity. In this behalf reliance

can be placed on the case of Allah

Bakhsh v. Shammi PLD 1980S C 225”.

Similarly, mere relationship of the prosecution witness with

the deceased is no ground to discredit his evidence, if his

testimony is proved to be straightforward and confidence

inspiring. Guidance in this regard can be derived from case

titled, “Umarzad Vs the State” (1990 SCMR 571),

“Sahib Khan Vs the State” (2008 SCMR 1052), “Bashir

Khan Vs the State” (1995 SCMR 900) and “Nazir

Ahmad Vs Muhammad Sidique “ (1995 SCMR 1740).

18. For what has been discussed above, we are

firm in our view that prosecution has successfully proved

the guilt of the appellant through cogent and confidence

inspiring ocular evidence corroborated by _ strong

circumstantial pieces of evidence as well as medical

evidence, therefore, the learned Trial Court was justified

27

while recording the conviction of the appellant, to which no

exception can be taken.

19. Now coming to the question of sentence. Two

persons have been done to death in the present incident.

General role of firing has been attributed to four accused

including the appellant. The question as to whose fire shots

proved fatal is not discernible from the evidence available

on record, therefore, considering the same as a mitigating

circumstance, maximum penalty of death in the

circumstances, would not be a step justified in law,

therefore, the sentence awarded by the learned Trial Court

in the circumstances seems to be just, which would meet

the ends of justice. Admittedly, the appellant has been

acquitted in case under Section 13 of the Arms Ordinance

registered in Police Station Azakhel Nowshera, against

which no appeal has been filed by the State therefore, in the

circumstances, conviction of the appellant under section 13

of the Arms Ordinance, would not be justified. However,

28

positive FSL report qua the empties and the crime pistol can

be taken as a corroborative piece of evidence in support of

the prosecution case.

20. Resultantly, the appeal as well as the revision

petition for enhancement of sentence being without any

substance stands dismissed. Conviction and sentence of the

appellant recorded and awarded by the learned Trial Court

vide impugned judgment, are hereby upheld.

21. Before parting with the judgment, we deem it

appropriate to direct all the learned Judicial Magistrates of

the Province, that they shall not try a case of any recovery,

if such recovery is case property in any other criminal case,

triable by the Court of Sessions and shall henceforth submit

the same to the Court of the respective Sessions Judge, for

appropriate orders. Similarly, the learned Trial Courts

confronted with the trials, if at any stage come to know

about registration of a separate case qua recovery in a case

pending adjudication before them, shall forthwith, stop the

29

proceedings unless the case of the recovery registered

separately, is not procured and thereafter shall try both the

cases, simultaneously, so as to avoid conflicting findings.

The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court

is directed to circulate copy of this judgment amongst all

the learned Judges of the subordinate judiciary for

convenience and future guidance, with intimation to this

court.

Announced.
