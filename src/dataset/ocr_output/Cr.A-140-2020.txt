with fine of Rs.2,00,000/- each. In default thereof they
were ordered to further undergo simple imprisonment for
six months each and benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C

about 1100 hours, complainant of the case namely, Atif
Qayyum Inspector Excise & Taxation and Narcotics

police party were present at GT road Bara Mour Salhad
in connection of Nakabandi on spy information. In the
meanwhile, one XLI motorcar bearing registration
No.LED-08-9980 came from Havelian side, which was
stopped by the complainant with the help of his
companions. Two persons were sitting in the said
vehicle. The driver disclosed his name as Shoaib while
person sitting on front seat disclosed his name as Zafar
Ali. Since the complainant has received spy information
in respect of the said vehicle that narcotics is being
smuggled in it, therefore, the vehicle was checked.
During the search of secret cavities made in the floor
and behind the rear seat 80 slabs of chars wrapped in
yellow plastic was recovered. 20/20 slabs of chars
sealed into separate shoppers. Thereafter, the said four
shoppers were weighed at the spot. Shopper No.1 was
containing 22848 grams chars, shopper No.2 containing
22771 grams chars, shopper No.3 containing 21839
chars whereas shopper No.4 was containing 23028
grams chars, thus total weight of recovered contraband
was 90486 grams of 80 slabs. From 20 slabs of chars
contained in shopper No.1, 5/5 grams were separated
for the purpose of FSL and sealed into parcel No.1 to 20,

grams were separated from corner of each slabs for FSL
and sealed into parcel No.21 to 40, from 20 slabs of

station for registration of FIR through constable Raja
Aftab while case property and accused were sent to
police station through constable Fayyaz under the
supervision of Naseem Khan SI through official vehicle

Mustajab and on the basis of which case FIR No.1296
dated 15.11.2018 under section 9-C CNSA_ was

was submitted against the accused as well as

absconding co-accused namely Aamir Shahzad under
section 512 Cr.P.C. After compliance of section 265 (C)
Cr.P.C charge was framed against the accused on
13.06.2019 to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. In order to prove its case against the accused
prosecution has produced as many as seven witnesses.
After conclusion of trial, the learned trial court found the
appellants guilty of the charge and while recording their
conviction and sentenced them as mentioned above

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5, The scanning of the record reveals that the
prosecution case hinges on the testimony of
complainant, alleged eye witnesses, Investigation Officer
and transmission of the case property from the spot to
police station and from police station to laboratory for
chemical examination and its positive FSL report.

6. Perusal of the case record would show that as per
Murasila Ex:PA reflects that on 15.11.2018, complainant
of the case namely, Atif Qayyum Inspector Hazara
Division Excise Taxation & Narcotics Control Department
(PW-1) alongwith other police party were on routine
patrolling, received spy information about the coming of
vehicle bearing registration No.LEB-08-9980 from
Havelian side having narcotics in it. On this information
he alongwith his companions proceeded to Salhad and
made barricade. At about 1100 hours they stopped the
vehicle and on search of the said vehicle chars from
secret cavity was recovered in shape of four slabs total

weighing 90486 grams was made. The complainant
nN

separated of 5/5 grams chars from each slab and sealed
into separate parcels for the purpose of chemical
analysis, whereas the remaining chars was sealed into
separate parcels. The accused namely Zafar Ali and
Shoaib were arrested on the spot.

Te The prosecution in order to establish its case
against the appellants produced as many as seven
witnesses. PW-1 is the statement of Atif Qayyum, who is
the complainant of the case reiterated the same facts as
narrated in the Murasila Ex:PA. PW-2 is the statement of
Naseem Khan, SI Hazara Division Excise Taxation &
Narcotics Control Department, who is marginal witness
of recovery memo Ex:PW1/1. PW-3 is the statement of
Nazir Khan Sl, who is investigating officer of the case
stated that he through application Ex:PW3/2 produced
both the accused before Magistrate for obtaining their
custody and vide application Ex:PW3/3 produced the
accused for recording their confessional statements,
through application Ex:PW3/4 he applied for warrant
under section 204 Cr.P.C and through application
Ex:PW3/7 applied for proceedings under section 87
Cr.P.C, he also placed on file FSL report, departure and
return entries with record Ex:PW3/11 to Ex:PW3/17, he
prepared card of arrest of both the accused Ex:PW3/18
and Ex:PW3/19 and recorded statement of PWs under
section 161 Cr.P.C. PW-4 is the statement of Shahid Ali
No.1231, who stated that on 16.11.2018 vide road

certificate No.308 Ex:PW4/1 Maded Muharrir of the
police station handed over parcels No.1 to 80 of the
instant case for onward transmission to FSL and
deposited the said parcels in the FSL on the same day.
PW-5 Muhammad Rafagat MHC, who on receipt of
murasila. chalked out FIR Ex:PA. PW-6 Sardar
M.Rafique SHO, who submitted complete challan
against the accused Ex:PW6/1 and PW-7 constable
Mushtag No.121 who stated that he was entrusted with
warrant under section 204 Ex:PW3/5 and proclamation
under section 87 already Ex:PW3/8.

8. Scanning of prosecution evidence shows that
complainant stated in his examination in chief that he
sent the case property alongwith accused under the
escort of constable Fayyaz and under the supervision of
Naseem Khan ASI in the official vehicle driven by
Mustajab. Naseem Khan ASI when appeared as PW-2
stated in examination in chief that he is marginal witness
of recovery memo Ex:PW1/1 vide which complainant
during the course of gasht recovered chars from secret
cavities of vehicle bearing No.LB-08-9980. This witness
simply stated in his cross examination that they took the
documents, case property and accused in the official
pick-up having No.9862 and does not depose about the
handing over the case property to Maded Moharrir.
More-so, Shahid Ali No.1231 stated in his statement that
on 16.11.2018 vide road _ certificate No.308/21
(Ex:PW4/1) Madded Muharrir of the police station

handed over parcels No.1 to 80 of the instant case for
onward transmission to FSL Peshawar but the
prosecution has not produced and examined, neither
constable Fayaz to whom parcels No.1 to 80, containing
samples for FSL, were entrusted for submission to
Moharrir for safe custody from spot to police station nor
Moharrir was produced as witness. The non-production
of above witnesses leads us to only one corollary that
chain of safe custody has not been proved by the
prosecution. The prosecution also by not producing as
witness the Madded Moharrir, who handed over the
samples to constable Shahid Ali No.1231 put a serious
dent in the prosecution case about safe custody of
contraband. The safe custody and its transmission to
police station and latter its transmission to FSL
laboratory is of utmost and paramount importance and in
case of failure the whole super structure built on the
recovery of contraband will fall to the ground. Reliance in
this regard is placed on Criminal Appeal No. 184 to 2020
decided on 06" January 2021 reported as 2021 SCMR
451, which held as under;
“The chain of custody or safe custody and safe
transmission of narcotic drug begins with
seizure of the narcotic drug by the law
enforcement officer, followed by reparation of
representative samples of the seized narcotic
drug, storage of the representative samples and
the narcotics drug with the law enforcement
agency and then dispatch of the representative
samples of the narcotics drugs to the office
chemical examination for examination and
testing. This chain of custody must be safe and
secure. This is because, the report of the
chemical examination enjoys critical importance

under CNSA and the chain of custody ensure
that correct representative samples reach the
office of the chemical examiner. Any break or
gap in the chain of custody i.e. in the safe
custody or safe transmission of the narcotic
drug or its representative samples makes the
report of the chemical examiner unsafe and
unreliable for justifying conviction of the
accused. The prosecution, therefore, has to
establish that the chain of custody has been
unbroken and is safe, secure and indisputable
on the report of chemical examiner”.
9. Further reliance is placed on the case of Imam
Baksh’s case (2018 SCMR 2039), Zubair Khan V. The
State (2021 SCMR 492), Mst Razia Sulana V. The
State (2019 SCMR 1300).
10. The above discussion has led this Court to believe
that the learned trial court has erred in appreciating the
case evidence in its true perspective. It has been held,
time and again by the superior courts, that a reasonable
doubt found in the prosecution case is sufficient to acquit
an accused. For extending the benefit of doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. Single circumstance, creating
reasonable doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of
accused, makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a
matter of grace or concession, but as a matter of right.
Reliance could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230, 2011
SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, PLD 1984 SC 433, 2012
MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 PCr.LJ 376, PLD
1994 Peshawar 114, PLD 2012 Peshawar 01, 1999
PCr.LJ 1087, 1997 SCMR 449, 2011 SCMR 820 and
2006 PCr.LJ SC 1002(sic). The conclusions drawn by

the learned trial Court are not borne out of the case
2006 PCr.LJ SC 1002(sic). The conclusions drawn by
the learned trial Court are not borne out of the case
evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment is not
sustainable.

11. For what has been discussed above, we hold that
prosecution have not been able to prove their case
beyond reasonable doubts, therefore, the impugned
judgment warrants interference. As such this appeal is
allowed and the appellants are acquitted from the
charges leveled against them by extending them benefit
of doubt. They be released forthwith from Jail, if not
required in any other case.

These are the detailed reasons of the order of

even date.
