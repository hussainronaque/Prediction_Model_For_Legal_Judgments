JUDGMENT
ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Petitioner Naseem Ullah,
after facing trial in case FIR No.213 dated 10.07.2018,
registered under Sections 302, 109 and 34 PPC and
Section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, at Police Station West
Cantt. Peshawar, was convicted under section 302(b)
PPC and sentenced to death and to pay rupees five lac,
as compensation in terms of Section 544-A Cr.P.C. to
legal heirs of Faisal Shams deceased and in default
thereof to further undergo six months simple
imprisonment and under section 15 KP Arms Act
2013, to undergo three years rigorous imprisonment
and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default thereof
to further undergo three months simple imprisonment,

by learned Additional Sessions Judge/Model Criminal
Trial Court, Peshawar, vide judgment(s) dated
20.03.2021. The petitioner challenged his conviction
and sentences before this court through Cr.A. No.
278-P of 2021 and Cr.A. No.283-P of 2021, whereas
for confirmation of death sentence of the petitioner, the
leamed trial Court sent Murder Reference No.7 of
2021,. This court after hearing the aforesaid three
matters, vide judgment(s) dated 08.03.2022,
maintained conviction of the petitioner under section
302(b) PPC, however, altered/reduced sentence of
death to imprisonment for life and answered Murder
Reference in the Negative. While dismissing Cr.A.
No.283-P_of 2021, this court maintained conviction
and sentence of the petitioner under section 15 KP
Arms Act, 2013. The substantives sentences of
imprisonment under the aforesaid two offences were
not directed to run concurrently and similarly, benefit
of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was not extended to the
appellant by the Appellate Court.

2. Feeling aggrieved, the petitioner through
this constitutional petition under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is
seeking issuance of the following writ:-

“ It is, therefore, humbly prayed that on

acceptance of this petition, this august

Court may graciously be pleased to direct
extension of benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.P.C. as well as concurrent running of
life imprisonment under section 302 PPC
with the sentence awarded under section
15 KP Arms Act, 2013 to the petitioner.”

3. Initially, comments of the respondents were
called, which were accordingly filed by them, wherein
they have admitted the facts advanced by the petitioner
in the writ petition.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties
heard and record perused with their able assistance.

5. Judgment dated 20.03.2021, depicts that
learned trial court while convicting and sentencing the
petitioner under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, has
extended him benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. and this
court while dismissing Cr.A. No.283-P of 2021 has
maintained the judgment dated 20.03.2021 of the
learned trial Court, meaning thereby that benefit of
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. already extended to the
petitioner has been maintained by this court. However,
neither the learned trial court neither this court while
dismissing appeal of the petitioner has directed his
sentence to run concurrently with the sentence of
imprisonment for life.

6. In the murder charge, this court while
altering death sentence of the petitioner to

imprisonment for life under section 302(b) PPC has
inadvertently ignored the mandatory provisions of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. as well as directing the
substantive sentences of imprisonment under the two
offences to run concurrently. To resolve the
controversy it would be advantageous to refer to
section Section 382-B Cr.P.C., which read as under:-

“S.382-B. Period of detention to be
considered while awarding sentence of
imprisonment:- Where a Court decides to
pass a sentence of imprisonment on an
accused for an offence, it shall take into
consideration the period, if any, during
which such accused was detained in

custody for such offence.”

“Section 382-B Cr.P.C. was added by the Law
Reforms Ordinance, 1972. The word “Shall”
was substituted for the word “may “by the
Code of Criminal Procedure (Second
Amendment) Ordinance, No.LXTHI of 1979.

7. The provisions of Section 382-B Cr.P.C.
have undergone scrutiny by the worthy superior Courts
and have been interpreted in a plethora of cases. For
the sake of convince and ready reference some of the
judgments are refereed herein below. In case titled,
“Qadir Vs State (PLD 1991 SC_1065), the Hon’ble
Supreme court while dilating upon the provisions of
section 382-B CrP.C. has held that it being a

beneficial provision is to be interpreted liberally.
Relevant observations in this regard are reproduced
below:-

“Tt may be noted that the mandatory
provision has been introduced because of
the realization that an accused person is
entitled to be put to trial or released on
bail. If he is riot to be released on bail, he
must be put to trial. If for any reason the
State is unable to put him up for trial it is
only fair that during the period he is
detained to await his trial that period is
taken into consideration in computing the
sentence of imprisonment given to him.
Another point to be noted is that the
provision occurs in a criminal statute
which requires strict construction as far as
it imposes restrictions and punishments.
Beneficial provisions need to be
constructed liberally. These are axiomatic

principles.”
In case titled, “Ramzan Vs the Ate (PLD 1992 SC 11),
the august apex court has adhered to the exposition of
law made in Qadir’s case (supra). Similarly, in case
titled, Liagat Hussain Vs State (PLD 1995 SC 485), it
has been held by the Supreme Court that the trial court
or the Federal Shariat Court had not pointed out any
circumstance which would justify the denial of the
extension of the benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. to the
appellant in the said case. Thus, while maintaining the
conviction and sentences of the appellant awarded by
the trial court and affirmed by the Federal Shariat

Court, the apex court directed that the benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. would be extended to the

appellant. In case titled “Muhammad Rafiq’s case
1995__SCMR__1525), the Supreme Court while
examining the provisions of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has
held as under:-

“Section 67 of the English Act and section
428 of the Indian Act provide expressly
that the sentence of imprisonment imposed
by the court shall stand reduced by the
pre-sentence period spent in jail (the
English Act) or which is the same thing,
that the pre-sentence period shall be set off
against the term of imprisonment imposed
on him (the Indian Act). The English and
the Indian Acts do not, therefore, leave as
regards the pre-sentence period spent in
jail, anything to be clone by the sentencing
court. Instead, they direct chat the period
so spent in jail shall automatically count
towards the sentence of imprisonment
imposed by the court and the sentence of
imprisonment shall stand _ reduced
accordingly.

We wish that section 382-B of the
Code were also couched in language as
clear and unambiguous as the sections in
the Indian and the English enactments are.
If it were, then, it would be right to say, as
has become customary to do, that the
convict should get the benefit of that
section. But unfortunately it does not.”

In case titled, “Mukhtar ud Din Vs State (1997
SCMR__55), the Hon'ble supreme Court has
exhaustively dealt with the provisions of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. has held that:-

“(i) That strictly speaking section 382-B
Cr.P.C. is attracted to, when a court
decides to pass a sentence either in the
trial or appellate or revisional proceedings
against an accused for the offence charged
with. In other words, if the sentence has
already been passed by a trial court and
the matter is brought before an Appellate
Court, strictly speaking, section 382-B
Cr.P.C. is not applicable. However, there
is no legal bar and that an appellate Court
is competent to grant the benefit of the
above provision to a convict. Furthermore,
a convict will be entitled to agitate before
the Appellate Court the question, that the
trial court had failed to consider the above
provisions while imposing the sentence on
him or that he was wrongly denied the
benefit of the same, in such a case, the
Appellate Court would be bound to
examine the above question and to rectify
the error/mistake, if any, committed by the
trial Court.

(ii) That if an appellate court substitutes
death sentence to that of imprisonment for
life or rigorous imprisonment for a certain
period, it is obligatory on its part to take
into consideration above section 382-B
Cr.P.C. for example, if a High court in a
murder appeal/reference alters conviction
from section 302 PPC to that under section
304 Part-I, PPC and substitutes death
sentence to that of rigorous imprisonment
for seven or ten years, it is mandatory for
it to advert to the question of extending the
benefit of the above provisions to the

convict while imposing above sentence.
(iii) that though under section 382-B
Cr.P.C. the court has discretion not to
grant the benefit of the same to a convict
but this discretion is to be exercised
judiciously on sound judicial principles
inter alia as explained hereinabove in
para 9.

(iv) That since the provision of section
382-B Cr.P,C. is mandatory, in the
absence of express manifestation of the
application of the mind by the court that it
has addressed itself to the above provision
at the time of imposing sentence on the
convict concerned, no presumption can be
raised in favour of the court of having

adverted to the same.”

The aforesaid view has been reiterated by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in cases titled, “Ghulam Murtaza Vs

the State (PLD 1998 SC 152), “Javed Iqbal Vs the

State” (1998 _ SCMR_ 1539), “Ehsan Ellahi Vs
Muhammad _ Arif (2001 SCMR_ 416). In case title,

“Shah Hussain vs the State” (PD 2009 Supreme
Court 460), while placing reliance on the judgments
(supra), in its authoritative judgment has observed as

under:-

“(1) While passing sentence, the court, in
the absence of special circumstances
disentitling the accused to have his
sentence of imprisonment reduced by the
period spent in jail during the trial,
exercise its discretion in favour of the
accused by ordering that such period shall
be counted towards his sentence of

imprisonment or that the sentence of
imprisonment shall be treated as reduced
by that period.

(2) The discretion has to be ordered with
the intention to promote the policy and
objects of the law;

(3) Indeed, the court will use its good
sense in determining the circumstances in
which the discretion will not be exercised
in favour of the accused. But as the
discretion is a judicial discretion, the order
of the court must show that the pre-
sentence period has been taken into
consideration and if the court thinks that
the sentence should not be reduced by the
period spent in imprisonment during the
trial, the court must give reasons for so
thinking;

(4) The word “shall” is intended to make
the provision mandatory in the sense that it
imposes a duty to do what is prescribed
and same admits of no doubt whatever;

(5) The provision occurs in a criminal
statute which requires strict construction
as far as it imposes restrictions and
punishments. Beneficial provisions need to
be constructed liberally. In any event, the
fact that when the section 382-B Cr.P.C.
was first enacted the word used was “may”
and later it was substituted by the word
“shall” provides the clearest possible
evidence that the intention was that the
court must take the pre-sentence period of
detention in jail “into consideration”.
Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is, therefore, a
statutory limitation upon the court’s
discretion to determine the length of
imprisonment. It must “take into
consideration” the pre-sentence period

spent in jail;
10

(6) The benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.
is also available to a person who sentence
of death under section 302 PPC has been
subsequently altered to imprisonment for
life;

(7) As the accused is put in jail for the
very offence for which he is convicted and
sentenced to imprisonment, the pre-
sentence period spent by him in jail is not
in vain and must, therefore, be taken into

account.,”

8. In case titled, “Government_of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa through Secretary Home and Tribal
Affairs Department Peshawar _and_ others Vs

Mehmood Khan” (2017 SCMR 2044), the Apepllate

court while altering death sentence of convict into
imprisonment for life, inadvertently, did not extend
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C to the convict. The
convict filed constitutional petition before the this
court and the same was allowed, resultantly, he was
extended benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. Feeling
aggrieved the Government of KP through Secretary
Home and Tribal Affairs Department Peshawar filed

Civil Petition No.332-P_of 2017 before the Hon’ble

Supreme Court, where while refusing leave to appeal,
the august apex court held as under:-
| “In the present case, as has been rightly
pointed out, while partly accepting the

appeal against death sentence awarded

under section 302 PPC to the respondent,
11

it was reduced to life imprisonment,
however, the learned Division Bench of
the High Court conveniently ignored the
mandatory provision of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. which was an omission of
technical nature and not substantive one,
which would not attract any bar to amend
the original judgment but through the
impugned judgment the omission made
was rectified and the command of the law

was given effect in letter and spirit.

As_highlighted_and_ explained
above, now extension of benefit of pre-
conviction detention period be deducted
from__the ___sentence__ awarded __is
mandatory and for refusal to grant the
same, cogent, strong and convincing
reasons _are_to be recorded. In the
instant case, it was a simple commission
on the part of the learned Bench of the
High Court to look at the substance of
the mandatory provisions of section
382-B Cr.P.C., this it can be rectified at
any stage and even the Jailer in whose
custody the prisoner_is undergoing
sentence, is bound to award such benefi
even if the judgment is silent unless the
court__for cogent _and___confidence
inspiring reasons has expressly refused
12

to_grant such benefit. (Bold and

underlines supplied emphasis).

9. Taking the case of the petitioner at the touch
stone of the law settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in the judgments (supra), we have noticed that the
learned Appellate Court has not given any strong,
cogent and convicting reasons for not extending
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. to the petitioner while
altering his death sentence to life imprisonment. In this
view of the matter, it is a simple omission on the part
of the learned Appellate Court to look at the substance
of the mandatory provisions of section 382-B Cr.P.C,
hence, the same can be rectified.

10. Adverting to another prayer of the petitioner
that his sentence of imprisonment under section 302(b)
PPC may be directed to run concurrently with his
sentence of imprisonment under section 15 KP Arms
Act, 2013. Section 35 Cr.P.C. is very much applicable
to case of the petitioner as record shows that petitioner
has been tried for more offences than one in one and
the same trial. Section 35 Cr.P.C. subject to section 71
of the PPC, empowers not only the trial Court to award
several sentences to a person charged for multiple
offences in the same trial but in its discretion may
direct that such sentences shall run concurrently. Even

the Appellate Court while hearing the appeal against
13

the conviction may direct several sentences awarded in
the same trial, to run concurrently. Unfortunately, in
this case, neither the trial Court nor the appellant court
passed any order with regard to sentences of
imprisonment of the petitioner to run concurrently.
Judgments of both the courts are silent in this regard.
Section 397 Cr.P.C. enables and empowers the trial,
and or the Appellate/Revisional Court, as the case may
be, in a subsequent trial or in appeal or revision,
arising out of the subsequent trial to order for the
consolidation of sentences in subsequent trial with the
sentence awarded in earlier trial(s) as may be
maintained or modified in appeal/revision arising
therefrom. In case titled, “Rahib Ali Vs the State”
(2018 SCMR 418), it has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court that High Court and the Supreme Court
had jurisdiction under section 561-A read with section
35 and 397 Cr.P.C., as the case may be, to order
multiple sentences awarded in the same trial or in
separate or subsequent trial to run concurrently.

11. For what has been discussed above, deriving
guidance and placing reliance on the judgments (supra)
of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, we are of the
considered view that petitioner is entitled to benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. and his substantive sentences of

imprisonment to run concurrently.
14

12. Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed.
Consequently, benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. is
extended to the petitioner and his substantive sentences
of imprisonment under section 302(b) PPC and section
15 KP Arms Act, 2013, shall run concurrently. The
Superintendent of the concerned Jail is directed to do
the needful.
