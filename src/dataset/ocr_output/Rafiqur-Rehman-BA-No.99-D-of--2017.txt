3. Perusal of record reveals _ that
impugned order dated 30.6.2016 of learned Sessions
Judge, Tank was recorded in absence of accused-
petitioner. There is nothing on record to show that
accused was ever summoned or his sureties were put
on notice.

4. Learned Sessions Judge, Tank was at
fault to decide BCA in the absence of accused-
petitioner, which is nullity in the eye of law, hence
impugned order is set aside. Record of the case be
sent back to the Court of learned Sessions Judge,
Tank with the direction to hear the BCA in the
presence of accused-petitioner and then to decide it
in accordance with law. Needless to say that the
BCA shall be deemed to be pending before learned
Sessions Judge, Tank. Accused/petitioner be also
released in the manner while he will remain on bail
till the decision by Sessions Judge, Tank in BCA, on
the strength of bail bond already submitted pursuant
to order dated 25.5.2016 of Civil Judge/Judicial
Magistrate-I, Tank. This order is made by invoking
provisions of Section 439, Cr.P.C., as the impugned
order is incorrect, illegal and against administration
of criminal justice.
