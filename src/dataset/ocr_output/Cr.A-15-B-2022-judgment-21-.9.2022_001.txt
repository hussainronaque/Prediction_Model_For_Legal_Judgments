SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.--- Through the instant

appeal under section 410 Cr.P.C, appellants, namely, Abdur
Rahim, Majeed Khan and Abdul Haleem alias Siyal have
called in question the judgment dated 15.01.2022 passed by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Banda Daud Shah,
District Karak in case FIR No.211 dated 02.08.2019 under
sections 302/324/337-F(iii)/337-A(vi)/34 PPC registered at
Police Station Gurguri, District Karak, whereby, they were
convicted and sentenced as under:

i. Under section 302(b)/34 PPC to
imprisonment for life alongwith
payment of Rs.1,00,000/- each as
compensation to the legal heirs of

deceased under section 544-A Cr.P.C
or in default thereof, to undergo six

months simple imprisonment.

ii. Under section 324 PPC to five years
RL

iii. Under section 337-A(i)/34 PPC to
payment of Daman of Rs.50,000/-
each to injured Muhammad
Abdullah or in default thereto, to be
dealt with under séction 337-Y (ii)
PPC;

2. Benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to
the appellants and the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently. As far as charges under section 337-F(iii)
PPC/34 PPC were concerned, the appellants were acquitted
of the same.

3. Feeling aggrieved, the appellants have questioned the
legality of the impugned judgment and the awarded
sentences through the instant appeal, whereas, father of
deceased namely Muhammad Jumaraz being aggrieved of
the quantum of sentences has moved Criminal Revision
Petition No.06-B of 2022 for enhancement of the same.
Since both these matters have arisen out of the same
judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same through

this common judgment. i
4. The transient facts as unfolded in the first
information report are that on 01.08.2019 at 00:25 hours i.e.
12:25 AM, deceased then injured' Sabir Ullah alongwith
injured Syed Rahim lodged a report in emergency ward of
Civil Hospital, Teri, District Karak to the effect that on the
eventful day at 23:15 hours, he alongwith his friend Syed
Rahim, his brother injured Muhammad Abdullah, Attaullah
and Masood Rehman were present in their Baitak after
taken dinner. Meanwhile, accused Abdul Haleem alias
Siyal, Majeed, Ramzan, and Abdur Rahim armed with
Kalashnikovs came there and started firing at them in order
to commit their Qatl-i-Amd, due to which, he alongwith
Syed Rahim and Muhammad Abdullah got hit and injured,
while Masood Rehman and Atta Ullah luckily escaped
unhurt. Motive is stated to be a dispute over womenfolk.
Hence, the ibid FIR.

5. Accused Ramzan remained absconder, while on
arrest of the appellants after completion of investigation,
supplementary challan was submitted against them, where
at the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as 14 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence, statements of appellants were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed innocence and

false implication, however, neither they opted to be
examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C
nor wished to produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments, the learned trial Court vide the impugned
judgment, convicted and sentenced the appellants as
mentioned above. Hence, the instant appeal against the
judgment of conviction and the criminal revision for
enhancement of the sentence.

6. Learned counsel for the parties as well as the worthy
Additional Advocate General were heard at length and the
record was scanned through, with their valuable assistance.
7. The unfortunate incident claimed the life of one,
leaving behind two others injured. The matter was reported
by the deceased then injured, when he was rushed to the
hospital for treatment. The matter was reported to one
Samiullah ASI, who was examined as PW-01. The report
was noted down in the shape of murasila and thereafter, the
injury sheets were prepared. The injured were examined by
the doctor and after examination their medico legal
certificates were prepared. The deceased then injured, after
getting first aid, was referred for specialized treatment to
Peshawar, where he survived for several days, but at last,
succumbed to the injuries and section 302 PPC was added
to the first information report. The murasila was sent to

police station Teri for registration of the case, which
i
yielded to the present FIR. The investigating officer after

receiving copy of the FIR visited the spot and prepared the
site plan, on pointation of the eye witnesses. During spot
inspection, the investigating officer collected bloodstained
earth from respective places of the injured and the
Hy
deceased. It is pertinent to mention that 77 empties of 7.62
bore alongwith 05 empties of .30 bore were handed over to
the investigating officer by PW Masood Rehman. We deem
it essential to mention that on the day of incident, no bulb
was collected from the spot by the investigating officer, but
,

it was on 02.09.2019, when the same were taken into
possession by the investigating officer, as an application
was submitted by father of the complainant to the SP
(Investigation). The collected empties were sent to the
firearms expert for opinion and in that respect, a report was
received with an opinion that the same were fired from
different weapons. After completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the Court. The
accused were arrested soon after the incident and they were
presented to the Court concerned, where the trial
commenced and on its conclusion, the appellants were
convicted and sentenced as stated above.

8. The matter was heard and thrashed by the learned

trial judge and after application of his judicial mind to the
collected evidence on file and recorded statements of the
witnesses before the Court, convicted and sentenced the
appellants. This being the Court of appeal is under the
bounden duty to scan through the record with the sole
purpose to ascertain as to whether the approach of the
learned trial Court was correct by holding the convict /
appellants responsible for the death of the deceased and
injuries to the injured. This Court is to reassess and re-
appreciate the already assessed and appreciated evidence,
so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. The courts
of law are the custodians of the rights and liberties of the
people, so these are to walk with care while determining the
rights and liabilities of the parties, to be more specific, a
balance must be maintained between the parties, so that
miscarriage of justice could be avoided.

9. This Court is to determine as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time; as to
whether the witnesses were present at the time of incident
and thereafter; as to whether the incident occurred inside
the Baitak belonging to the complainant and as to whether
the prosecution succeeded in proving the motive and guilt
of the appellants to the hilt. This Court is to determine as to
whether the complainant was capable to talk and as to

whether the dying declaration is in line with the prosecution
story and statements recorded by the witnesses, before the
trial Court. There is no denial of the fact that the incident
occurred inside the Baitak belonging to the complainant and
the record also tells that the house of the convict /
appellants is situated just across the street. It is the case of
the prosecution that on the night of incident after taking
dinner, they were busy in chat, when the convict /
appellants attracted to the spot and started firing at them;
that soon after noticing the arrival of accused to the Baitak,
the complainant and the eye witnesses started running in
different directions, who, as a result of the fire shots,
received firearm injuries on their bodies; that the accused
soon after the incident decamped from the spot and that the
injured were shifted to the xhospital for medical
examination. The prosecution examined three eye witnesses
in support of its claim. Muhammad Abdullah alias
Muhammad Nawaz was examined as PW-12, who stated
that after taking dinner, the accused attracted to the spot
with Kalashnikovs and pistols, in their possession, and
started firing at them. We are to ascertain as to whether in
fact the complainant, the injured and the witnesses were
present in the Baitak right from the evening till the incident
occurred. All the three witnesses i.e. PW-12, 13 & 14 were

examined and cross examined on material aspects of the
case. PW-12 when appeared before the trial Court, he in his
examination in chief, improved his version to the extent that
besides Kalashnikovs, the accused were also armed with
pistols. This witness could not explain that who, out of the
accused, were armed with Kalashnikovs and who, with
pistols. When the statement of this witness is taken into
juxtaposition with the report of the complainant and his 161
Cr.P.C statement recorded by the investigating officer, he
remained silent regarding the pistols, in possession of the
accused. This is surprising to note that the introduction of
pistols was a conscious attempt on part of the witnesses, as
from the spot, alongwith 77 empties of 7.62 bore, 05
empties of .30 bore were also taken into possession. The
witnesses went in a constant struggle to accommodate their
improvement, in the prosecution story. We were further
surprised when PW-13 appeared before the trial Court and
explained the situation in a different manner. This witness
attributed pistols to accused Majeed, Abdur Rahim and
Ramzan. When the witness was cross examined regarding
the firing made by the accused, he explained in the
following manner:

“That only two out of the accused i.e. Abdur Rahim and
Ramzan were having pistols in :their possession.” He

further explained that accused Ramzan made three fire
shots with his pistols, but no one was hit. In respect of
Abdur Rahim, he disclosed that he made two fire shots with
his pistol, but no one was hit. This witness went a step
ahead and answered to a question that accused Abdul
Haleem was having no pistol in possession. PW-14 when
appeared before the Court, he was asked regarding the
weapons, in possession of the accused, who disclosed that
out of the accused, Syed Rahim was having pistol in
possession, whereas, others were armed with Kalashnikovs,
but even when the investigating officer recorded his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C, he did not mention the
availability of pistols with the accused, but he improved his
statement when appeared before the trial Court. It was in
his examination in chief that he introduced pistols with the
accused. The conflict among the witnesses on this particular
aspect of the case has created a dent in the prosecution case,
which, despite efforts, could not be repaired. We are
anxious to know that when in the report, made by the
complainant, the firearms, in possession of the accused,
were mentioned as Kalashnikovs then what led the
witnesses to travel in a different direction. If we, for a
while, admit that yes 05 empties of .30 bore were collected
from the spot, then it is for the prosecution to answer that

who fired those shots. As admittedly, the witnesses could
-10-

not prove this particular aspect of the case, then an
inference can be drawn that the same were fired by the
complainant side and when such an inference is drawn, then
it creates doubt in a prudent mind regarding the manner in
which the incident occurred. We cannot forget that the
Baitak, where the incident occurred, is smaller in size,
bounded by walls with a main gaie installed towards the
street. If, for a while, we accept that the accused entered the
premises and fired all 77 bullets of 7.62 bore, that too, with
Kalashnikovs alongwith 05 rounds of .30 bore, then there
must have been multiple bullet marks on the surrounding
walls, but the investigating officer, during spot inspection,
did not observe the same and even, no spent bullets were
collected therefrom. Though, one of the marginal witness
wanted to persuade this Court in respect of non-availability
of bullet marks on the walls by stating that the walls were
made up of stones. Even, if we say yes, to what he stated
before the Court, then in that eventuality, multiple spent
bullets would have been recovered, as the same would have
been deflected after striking the walls. This particular
aspect of the case can better be understood when the seat of
injuries on persons of the deceased and injured are taken
into consideration. The respective medico legal certificates

of the witnesses disclose that all the three received, single
-ll-

firearm entry, on their bodies. Another intriguing aspect of .
the case is that as per statement of the witnesses, soon the
accused entered the Baitak, the eye witnesses, the
complainant and the injured witnesses started running. The
medical evidence, if taken into consideration, belies the
stance of the prosecution, as in the given circumstances of
the present case, the victims would have received multiple
firearm injuries on their bodies. The site plan depicts the
respective places of the complainant side before the
incident and thereafter. The site plan discloses that when
allegedly, the accused fired at the victims, they started
running. One of the injured ran from point No.1 and when
he reached to point No.1A, he received a firearm injury and
similarly, the other when reached to point No.2A, he was
hit with a bullet, whereas, the injured Syed Rahim started
running towards the main gate, where he received an injury
on his body. This is beyond uriderstanding that when
accused fired after entering the main gate of the Baitak,
then what led the injured Syed Rahim to start running
towards the gate, as by then, all the accused were duly
armed with sophisticated weapons, present in the gate, but
the circumstances do not support the eye witness account
regarding the manner in which the incident occurred. The

witnesses remained inconsistent regarding the time they got
-12-

together in the Baitak and the time, when they took their
meal. Some of the witnesses disclosed before the trial Court
that they took dinner at 09:00 PM to 09:30 PM, whereas,
the other mentioned the time of taking dinner as 10:30 PM
to 11:00 PM. This is for the prosecution to tell that if the
meal was taken before the incident, then why the crockery
used for the purpose was not taken into possession.
Surprising statements are given by the witnesses, as some
of them stated before the trial Court that they were sitting
on chairs and the cots were lying inside the room, whereas,
some disclosed that there were no cots and chairs in the
Baitak, rather the meal was taken on a mat spread on the
floor, but in all circumstances, neither the cots nor the
chairs were taken into possession nor shown by the
investigating officer in the site plan, prepared on pointation
of the eye witnesses. The investigating officer did not ask
for the mat used for the purpose and in such eventuality, we
lurk no doubt in mind that the prosecution could not
succeed in convincing, that they had grouped together to
dine. When the very purpose of their presence in the Baitak
is not established on record then what would persuade the
judicial mind of this Court in holding that the incident
occurred inthemanneras alleged by the prosecution. This is
surprising to note that when PW-14 during his cross-

i
-13-

examination, disclosed that at | the time of firing,
announcement was made in the loudspeaker of the local
mosque and on hearing the same, the people of the locality
rushed towards the premises. When the incident occurred at
spur of the moment, then what opportunity was gained by
the locals to make announcement in the loudspeaker. If this
part of the statement of the witness is taken to be correct,
then it tells another story. The circumstances do suggest
that there was cross firing for a considerable long time and
the people were left with the ‘only choice to make
announcement through the loudspeaker of the mosque.
When the witnesses were cross examined in respect of the
pistols, in possession of the accused / appellants, it was
categorically admitted that one of the convict / appellant
Syed Rahim did not fire with the pistol in his possession.
When such is the state of affairs, then we are surprised to
note that how the said accused could be held responsible,
that too, when no effective role of firing was given to him,
through the pistol in his possession. The learned counsel for
the complainant wanted to convince this Court by
submitting that all the accused were in possession of
Kalashnikovs as well as pistols. Even, this limb of
arguments of the learned counsel failed to convince us, as it

has never been the case of the prosecution, that the accused

t
-14-

charged in the FIR, were armed with Kalashnikovs and
pistols. The improvements made by the witnesses, on this
aspect of the case, has damaged the prosecution case
beyond repair. It does not appeal to a prudent mind that the
accused, if come, in that fashion, would use both
Kalashnikovs and pistols, in their individual possession. In
the like circumstances, when the best available weapon is in
possession of an accused, then the use of pistol would speak
nothing, but mala fide on part of the prosecution. It is well
settled exposition of law that when the Court finds
inconsistencies, contradictions, and improvements in the
prosecution evidence and when it reaches to a conclusion
that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner as alleged and presented by the prosecution, then
the benefit has always been extended to the accused
charged. In this regard, wisdom can be derived case laws
reported as “Jawad Vs The State and another” (2020 YLR
1462) and “Jalat Khan alias Jalo Vs The State” (2020
PCrLJ 503). Similarly, in case titled “Rafaat Shah Vs The
State” (2022 PCr.LJ Note 39 Balochistan) it was held that:

“The mode and manner of the
occurrence itself by the prosecution is
not appealable to the prudent mined,
therefore, it was highly unsafe to rely
on the statement of both these
-15-

witnesses to maintain conviction and
sentence of the accused on a capital
charge.”

10. The investigating officer was examined as PW-03,
who stated that on receiving copy of the FIR, he alongwith
police officials went to the spot; that on arrival to the spot,
he found the eye witness Masood Rehman present there
alongwith the eye witness Attaulle; that Masood Rehman
handed him over 77 empties of 7.62 bore and 05 empties of
.30 bore; that the site plan was prepared on pointation of the
eye witnesses and their statements under section 161 Cr.P.C
were recorded. It is essential to note that another witness
namely Gul Samad also accompanied the investigating
officer from police station to the spot. He was examined as
PW-11, who stated that on the night of incident, he
alongwith the investigating officer was present in the police
station; that on hearing the fire shots, the investigating
officer directed them to go to the spot. The statement of this
witness when taken into consideration, gives an inference
that the investigating officer alongwith PW-11 and others
had reached to the spot earlier than the matter was reported.
We cannot ignore that the empties were not recovered from
the spot, rather the same were handed over by PW Masood

Rehman. This is for the prosecution to tell that when and
ea

-16-

why these empties were collected by PW Masood Rehman
from the spot. The marginal | witness i.e. PW-11
categorically stated that no sooner did they enter the Baitak,
the empties were handed over. He further explained that in
his presence, neither the investigating officer nor PW
Masood Rehman collected the same from the spot. When
such is the integrity of the witnesses and when such is the
recoveries from the spot, then the same cannot be taken into
consideration.

11. We are yet to know that what was the exact time of
arrival of the injured to the hospital and that as to whether
the injured were examined earlier or the report was made.
The medico legal certificates of all the injured disclose the
time of arrival and examination by the doctor as 11:45 PM,
whereas, the time of report is 00:25 i.e. 12:25 AM. When
the scribe was examined as PW-01, he explained in the
following manner:

“That on arrival to the hospital, first the matter was
reported to him, whereafter he prepared the injury sheets
and the injured were sent to the doctor for treatment and
examination.” Now, to ascertain that who was correct i.e.
the doctor or the scribe, for this:particular purpose, we
deem it essential to go through the statement of the scribe,

who appeared before the trial Court and was examined as
-17-

PW-01. This witness explained before the Court that while
on Gasht in Gurguri Bazaar, he received information
regarding the arrival of the injured to the hospital and he
rushed there, where the complainant reported the matter;
that after drafting the murasila, the same was sent through
constable Akhter Ghani to the concerned police station for
registration of the case. This is astonishing that how PW
Samiullah reached to the hospital and that it was he, who
drafted the murasila, because he was not posted in the
concerned police station, rather he was posted in police
station Gurguri. We are yet to know that why it took
sufficient long time to incorporate the murasila in the FIR
despite the fact that hospital and police station are situated
in close proximity. This particular aspect of the case can be
interpreted in no other manner, but that the report was made
after a considerable delay, that too, to provide an
opportunity to the complainant side to charge the persons of
their choice. The scribe, during his cross examination,
disclosed that the injury sheets are not in his writing, rather
those were prepared on his dictation. In the same breath, he
explained that the murasila is in his handwriting. When he
was available in the hospital, then why he himself failed to
prepare the injury sheets and that why he only opted to draft

the murasila. The record is silent that who was the police
-18-

official, who prepared the injury sheets on dictation of the
scribe. Neither the name of the said official is available in
the calendar of witnesses nor he was produced before the
trial Court. When this explanation is read in juxtaposition
with the time of arrival and time of report, no ambiguity is
left that before arrival of the police officials, the co-
villagers had brought the injured to the hospital and on their
arrival, their medical examination was carried out. It further
tells that till that time, no report was made. When such is
the state of affairs, we are not hesitant in holding that
preliminary investigating was conducted in the present case.
12. Another intriguing aspect of the case is the belated
recovery of two bulbs, allegedly, installed on the premises
at the time of occurrence. Though, the investigating officer
visited the spot, prepared the site plan, but he failed to
mention the availability of lights, on the walls, at the time
of incident. When the same was not taken into possession
on the night of incident, we are afraid that the prosecution
failed to disclose the source of identification. On realizing
the fact, it was disclosed that an application was submitted
by father of the complainant to SP (Investigation),
requesting for recovery of the bulbs. from the premises. The
investigating officer, after a month of the incident, went to

the spot once again, collected the bulbs installed in the
-19-

premises. When the investigating officer was asked as to
whether copy of the said application was available on file,
to which, he replied in negative. Neither father of the
complainant was examined on this particular aspect of the
case nor the application was brought on record, which tells
that the complainant side, after realizing this fact, tried its
level best to bring on record the source of identification.
Such belated recovery cannot be read in favour of the
prosecution, as in that eventuality, these are the convict
appellants who are to suffer at the hands of the prosecution
and even, for its negligence, so we are not in a happy mood
to accept the same.

13. Another essential aspect of the case is non-
production of the injured Syed Rahim. The prosecution
abandoned him being won over, but nothing was brought
on record that what were the circumstances, which led the
prosecution to decide in this fashion. We cannot ignore that
injured Syed Rahim was not closely related to the
complainant side and his statement was of prime
importance, not only that he received injuries in the
episode, but also that he would depose against the real
culprits. As he was the best available witness and it was he
who would explain the circumstances in which the incident

occurred, so the choice exercised sy the prosecution will
-20-

go deep to the roots of it’s case. The Legislature was
conscious of the like circumstance, that’s why Article
129(g) was made an essential component of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984. Keeping in view the attitude of the
prosecution and the refusal to examine the best available
evidence, we can draw an inference that he was not ready to
support false claim of the complainant and in such
eventuality, a negative inference is drawn. In this regard,
wisdom could also be derived from the judgment rendered
by the Apex Court in case titled “Lal Khan Vs The State”
(2006 SCMR 1846) in which it was held that:

“The prosecution is certainly not
required to produce a number of
witnesses as the quality and not the
quantity of the evidence is the rule but
non-production of most natural and
material witnesses of occurrence,
would strongly lead to an inference of
prosecutorial misconduct which would
not only be considered a source of
undue advantage for possession but
also an act of suppression of material
facts causing prejudice to the accused.
The act of withholding of most natural
and a material witness of the
occurrence would _ create an
impression that the Witness if would

have been brought into witness-box,
Mw

-21-

he might not have supported the
prosecution and in such eventuality
the prosecution must not be in a
position to avoid the consequence. ”»

14. The medical evidence does not run in unison with the
ocular account, as it is alleged that no sooner did the
accused enter the premises, they started firing at the
complainant and others. If we admit, for a while, the stance
of the witnesses, then the victims would have received
firearm injuries from their front, but it is not the case before
us. In case of burst firing, all the three would have received
multiple firearm injuries, but the seat of injuries and its kind
do not tally with the ocular account. The conflict between
the two has damaged the prosecution case beyond repair.
True that medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and
that in case of direct ocular account, the same plays a little
role, but we cannot forget that once the ocular account fails
to inspire confidence, then it is the medical evidence which
would steer the wheel. As in the present case, the witnesses
failed to convince this Court regarding the mode and
manner in which the incident occurred, so this Court is not
ready to interpret the same in favour of the prosecution,
rather the benefit of the same must go to the accused
charged. The circumstances so nerrated have established

that the ocular account is not in line with the medical
-22-

evidence. Similar situations, where medical evidence was in
conflict with the ocular account, have been beautifully dealt
with by this Court in a number of cases and the benefit so

accrued was extended in favour of accused charged. In this
i

regard, reference could be made to the judgment rendered
in the case of “Mukhtasir and 05 others Vs the State and
another” (2017 PCrLJ 1607 Peshawar). Similarly, the
Apex Court while dealing with the issue of conflict between
medical evidence and ocular account in the case of “Bashir
Muhammad Khan Vs The State” 2022 SCMR 986) was
pleased to hold as under:

“The medical evidence is inconsistent
with the ocular account as regards
injury No. 3 on the right hip of the
deceased is concerned, which in-fact
was an exit wound but according to
the prosecution witnesses of ocular
account the same was an entry
wound in these circumstances, a dent
in the prosecution's case has been
created, benefit of which must be
given to the appellant. It is a settled
law that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of accused makes him
entitled to its benefits, not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a

matter of right. The conviction must
Ce

-23-

be based on unimpeachable;
trustworthy and reliable evidence.
Any doubt arising in prosecution's
case is to be resolved ‘in favour of the
accused and burden of proof is
always on prosecution to prove its
case beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt. However, as discussed above,
in the present case the prosecution
has failed to prove its case beyond
any reasonable shadow of doubt.”

15. It was argued by the learned counsel for the
complainant that the investigating officer collected 77
empties of 7.62 bore from the spot alongwith 05 empties of

.30 bore and that after chemical analysis, the same were

:
Fd

opined to have been fired from dif-erent weapons and that
this piece of evidence can be taken in support of the
prosecution, as a corroborative piece of evidence, however,
our anxiety is not the positive report, rather we are anxious
to know that wherefrom the empties were collected. When
the investigating officer categorically stated that on arrival
to the spot, the same were handed over by PW Masood
Rehman, so we are confident enough that the prosecution
has lost this precious piece of evidence. Record tells that 77
empties of 7.62 and 05 empties of .30 bore were allegedly

picked and collected from the spt by the PW Masood
-24-

Rehman, to appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we
once again want to revisit the statement of PW Masood
Rehman. This witness when appeared before the trial Court
stated that after the injured were picked from the spot for
the hospital, he collected a motorbike from his friend and
went to the hospital, where in his presence, the complainant
reported the matter and he verified the same. This is for the
prosecution to tell, that when this witness reached to the
spot from the hospital? In order to appreciate this particular
aspect, we would like to go through the statement of PW
Gul Samad, who stated that on hearing the fire shots, the
investigating officer asked them to leave for the spot, this
witness further explained that they reached to the spot in a
vehicle within 10 to 20 minutes. As by then, the report had
not been made, then how PW Masood Rehman was present
on the spot, as he was the witness, who verified the report
of the complainant and the report was made at 00:25 hours
i.e. 12:25 AM. When the statements of these two witnesses
are read together, it gives an inference that the empties were
neither produced to the investigating officer on the night of
incident nor those were collected from the spot by PW
Masood Rehman. When such is the state of affairs, the

positive laboratory report hardly plays a role to
-25-

favour the prosecution. This piece of evidence cannot be
taken into consideration as it has lost its evidentiary value.

16. This Court is conscious of the fact that the report was
made by the deceased then injured, but it is for the
prosecution to convince that at the time of report, the
deceased was capable to talk. True that the deceased then
injured received a solitary injury on‘his abdomen, which led
to his death after several days of the incident, but that alone
cannot be taken into consideration, that too, for
confirmation of the fact that the deceased, by then, was
oriented in time and space, and that he was capable to talk.
In order to dilate upon this particular aspect of the case, we
deem it essential to revisit the statements of the scribe, who
was examined as PW-01 and the doctor who was examined
as PW-08. The scribe appeared before the trial Court, he
stated that on reaching to the hospital, the deceased then
injured alongwith the injured witnesses was available in the
hospital and the doctor was busy in his treatment. When the
doctor was available, as disclosed by the scribe, then what
precluded the scribe to ask for a report regarding the
physical status of the deceased then injured. We are
surprised to see that neither the scrive, at the time of report,
mentioned as to whether the deceased then injured was

capable to talk and as to whether he understood the
-26-

proceedings conducted. Even, the scribe, in his cross
examination, made his presence doubtful, as he stated
before the Court that he, by himself, did not prepare the
injury sheets of the deceased theri injured as well as the
injured witnesses. In the same breath, he explained that the
injury sheets were prepared on his dictation, but
surprisingly, no witness, in that respect, has been produced.
As discussed in earlier part of this judgment that the arrival
of the scribe to the hospital at the relevant time does not
appeal to mind, as the report was allegedly made to him and
it was he who recorded the same, so the injury sheets
should have been prepared by him. This particular aspect of
the case makes this Court to hold that the report was penned
down after providing an opportunity to the witnesses to
appear, consult and charge. The doctor was examined as
PW-08, but even, he remained silent regarding the
capability, of the deceased then injured to talk and even, he
failed to confirm that any certificate was asked from him or
that he endorsed the report made by the complainant. True
that the deceased then injured remained alive for several
days and that there was every possibility that thereafter, he
remained oriented in time and space, but this Court is to
determine as to whether the complainant at the time of

report, was fully conscious and as to whether it was he who
-27-

reported the matter. We lurk no doubt in mind that the
prosecution failed on this particular aspect of the case and
even, nothing could be gathered from the record to confirm
that at the time of report, the deceased then injured was
capable to talk. If, for the sake of arguments, we say yes, to
what the prosecution submitted, then in that eventuality, we
are to assess the worth, veracity and sanctity of the
statement of the complainant, in juxtaposition with the
statements recorded by the witnesses. We cannot forget that
dying declaration is a weak kind of evidence, which needs
corroboration, that too, from independent sources, but in the
instant case, when the witnesses failed to establish their
presence on the spot and when the witnesses could not
succeed to convince this Court regarding the mode, manner
and time of occurrence, then we ere afraid that the same
cannot be read in support of the dying declaration. When
both, that too, the most particular aspects of the case went
in conflict, then it is hard for this Court to hold that the
dying declaration, in isolation is sufficient for awarding
conviction. On one hand, the eye witness account has been
disbelieved, whereas, on the other, the circumstantial
evidence, in the shape of recoveries from the spot, was
discarded, so in the prevailing circumstances of the present

case, the dying declaration in itself has lost its efficacy, to
-28-

be used for conviction of the accused charged. We are not
hesitant in holding that the learned trial judge could not
comprehend these crucial aspects of the case and as such,
fell in error, which resulted in miscarriage of justice. It is
settled law that dying declaration by itself is a weaker
type of evidence, which needs corroboration through
confidence inspiring evidence. In this regard, wisdom
could be derived from the judgment rendered by the Apex
Court in the case of "Tahir Khan v. The State" (2011
SCMR 646) in which it was held that:

"Mere dying declaration shrouded by
mystery and fraught with so many
infirmities is not enough to convict a
person. Dying declaration is weaker
type of evidence, which needs
corroboration when fully
corroborated by other reliable
evidence. Facts and circumstances of
each case have to be kept in view and
also credibility, reliability and
acceptability of such declaration by
Court."

17. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above
leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the prosecution
could not succeed in bringing home guilt against the
appellants and that the impugned judgment is suffering

from inherent defects, which calls for interference. The

learned trial judge while appreciating the available record
misdirected himself both in law and on facts of the case.
We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the impugned
judgment. The appellants Abdur Rahim, Majeed Khan, and
Abdul Haleem alias Siyal are acquitted of the charges, they
shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.
18. As the prosecution has failed to prove the charges
against the appellants beyond reasonable doubts and since
the instant criminal appeal ended in acquittal, so the
Criminal Revision Petition No.06-B of 2022 for
enhancement of sentence fails in the circumstances and is
dismissed as such.
19, The above are the detailed reasons for our short order
of even date. {
