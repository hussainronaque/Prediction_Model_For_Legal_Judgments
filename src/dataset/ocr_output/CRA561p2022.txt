sere
SHAHID KHAN, J. The instant appeal is
directed against the judgment and order dated
21.09.2021, whereby the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II/ Judge, Special Court,
Khyber, confiscated the vehicle, Motorcar
Mehran (white in color) bearing registration
No.AHY-746-ICT, having Chassis

was involved in case FIR No.252 dated
21.10.2020, w/s 9(D) CNSA, 170/171 PPC,
Police Station, Jamrud.

2. Facts in short are that the police
patrolling party under the command of Yar Jan
SI with Watan HC, Mohib HC, Ajmal FC,

Gohar FC & Hazrat FC was on the routine
patrolling duty, received an information
regarding trafficking of narcotics as heroin
through vehicle, Mehran bearing registration
No AHY-746-ICT. It was _ intercepted,
whereas, it’s driver in a police uniform and its
search led to the recovery of 14 packets heroin
each weighing 1000 grams (Net weighing 14
kg).

3. After registration of the event and
completion of investigation, challan was
drafted and sent for trial.

4. During the trial prosecution
placed reliance on the account/testimony of 03
PWs, whereof, the defence through an
application u/s 265-K Cr.P.C sought acquittal
of the accused.

5. The learned trial Court after
hearing learned defence counsel and learned
Prosecutor, arrived at the conclusion that there
is no chance and probability of the conviction
of the accused, as such, exercising jurisdiction
ws 265-K Cr.P.C, recorded acquittal of the
accused vide judgment dated 21.09.2021.

6. Rizwan Ullah, the appellant

approached this Court to the subject appeal u/s
24 of the CNSA, 2019 against the judgment of
the learned trial Court to the extent of
confiscation of the vehicle/ Motorcar Mehran
(white in color) bearing registration No.AHY-
746-ICT, Chassis No.SB308PK01258661.

7. Learned counsel for the appellant
argued that his client is the bonafide owner by
purchase of the subject vehicle and was not in
knowledge at all regarding the use of the
vehicle in question by the accused in the
commission of offence. During the
investigation, an iota of evidence has not been
collected to be produced before the Court to
substantiate a remote nexus of the petitioner in
the commission of offence. The order of
confiscation of the subject vehicle by the
learned trial Court is against the law on subject
on the ground that fair chance and opportunity
has not been provided to the actual
owner/claimant/appellant regarding his
bonafide and to have no concerned whatsoever
with the subject bid. Concluded, on acceptance
of the appeal in hand the impugned judgment
of the learned trial Court to the extent of

confiscation of the vehicle in question may
Q..

please be set aside and return of the subject
vehicle to the appellant shall meet the ends of
justice.

8. Learned AAG rebutted the stance
& contention of the appellant with due
vehemence that after deep slumber, the
appellant realized to ask return of the subject
vehicle. No effort whatsoever has been
attempted at the first stage i.e. investigation to
approach the investigation officer with the
relevant documents of the subject vehicle so
that his stance could have been highlighted in
the investigation notes. Added, the appellant
had not taken the pain to in time approach the
then learned trial Court for appropriate remedy
in accordance with law. Concluded, the
afterthought of the appellant is against the law
and needs to be regretted accordingly.

9. Close perusal of the record would
transpire that 14 packets of heroin (net
weighing 14 kg) has been secured & recovered
from the trunk of the vehicle under the
command & control of accused Akram Khan.
The Court is confronted only with the request

of the appellant for the return of the subject
vehicle, therefore, it would be appropriate to
focus only on the subject request.

10. There is no denial at all that
notice under section 33 (proviso) CNSA, 1997
is mandatory to the claimant of the vehicle
used in the commission of offence but in shall
not skip the attention of the Court that neither
at the earliest stage, pre investigation &
investigation, the appellant has never ever
floated his claim regarding ownership of the
vehicle in question before the quarter
concerned. Likewise, no claim in this regard
has been furnished during the trial before the
Court of competent jurisdiction. However,
Section 32 Sub section (2) of the Act speak
loud & clear of the confiscation of the vehicle
used in the commission of offence, however, it
is proved that it’s ostensible owner was well in
knowledge, directly or indirectly, of the bid
pertaining to the transportation & smuggling of
narcotics also permits the confiscation of the
vehicle, however, conscious knowledge of the
owner regarding the use of the subject vehicle
in the commission of offence is pre-requisite.

The alleged bonafide owner of the vehicle has
to be put on notice followed by giving a fair
chance of audience to him. The subject
preposition has been highlighted in the case of
“Muhammad Amin Vs the State reported in
PLD-2004-Karachi-482”, and in an un
reported judgment of this Court in QP No.32
of 2006 _titled State through Director ANF,

Peshawar_Vs__Abdul__Qadeer _Paracha”
decided on 27.03.2008.

11. Admittedly, no notice as
envisaged under the Act ibid was given to
appellant by the learned Trial Court thus the
order of confiscation of the vehicle is to be
struck down on this sole ground.

12. Moreover, Trial Court is bound to
look for the mens-rea on the part of appellant
or any contribution made by him. Record is
silent as to whether any query or probe is made
by raiding party or Investigation Officer to
trace out that appellant had any knowledge of
transporting the narcotics. Provisions of
sections 32 & 33 of the CNSA, 1997 is
beneficial enactment to safeguard the right of

innocent owner. To penalize a person in
absence of mens-rea would be unjust and

confiscation of the vehicle would be harsh.

13. In view of the facts and
circumstances of the case the appeal in hand is
allowed, the impugned judgment of learned
trial Court dated 21.09.2021 is set aside to the
extent of confiscation of the vehicle in
question only and remand back the case to the
learned Trial Court with the directions to
proceed with the claim of the appellant
regarding the bonafide ownership of the
vehicle in question coupled with his direct or
indirect, active or dormant, involvement of the
appellant/claimant in the commission of
offence followed by an appropriate order
within the meaning section 32 read with
section 33 of CNSA, 1997.
