AHMAD _ALI, J. Through this common

judgment, we propose to decide the following
writ petitions having prayers mentioned against

each:-

WP _No. 785-P/2013 (Kausar Ali Shah Vs Regional Police
Officer etc)

“It is therefore, most humbly prayed that on
acceptance of this writ petition, FIR 113
dated 10.03.2013 u/s 506/307 PPC r/w 25
Telegraph Act, PS Sheikh Maltoon, District
Mardan may kindly be quashed/cancelled
being illegal, baseless/corum-non-judice and
lodged by the respondent No.4 only to harass
the petitioner mentally and to compel him

for illegal demands and compromise.”

WP No. 142-M/2013 (Kausar Ali Shah Vs Regional Police
Officer etc)

“It is therefore, most humbly prayed that on
acceptance of this writ petition, FIR 153
dated 13.03.2013 u/s —- 419/420/417/
468/471/489-F PPC, PS Jewar, District
Buner may kindly be quashed/cancelled
being illegal, baseless/ corum-non-judice and
lodged by the respondent No.4 only to harass
the petitioner mentally and to compel him

for illegal demands and compromise.”
WP _No._786-P/2013 (Kausar Ali Shah Vs Regional Police

Officer etc)

“It is therefore, most humbly prayed that on
acceptance of this writ petition, FIR 122
dated 12.03.2013 u/s 489-F PPC, PS Sheikh
Maltoon, District Mardan may kindly be
quashed/cancelled being illegal, baseless/
corum-non-judice and lodged by the
respondent No.4 only to harass the petitioner
mentally and to compel him for illegal
demands and compromise.”

WP No. 202-P/2014 (Syed Kausar Ali Shah and another Vs
‘ional Police Officer etc

“It is therefore, most humbly prayed that on
acceptance of this writ petition, FIR 29 dated
14.01.2014 u/s 342/347/109 PPC, PS Sheikh
Maltoon, District Mardan may kindly be
quashed/cancelled being illegal, baseless/
corum-non-judice and lodged by the
respondent No.4 only to harass the petitioner
mentally and to compel him for illegal

demands and compromise.”

WP_No, _2962-P/20 Aman Ullah Vs S sar_Ali

Shah etc)

“It is therefore, graciously prayed that while
accepting this writ petition, the impugned
order dated 08.11.2013 of the learned
respondent No.2 (ASJ-II, Mardan) may
please be declared illegal, without
jurisdiction and without any authority and
the respondent No.3 may please be
restrained from arrest of the petitioner”

2.  Perusal of previous order sheets reveals

that no one is appearing on behalf of the

petitioners since long, it seems that they are no

more interested in pursuing the instant petitions,

therefore, arguments of the learned AAG on

behalf of the official respondents heard and after
thorough perusal of record, the matters were

taken up for disposal on merit.

3. In all these petitions, filed under Article
199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have sought the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court to quash
the FIRs/proceedings there under. Without going
to the roots of the matter, suffice it to say, that
alternate remedy in the shape of application
under sections 249-A or 265-K Cr.P.C. is
available to the petitioners. They may avail this
remedy, if at all, the Trial Court proceed against
them. In case titled “Ghulam Muhammad Vs
Muzammil Khan” reported in (PLD 1967 S.C.
317), the apex Court held that remedy of
quashment of proceedings is not available, when
alternate remedy in the shape of 265-K or 249-A
Cr.P.C.is available. Wisdom could be safely

drawn from case laws reported in PLD 1992 S.C.

353, 2006 SCMR 276, 2006 SCMR 1192,

4. Moreover, the High Court has no
jurisdiction, whatsoever; to take the role of
investigation agency and to quash the FIR or any
proceedings there under, while exercising power

under Article 199 of the Constitution, unless and
until very exceptional circumstance exists.
Reliance could be safely placed on case titled
“Doctor Ghulam Mustafa Vs The State”
reported in 2008 SCMR 76.

5. In view of the above, the instant and

connected writ petitions are dismissed

accordingly.
