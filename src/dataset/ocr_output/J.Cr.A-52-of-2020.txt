conclusion of proceedings in the case, accused was
examined under section 342 Cr.P.C. The learned trial
Court convicted and sentenced the appellant vide
impugned judgment dated 19.12.2019, as stated earlier.
Appellant has filed instant appeal through

Superintendent Central Prison Mardan with an

application for appointment of a counsel for him. At the

time of disposal of said application (Cr.M No. 29-

M/2020) Barrister Asad-ur-Rahman volunteered that he

would conduct case of the appellant pro bono, and was

accordingly appointed as counsel for appellant.

5. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for appellant, learned State counsel and perused
the record.

6. Perusal of record reveals that other
co-accused namely Bahram Zay, Yousaf Shah, Syed
Zaman Shah, Muhammad Saeed and Zar Wali have been
acquitted on almost similar set of facts and evidence of
the prosecution. While differentiating case of the present
appellant for the purpose of his conviction and
sentences, learned trial Court has mentioned two factors
in Para 15 of the impugned judgment which are;

(a) That the appellant has recorded confessional
statement before the competent Court wherein he has
confessed to commission of the offence on 19.04.2017,

which was also found to have been corroborated by

NAWAB O08: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq {brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-

Pointation of _the place of stay documented vide
pointation memo Ex. PW-4/6 and pointation of the place
of occurrence documented vide pointation memo Ex.
PW-4/5,

(b); that the accused had remained absconder for
sufficient long period of time.

So far as confessional statement of the
appellant, is concerned, it is important to be noted that
the appellant was formally arrested in the instant case by
the Investigating Officer on 30.03.2017. He had earlier
been arrested at Karachi and after his arrest in the case in
hand he was shifted to District Buner for the purpose of
investigation in the present case. His confessional
statement has been recorded on 19.04.2017 i.e. after 20
days of his arrest in the case in hand. In reply to question
No. 8 of the questionnaire, he has stated that he had
remained in custody of the police at Karachi for 15 days
while his additional custody of 20 days had been
obtained by the Buner police. ‘Appellant had remained in
police custody for a total of 35 days but even if we count
his custody with Investigating Officer of the present
case, it was also not less than 20 days. The Magistrate
who had recorded confession of appellant had also stated
in his cross-examination while deposing as PW-9 that it
was correct that the appellant had remained in police

custody for almost 35 days.

NAWAB DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad *
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its
judgment in the case of “Asif Mahmood v/s The
State” reported as_ “2005 SCMR_ 315” has held that
Court must satisfy itself about truthfulness and
voluntary nature of a retracted confession, before
relying on it. Relevant part of observation of the
august Court is to the following effect;

“Confessional statement for being relied upon should
not only be true, voluntary and believable but should
be without fear, favour or any inducement.”

This Court in its earlier judgment in the

case of “Muhammad Israr and another v/s The State”

reported as 2002 P Cr. LJ 1072 had not treated the
confessional statement recorded after four days of
custody of accused as voluntary in nature. Similarly, in
the case of “Naseeb Zada v/s The State and another”
reported as “2019 YLR 2157” a confessional statement
recorded after 5 days of the occurrence was termed as
one recorded at a belated stage and was not found
voluntary in nature. In support of same ratio, further
reliance may also be placed on judgments reported as
1983_P Cr. LJ 882, 1983 P Cr. LJ 892, 1996
P_Cr. LJ 394, 2018 YLR_ 1629 and 2019 P Cr. LJ

1014.

Confession of the appellant in the case in
hand cannot be held to have been voluntarily recorded,
for the simple reason that the appellant had remained
in police custody for extra-ordinarily long time and the
element of coercion, threat and torture for procuring
his confession, may not be ruled out.

7. When the confessional statement of
appellant was not found to be worthy of reliance then
the corroboratory pieces of evidence like pointation of
the spot where the appellant had stayed or pointation
of the place of occurrence cannot be deemed sufficient
for conviction of the accused. Such places had already
been known to the Investigation Officer as pointed out
earlier by acquitted accused and there has been no new
discovery or recovery on pointation of the
accused/appellant, making it admissible under Article
40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. In this respect,
reliance is placed on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Hayatullah v/s The

State” reported as 2018 SCMR 2092, wherein it has

been held;

“It is astonishing that the trial court while recording the
statements of the witnesses (police officials) regarding the
confession before the police, recorded each and every word of
the appellant before the police and also exhibited the memo of
disclosure. The said statement before the police and the said
memo of disclosure were absolutely inadmissible hit by Article
39 of the Oanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. In order to give a
cover of Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the
investigating officer recovered a pistol on the same day and all

the witnesses claimed that thereafter the appellant pointed out
the place of occurrence and the place from where the dead-
body was earlier recovered. We are conscious of the fact that
after making such disclosure before the police no new fact
was discovered because it is already in the knowledge of the
police on 11.02.2006 that the deceased had received a bullet
injury and from the place of occurrence an empty of 30 bore
pistol was also recovered. So the recovery of pistol after the
Said disclosure was not a new fact or not a fact which was not
in the knowledge of police. Likewise, the place of occurrence
and the place where dead-body was thrown while dragging it
Jrom the said place, was already in the knowledge of the police
and such pointing out of the place after said disclosure is
worthless, irrelevant and inadmissible as the said place was
already in the knowledge of the police and a site plan of the
same place had already been prepared on 11.02.2006.”

8. So far as absconsion of appellant, is
concerned, it is well settled by now that absconsion
may be considered as a corroboratory circumstance in
support of other evidence of prosecution but when the
prosecution fails to establish its case on the basis of
reliable evidence, conviction may not be based on
mere absconsion of an accused. Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of “Rasool Muhammad v/s Asal
Muhammad and 3 others” reported as 1995 SCMR

1373 had held, in this respect;

“In their statements under section 342, Cr.P.C., while
explaining their alleged abscondence, they stated that prior to
the occurrence they had gone to Punjab for earning their
livelihood. On their return to the village they learnt about the
charge against them and they voluntarily appeared before the
police. Rehman Gul Constable P.W.3 who was deputed to
execute the warrants of arrest of Rashid Gul and Khan
Muhammad has stated that the people of area usually go to
Punjab for earning their livelihood. Furthermore,
disappearance of a person named as, a murderer /culprit after
the occurrence, is but natural, whether named rightly or
wrongly. Abscondence per se is not a proof of the guilt of an
accused person.

NAWAB DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

In support of same ratio further reliance
may also be placed on judgment of Hon’ble Apex
Court reported as 1986 SCMR 823.

9. In light of what has been discussed above,
it is clear that prosecution could not prove its case
against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. He is
therefore acquitted of commission of the offence by
extending him benefit of doubt. The instant appeal is
accordingly allowed and the accused/appellant was
ordered to be released from jail, if not required in any
other case. These are reasons for our short order of
even, which read as follows;

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow this appeal, set-
aside the judgment of conviction dated 19.12.2019 passed
by learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court-II Malakand
Division Swat Camp Court at Buner, in case FIR No. 233
dated 21.08.2011 registered under sections 324,
353,427,148,149 PPC read with section 5 of Explosive
Substances Act, 13 A.O, and section 7 ATA at Police
Station Chinglai District Buner and resultantly acquit the
appellant namely Abdul Ahad alias Idress son of
Said Hayat of the charges levelled against him. He be
released forthwith if not required in any other case.
