No.R-0336/Hyderabad, which was ordered to be dealt with in

accordance with law.

2. Facts of the case as spelt out from the FIR
Ex.PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex. PW 2/2, are

that on 09.6.2017, complainant Saifullah Khan S.H.O (PW-2)

alongwith police Nafri was present on the spot for snap _

checking, meanwhile a flying coach bearing registration
No.R-0336/Hyderabad arrived from Gurguri side which was
stopped on left side’ of the road. The driver was deboarded
therefrom, who disclosed his name as Rehmatullah son of
Ghulam Daud. During checking, 08 packets of Charas
Gardah were recovered from the secret cavities designed in
the rooftop of the said vehicle. On weighment, each packet
stood 1285 grams, making total 10280 grams Charas. Five
grams Charas was separated from each packet for chemical
analysis and sealed into parcel No.1 to 8, whereas the
remaining 10280 grams Charas was sealed in parcel No.9.
The flying coach was taken into possession and the accused

was booked for the offence vide FIR mentioned above.

3. On completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted before the learned trial Court. Accused
was charged for the’ offence to which he pleaded. not guilty

and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to prove its case

<t
produced and examined as many as five witnessef* :

whereafter, accused was examined under section 342 Cr.P.C,

wherein he professed innocence and false implication,

however, neither he opted to be examined under section
340(2) Cr.P.C.,- nor produced evidence in his defence.
Learned trial Coun, after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, vide impugned judgment dated
09.04.2019, convicted. appellant and sentenced him, as
mentioned above, which has been assailed by the convict as

well as Nasir Khan & another through these two appeals.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the appellant
and learned Addl: -A.G representing the State heard and

record perused with their valuable assistance.

5. It was on 09.6.2017, when. complainant
Saifullah Khan SHO (PW-2) alongwith police Nafri during
snap checking, stopped a flying coach bearing registration
No.R-0336/Hyderabad and deboarded the appellant
therefrom. During checking, 08 packets of Charas Gardah
were recovered from the secret cavities designed in the
rooftop of the said vehicle, which, on weighment stood 10280
grams Charas. While going through the evidence, we have
found material contradictions in the statements of the PWs
besides other discrepancies in the prosecution case, which
could not be highlighted by the trial Court. Saif Ullah Khan
SHO, while appearing as PW-2 in the witness box though
reiterated the contents of the murasila, however, he stated that
he took into possession flying coach from the driver, who was

not in possession 0 of the registration book. He admitted during

<1

© ort

cross examination that he did not remember the time of a0"

departure from police station to the spot. He stated that they
proceeded to the spot from police station in official vehicle
and continued checking for 30/40 minutes. This witness went
on to say that he had made an entry in respect of his departure
from police station to the spot in the daily diary, but the
Investigating Officer neither collected nor placed the extract
of the same on the police file. He admitted it correct that he
had not recorded the statements of passengers or any other
private witness. Contrary to the above, Muhammad Jabbar
LHC (PW-1), who “vas allégedly present with the seizing
officer, stated that the SHO went to the spot from police

,

station in a private vehicle, which runs in contrast to what the

scribe stated. We are surprised that statement of this witness,

particularly cross examination seems dubious, which runs as:-
“First I drafied Murasila and then prepared
the recovery memo in the instant case. At the
time of preparation of recovery memo Jabbar
LHC was present with me and had not
proceeded yet to police station. I sent Jabbar
LHC in a private vehicle for taking Murasila
to police station. I do not remember that after

how many hours the KB] incharge came to
the spot”.

This witness was almost confused, as what to
say and who to support and as such his testimony is not worth
reliance, which speaks nothing but that this witness was not

present with the SHO at the time of the alleged recovery.

Waheed ur Rehman HC, marginal witness to the
recovery memo Ex. PW 2/1, appeared in the witness box as

PW-3, who stated that at the time of intercepting, the flying

coach was having no passengers. Though he stated that the
murasila was taken to police station by Jabbar LHC at about
4:30 p.m, however, he failed to answer that what mode was
adopted by the said Jabbar LHC for taking murasila to the
police station. He stated that the Investigating Officer
alongwith FIR came to spot at about 5:00 p.m. He further
stated that they remained on the spot for about three hours.
Contrary to the above, Muhammad Naseer Moharrir (PW-4)
stated that the murasila was brought to police station by LHC
Jabbar at about 4:00/4:30 p.m. We are surprised to see that
how could the time. of collecting murasila from the Spot and
its handing over to the Moharrir in police station be one and
the same as the police station and the spot lies at a
considerable distance and this version has created a serious

dent in the prosecution case.

The present case was investigated by Shad
Akbar Khan SI, who was examined thrice ic. as PW-5,
RPW-2 and RPW-3, summoned on different occasions for
different purposes. The Investigating Officer and the marginal
witness Waheed ur Rehman did not toe the line and went
apart on material aspects of the case. PW-S5 stated that he
reached to the spot at 1725 hours, whereas PW-3 went

otherwise stating that it was 5:00 p.m. when the Investigating

’

fe eg cn

aie

Officer reached to the spot. The Investigating Officer further < €/

stated that the contraband Charas was handed over to him in ¢ net vor

sealed condition, but he himself did not feel the need to.see aS *

‘tk ce ov
to whether the recovered and sealed material was Charas. He
shocked us to say’ that the ‘recovery memo Ex. PW 2/1
prepared by the seizing Officer tells that the Charas. was in
powder form, whereas according to the laboratory report the

Charas recovered was in solid form, where in fact this witness

had never seen the contraband in open condition so he based .

his assessment both on the laboratory report and the recovery |

memo. When this is the state of affairs, that the Investigating
Officer was unaware and could not see as to whether the
recovery effected from the accused/appellant was of Charas
or otherwise and he based his opinion on the recovery memo
which was not prepared by him but by another police official,
then in circumstances the investigation so conducted will
definitely lose its veracity. The Investigating Officer happily
admitted that he had not weighed the contraband, The Court,
on application of the appellant re-summoned the Investigating
Officer to be examined on the recovery and ownership of the
vehicle, who appeared as RPW-3 and conceded that he did

not confirm the ownérship of the vehicle.

Gul Fayz No.214, while appearing as RPW-],
stated in cross examination that on 13.6.2017, the parcels of
samples were handéd over to him by the Moharrir on a

receipt, which is not’ “available on Court file as well as police

file. . : : pt re

6. The record is silent that when, how and who eee

handed over the prepared samples and the remaining case

et
property to the Moharrit of the police station as the
Investigating Officér did’ not bother to collect the abstract
from the Register No.19 and we were taken aback that the
Moharrir who was éxamined as PW-4, stated that he received

only the murasila Which he incorporated in the FIR, but he

did not mention asto whether the case property was also .

handed over to him or not and his this silence confirms us that

the case property was not lying in safe custody.

7. The alleged recovery was effected on 09.6.2017,
whereas the samples were received in the FSL on 13.6.2017,
but nothing is available on file to tell that where the samples
were lying during the intervening period and even PW-4 kept
mum on this aspect of the case being Moharrir of the police
station. The factum of recovery is further doubted when one
Gul Fayz was examined as RPW-1, who was the witness
who allegedly collected the test samples from the Moharrir
and handed over in the office of the Chemical Examiner.
When this witness was questioned as to whether any receipt
for taking the samples to the FSL was prepared and handed
over by the Mohatric. he answered in affirmative, but failed to
establish that the receipt was handed over to the Investigating

Officer to be placed on file and even today we after thorough

sh

search did not come across the same, yet we are surprised nat qt

wherefrom this witness collected the receipt when the

Moharrir of the poliée station when appeared as PW-4 did se

utter even a single word i in this respect, The overall impact of

TEP

R
sash Cav

the infirmities so erupted will put a heavy cost on the
prosecution and these infirmities have crept into the roots of
the case and such evidence cannot lead to conviction. We are
convinced that the , dispatch of the test samples from the
police station to the Forensic Science Laboratory has not been
established in the way and in the manner as is proposed by
the law. Hence, the FSL report so tendered cannot be

accepted and relied upon.

uy

In case titled Kamran Shah and others Vs. The

State and others (2019 SCMR 1217), it was held that:

It is not disputed that the narcotic
substance recovered in:this case had been
recovered from some secret cavities of a
vehicle in which the present appellants
were travelling at the relevant time as
passengers and the said vehicle was being
driven by Saeed Ahmed co-convict. It was,
thus, incumbent upon the prosecution to
establish conscious possession of the
contraband substance on the part of the
present appellants but no evidence worth
its name had ,been brought on the record
in that respect. The record of the case
shows that safe custody of the recovered
substance at the local Police Station had
not been established by the prosecution
during the trial. Muhammad Afzal,
Moharrir (PW3) had been produced by
the prosecution before the trial Court but
he had said nothing about receipt of the
case-property or its safe custody by him.
Even safe transmission of the samples of
the recovered substance from the local
Police Station to the office of the

Chemical Examiner had not been proved ax x

by the prosecution.

In this respect, cases reported as Abdul Ghani

& others Vs. Tlie state and others (2019 SCMR 608), The

S)

-9-

State through Regional Director ANF Vs. Imam Bakhsh

and others (2018 SCMR_ 2039) and Multan Jan Vs. State
.
(2020 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar 88), can well be referred.

8. The Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997
has provided stringent punishment for those involved and also
the law enforcing agencies have been put under a heavy
responsibility to bring solid and material evidence against the
accused and even: the laboratories concerned have been

provided a mechanism which they are to follow while

analyzing the test samples. The law as well as the apex Court -

time and again emphasized that while dealing with the test
samples and preparing the reports on its strength, the
concerned laboratories are under heavy obligation to adhere to
the procedure in this respect and especially to specify the
protocols of the test applied and this is the duty of the trial
Courts to examine ‘the contents of report and lo assess its
evidentiary valuc. In case tiled Jkramullah and others Vs.

The State (2015 SCMR 1002), it was held that:-

“We have wparticularly noticed that the
report submitted by the Chemical
Examiner (Exhibit-P.W.2/5) completely
Jailed to mention the basis upon which the
Chemical -Examiner had come to a
conclusion that the samples sent to him for
examination contained charas. According
to Rules 5 and 6 of the Control of Narcotic
Substances (Government Analysts) Rules,
2001 a complete mechanism is to be
adopted by.the Chemical Examiner upon
receipt of samples and a report is then to
be submitted by him referring to the
necessary protocols and mentioning the
tests applied and their results but in the

ur

ptt? ])

eE0
-10-

case in hand we note that no protocol

whatsoever" was mentioned in the report

submitted by the Chemical Examiner and

no test was. réferred to on. the basis of

which the. Chemical Examiner had

concluded that the samples sent to him for

examination contained charas””.
9. It is turning to be a common practice with the
Investigating Officers that they are lacking their interest to
collect the material evidence in the cases and even no heed is
paid to collect the daily diaries from the police stations
regarding the arrival and departure of all concerned with the
investigation of a particular case, as these are the documents
which can correctly explain the status of the witnesses, their
presence at the spot, the time they consume in reaching to the
spot and the names of police officials who accompany. If
these documents are brought on record, the Investigating
Officer will lose the courage to manipulate the cases in police
stations. In the present case, when the Investigating Officer
was questioned regarding the arrival and departure from the
police station to spot, he blatantly answered that he did not
place on record the daily diary in this respect. His this lack of

seriousness tells nothing but to stamp him as an interested

witness and his testimony cannot wholeheartedly be relied

upon. In case titled Pir Noroz Ali Shah Vs. The State (2019

P.Cr. LJ. 457 [Peshawar (Abbottabad Bench)], it was
D
held that: a e
: oy. HN AME Coe
in order to establish the movement of OR yet n
police officials through confidence pores om
inspiring evidence, the production of daily yen
-ll-

diary of the police Station showing the
departure, constitution of raiding team, its
members ard subsequent arrival, was a
material piéce’ of evidence in favour of
prosecution. Indeed the daily. diaries are
maintained under the erstwhile Police
Rules 1934, Under Rule 28.48 it is
mandatory -for every police official to
make entry of-his departure, arrival and
all proceedings conducted between the
intervening’. period of departure and
arrival. Non-production of the daily diary
has caused serious doubts in the
prosecution case regarding the mode and
manner of raid.

10. To say the least, these glaring discrepancies
should not have escaped notice of the learned trial Court
while convicting the appellant/accused and awarding him the
impugned sentences. Therefore, the impugned judgment as
well as conviction and sentences awarded to the
appellant/accused are not sustainable in the eye of law and
invites interference. Consequently, this appeal is accepted,
and the impugned judgment of the learned trial Court is set
aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charges while
extending him the benefit of doubt; and be set free, forthwith,
if not required to ‘be detained in connection with any other

criminal case.

11. While dilating upon the facts and merit. of
Criminal Appeal No. 114-B/2019, we noticed that the learned

<7
trial Court has not: dealt with the case by applying its judicid®®

mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and also the yen’ We ch

appellant did not assist the Court in that respect, so we deem
-12-

it appropriate to remand the case to the learned trial Court
who will provide an opportunity to the appellant to produce
the record in his possession on the basis of which he claims
ownership of the vehicle and the learned trial Court is
directed to appreciate the evidence so tendered and thereafter,
decide the fate of the vehicle in accordance with law.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed and the matter is remanded
back to the trial Court to do the needful within a period of one
month positively after receiving record and the office is
directed to transmit the record forthwith so as to be placed

before the trial Court as and when available.

12. Above ‘are detailed reasons of our short of even

date.
