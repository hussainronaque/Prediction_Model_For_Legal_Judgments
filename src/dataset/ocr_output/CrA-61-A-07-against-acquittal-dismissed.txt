ABDUL LATIF KHAN, J:- This appeal has been
preferred by State through Advocate General, KPK,
Peshawar against the judgment/order dated
15.02.2007, passed by learned Special Judge,
Haripur whereby he acquitted the
accused/respondent from the charges leveled against
him, in case FIR No.71 dated 26.01.2004 u/s 9-C
CNSA r/w 3/4 PEHO, P.S. Kot Najibullah, Haripur.

2. As per prosecution case, the complainant
Babar Khan ASI on receiving spy _ information
regarding selling of charas by the
accused/respondent, rushed to the spot

accompanied by other police officials where the
accused/respondent on seeing the police party,
starting decamping from the spot who was chased
and overpowered by the police party whereas two
persons sitting with the accused decamped from the
spot. On search of jacket of accused/respondents
eight Patay (slabs) Charas were recovered which on
weighing came out to be 2 Kg 35 grams. 5/5 grams
were separated from each slab and sealed into
parcel for chemical analysis while remaining quantity
was sealed into separate parcel. Consequently the
accused/respondent was arrested and a case vide
FIR mentioned above was registered against him.

3. After completion of investigation complete
challan against accused was submitted in the trial
Court where in order to prove its case against
accused, the prosecution examined 4 witnesses. At
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court acquitted
the accused/respondent vide impugned judgment
hence the instant Criminal appeal has been preferred
by State.

Arguments hear and record perused.
4. Perusal of record reveals that the

recovery of alleged Charas of 2 Kg 35 grams was
effected from possession of accused by PW.4 Babar
Khan ASI, who is Seizing Officer, complainant as well
as Investigation Officer in the instant case meaning
thereby that he is three in one. Under the law,
complainant and accused are two opponent parties.
In other words, they are two contesting parties. Role
of an Investigating Officer is of a neutral authority
whose object is to unearth the truth. The Investigating
Officer cannot be a part or a member of a party ina
case which he is _ investigating. In this regard,
guidance may be sought from Chapter 25 of
Investigation from Police Rules, 1934. Rule 25.2(3)
reads as under:---

"It is the duty of an
Investigating Officer to find out
the truth of the matter under
investigation. His object shall
be to discover the actual facts
of the case and to arrest the real
offender or offenders. He shall
not commit himself prematurely
to any view of the facts for or

against any person."

The language of Rule 25.2 above noted clearly

requires of an Investigating Officer not to commit
himself prematurely to any view of the facts for or
against any person. This cannot be expected from an
Investigating Officer who himself is a party. As a
matter of fact, concept of honest investigation is
based on non-partisanship and neutrality. The reason
and spirit of separating investigation wing from the
operation wing of police also emanates from the
same fact which reflects in Article 18 of the Police
Order, 2002, therefore, we feel that element of
honest, transparent and fair investigation lacks in the
instant case. The same point has been discussed by
the learned Sindh High Court reported in Nazir
Ahmad _v. The State PLD 2009 Kar. 191. The
Honourable Supreme Court has analyzed the above
point from another angle also. According to the
Honourable Supreme Court, Investigating Officer is
an important witness for the defence also and in case
he acts as a complainant and raiding officer, the
defence is deprived of his very precious right at the
same time and is forced not to depend upon the
same. The Federal Shariat Court also observed that

such an investigation is biased investigation. (Ashiq

alias Kaloo v. State 1989 PCr.LJ 601). In State v.
Bashir and others 1998 SC 408, the Honourable
Supreme Court observed that "as observed above,
Investigating Officer is as important witness for the
defence also and in case the head of the police party
also becomes the Investigating Officer, he may not
be able to discharge his duties as required of him
under the Police Rules".

5. Apart from above, despite receiving spy
information, PW.3 being an ASI did not bother to
inform his highups so that the proceedings could be
conducted in accordance with law as according to
Section 21 of CNSA, the officer below rank of Sub-
Inspector of Police, has no power of entry, search,
seizure and arrest without warrant. He was required
at least to inform an official having rank of Sub
Inspector of his Police Station but he straight away
went to the spot and also not conducted any test
purchase regarding allegation of selling narcotics by
the accused/respondents which creates doubt in the
prosecution case. Though two persons have been
shown to be sitting with the accused/respondent, who
decamped from the spot, while accused was over

powered but even then no recovery of sale amount of
contraband was recovered from possession of the
accused which could depicts that accused was
actually selling contraband especially when two
customers were present with him at the relevant time
nor any scale etc, was recovered from the appellant
which could strengthen the allegation of prosecution
regarding selling of narcotics by the
accused/respondent.

6. The type of charas has also not been
mentioned in the FIR as to whether the recovered
contraband were Charas Garda or Charas Pukhta
which makes the recovery doubtful. Besides, the
alleged recovery of contraband was effected on
26.1.2004 but the samples sent by the 1.0, were
received in the FSL on 7.2.2004, after delay of about
12/13 days which delay has not been explained by
the prosecution nor any statement of concerned
official in whose presence the contraband were lying
during those period, was recorded creating doubt in
the recovery of contraband.

7. Despite prior information about selling of
charas by the accused, no independent witness has

been associated by PW.3 which could support the
prosecution case. Though police officials are as good
as witnesses as other private person could be but
when the complainant, 1.0 are same and marginal
witnesses are also his subordinate/colleagues then
there is no chance of fair investigation especially
when the accused was already known to PW.3 as per
contents of FIR so there is every possibility of false
involvement of accused in the instant case wherein
the whole proceedings were conducted by one
person who being below the rank of SI, having no
power to seize, search and arrest the accused.

8. So far as registration of other FIRs
against the accused/respondent are concerned, the
prosecution failed to bring on record any history of
conviction of the accused in those cases so mere
registration of other FIRs against an accused cannot
be made a ground for his conviction. Besides, there
are material contradictions in the statements of
prosecution witnesses which have been discussed by
the learned trial Court in detail and repetition of the
same would be wastage of time, therefore, the
learned trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused

from the charges leveled against him through
impugned judgment, which needs no interference by
this Court.
In view of what has been discussed

above, this Criminal appeal being without force is

dismissed.

Announced.
