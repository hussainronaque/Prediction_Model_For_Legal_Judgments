SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J... Through present criminal appeal
preferred under section 410 Cr.P.C. appellant Noor Zaman has
impugned the judgment dated 29.11.2018, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, Lakki Marwat, in case F.I.R No. 485
dated 19.07.2014, under sections 302/34 P.P.C, registered at Police
Station, Naurang, District Lakki Marwat, whereby he has been
convicted under section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment
for life as Tazir, on two counts with compensation of Rs.30,00,000/-
(rupees thirty lacs) payable to the legal heirs of deceased Khalid Khan
and Yasmina Khalid, in terms of section 544-A, Cr.P.C. The
sentences awarded to the appellant were ordered to run concurrently.
Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to him.
2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the F.I.R (Ex:PA)

registered on the basis of murasila Ex:. PW-13/1, is that on 19.7.2014

-2-

at 08:10 a.m. complainant Yasmina Khalid, in injured condition, made
report in Emergency Room of Civil Hospital, Naurang, to the effect
that on the eventful day, she alongwith her husband Khalid Khan went
out of their house in order to meet their cousins, her husband was
following her at a distance of some paces, meanwhile, at about 07:12
hours, accused Noor Zaman son of Akbar Zaman, duly armed with
pistol, came there and started firing upon them with the intention to
commit their gatl-e-amd, resultantly, both of them were hit and fell
down; that her husband Khalid Khan succumbed to the injuries on the
spot. After the occurrence, the accused decamped from the spot.
Motive for the offence was stated to be a dispute over use of pathway.
3. The report of deceased, then injured Mst. Yasmina
Khalid was reduced into writing in shape of murasila (Ex: PW 13/1)
by Sahar Gul Assistant Sub Inspector (PW-13). He also prepared
injury sheets and inquest report of deceased Khalid Khan, Ex: PW
13/2 to Ex: PW 13/4, respectively and murasila was sent by him
through constable Bashir Khan No.189 for registration of case to the
police station while deceased Khalid Khan and deceased, then injured
Yasmina Khalid were sent to the doctor under the escort of constable
Hamidullah No.6507 alongwith the relevant documents.

4. It is pertinent to mention here that Mst. Yasmina Khalid
(widow of Khalid Khan), was referred to Civil Hospital Bannu, for
medical treatment, where she succumbed to her injuries on 27.7.2014,
hence, Section 324 P.P.C was deleted and section 302 P.P.C was
inserted. Her inquest report was prepared by PW-10, Naizam Khan

ASI, whereafter, her dead-body was sent under the escort of constable

-3-

Siraj-ud-din to the Civil Hospital, Naurang for postmortem
examination, as reflected from Daily Diary No. 24.

5. After completion of investigation by Mr. Sahib Khan SI
investigation (PW-13), complete challan was submitted before the
trial Court against the accused where he was charge-sheeted for the
offence to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to
substantiate the charge against the accused, prosecution examined as
many as thirteen witnesses, whereafter, statement of accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, where the accused professed his
innocence and false implication in the case, however, neither he
wished to be examined on oath in terms of section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor
opted to produce evidence in his defence. After hearing arguments,
the learned trial Court convicted the accused and sentenced him, as
mentioned above, hence, the instant appeal.

7. It is worth mentioning that as per report of the SHO
police station Naurang, the complainant Mst. Yasmina Khalid passed
away and her family members had shifted to unknown abode, as such,
her legal heirs could not be traced out. In such view of the matter, this
Court heard arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant and the
learned Additional Advocate General, at length, and perused the
record with their valuable assistance.

8. It was the bloodiest day, when both the unfortunate
husband and wife were done to death, without knowing their fault.
After receiving firearm injuries, the husband Khalid Khan died on the
spot, whereas the complainant Mst. Yasmina Khalid was rushed to the

hospital in serious condition, where she reported the matter to one

-4.

Sahar Gul ASI (PW-13), which led to a charge against the appellant.
The motive was stated to be a dispute over a thoroughfare; besides the
complainant, none else saw the incident. Though the appellant has
been convicted by the learned trial Court after appreciating the
evidence, but we have to scrutinize as to whether the learned trial
Court, while convicting the appellant, has applied its judicial mind to
the facts and circumstances of the case, it is yet to be seen as to
whether the complainant while making the report was oriented in time
and space and was capable to talk, as the only evidence against the
appellant is the dying declaration of the complainant, so need is there
to see as to whether it gets corroboration from the independent
sources or otherwise.

9. The injured was taken to the hospital by one Abdus
Samad Khan, who was the owner of the house where the unfortunate
husband and wife were residing. After arrival of the injured and dead-
body to the hospital, the scribe namely Sahar Gul Khan ASI (PW-13),
also attracted. After the report was made, he prepared the injury sheet
of the complainant and also the injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased. After the requisite formalities, the injured was sent to the
doctor under the escort of PW Hamidullah, for her medical
examination, who was examined by the doctor and her medico-legal
report was prepared.

10. The scribe was examined as PW-13, who stated that on
his arrival to the hospital it was 08:10 a.m. when the complainant
reported the matter and thereafter, he prepared the injury sheets and

inquest report, after the needful was done the injured was sent to the

-5-

doctor for her medical examination. The complainant was examined
by Dr. Azad Khan (PW-7), who stated that it was at 08:00 a.m. when
the injured Mst. Yasmina Khalid was produced before him for her
medical examination, he examined the injuries of the injured and
prepared her medico-legal report. He further stated that at the time of
examination, apart from him and his paramedical staff, none else was
present. In order to ascertain the time of arrival given by both the
doctor and the scribe, it is essential to read the statement of PW-8
Hamidullah FC, who accompanied the scribe to the hospital, he stated
that it was 08:20 a.m. that he alongwith PW-13, reached to the
hospital and the complainant reported the matter at 08:20 a.m. and at
the same time the injury sheets and inquest report were prepared and
under his escort the injured was shifted to the doctor for her medical
examination. All the three witnesses remained inconsistent with the
time of arrival of the complainant to the hospital and her medical
examination. We are surprised, if the doctor examined the lady at 8:00
a.m. the time when the report was not yet made, then how he endorsed
the injury sheet which was prepared at 08:20 a.m. and the report was
made at 08:10 a.m. Again, it is astonishing that the doctor did not
mention as to whether the complainant was fully conscious, capable to
talk and oriented in time and space, so much so, her blood pressure
and pulse rate was not recorded. The doctor was examined as PW-7,
who stated that at the time of her examination the complainant was in
critical condition. He further stated that besides other major organs of
the body, her lungs were injured and according to medical

jurisprudence, when the lungs get injured, it turns hard to breath. The

-6-

doctor went on to say that neither he issued a certificate regarding her
capability to talk nor he gave his opinion, so much so the doctor did

not endorse the murasila.

In case titled Khyber Khan Vs. Shahid Zaman and another
(2019 P.Cr.L.J. Peshawar 979), it was held that:-

“For believing a dying declaration, inter
alia, one of the essential ingredient is that
the prosecution shall establish through
cogent evidence that the dying man was in
full senses, conscious and alert to the
surroundings, was fully oriented in space
and time and was able to make a coherent
statement and the doctor present at the
occasion shail give a fitness certificate
about the condition of a dying man, but
such is not the case herein”.

11. The scribe was examined as PW-13, who stated that the
complainant reported the matter, whereafter, he prepared injury sheet.
We cannot ignore this aspect of the case that when the report was
made in the hospital and the doctor was available what prevented
PW-13 to request the doctor for a fitness certificate to ascertain as to
whether the injured was capable to talk or not. PW-13 did not take the
pains to call for the doctor so that the report of the complainant could
be taken in his presence and even after the report was made no
endorsement of the doctor was requested on the murasila. The
conduct of PW-13 is not above board and also that of the doctor who
examined the injured, as admittedly, the report was made at 08:10
a.m. and the injured alongwith injury sheet was produced to the
doctor, then how the doctor examined the injured at 08:00 a.m. and
how he endorsed the injury sheet when it was not yet prepared. The
cumulative effect of what is stated above, leads us nowhere but to

hold that the injured was brought to the hospital by the co-villagers

-7-

and the initial investigation was conducted prior to the report and it
was on arrival of some interested persons that the matter was shown
reported by the complainant and the appellant was charged.

12. Admittedly, the complainant alongwith her deceased
husband were residing in the house of one Abdus Samad, as the
deceased had migrated from Waziristan and Abdus Samad was the
first person who attracted to the spot soon after the incident and took
the then injured/complainant to the hospital in a Rickshaw. He was
examined as PW-7, who stated that while enroute to the hospital, the
injured did not talk to him, but this witness maintained calmness and
kept mum of what next happened in the hospital, however, he stated
that it was his brother Abdul Qayum, who told him that the lady
reported the matter in his presence, but what surprises us, is, that
neither the said Abdul Qayum was cited as a prosecution witness, nor
the Investigating Officer recorded his statement in this respect. Had
Abdul Qayum been present, he would have signed/verified the report
as a rider, but he did not.

13. The issue in hand to resolve is, as to whether the seat of
injuries could allow the injured to retain her senses, so much so, to
report the matter. The doctor categorically stated that the patient was
in a critical condition with her major organs injured including lungs.
The complainant being in critical condition was referred to Civil
Hospital, Bannu for further management and it was on the next day
ie. 27.7.2014, that the complainant breathed her last. Dr. Zeenat
Jamal conducted autopsy on the body of the deceased, where she

explained that most of the major organs of the body were

-8-

damaged/injured. She was examined as PW-9, the relevant portion of
her cross-examination is reproduced as: “According to my
examination with other organs the left lung, pericardium, heart and
main blood vessels were injured.”, While applying our judicial mind
to what the doctor stated we can form no other opinion but to hold

that the complainant was not capable to talk and was unable to report.

The apex Court in case titled “Tahir Khan Versus

the State” (2011 SCMR 646) held that--

"It is thus absolutely clear from the

principles laid-down by this court that dying

declaration is a weaker type of evidence

which needs corroboration and_ that

conviction can be based on the basis of such

a declaration when fully corroborated by the

other reliable evidence. Thus the facts and

circumstances of each case have to be kept in

view and also the credibility, reliability and

acceptability of such a declaration, by the

Court."
14. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and recovered
blood-stained earth alongwith four empties of 30 bore pistol and on
the pointation of Abdus Samad PW-S, the site-plan was prepared.
Though the recoveries were effected on 19.7.2014, but received to the
Forensic Sciences Laboratory on two different dates, the blood stained
earth alongwith garments of the deceased were received on 24.7.2014,
whereas the empties on 06.8.2014. The Investigating Officer was
examined on this particular aspect of the case, but he could not
explain that why the empties were received much later than the

garments and even he could not explain that where and in whose

custody these empties were lying. He expressed his inability to

confirm the same. It was the duty of Investigating Officer to record

-9-

the statement of the Moharrir of the concerned Police Station and to
place on record a copy from Register No.19, but neither the Moharrir
was examined to confirm the safe custody, nor an abstract from the
said register was collected and placed on the file. The Investigating
Officer did not take the pains to examine the person, who took these
empties to the Forensic Sciences Laboratory. When such is the state
of affairs, the FSL report in respect of the empties gains no ground
and it cannot be taken against the accused.

15. The motive was stated to be a dispute over the
thoroughfare, but admittedly the complainant and her husband were
not the residents of the village where the unfortunate incident
occurred, rather they had migrated from Waziristan and were
temporarily residing in the house, whereas the appellant is the
permanent resident of the village. The Investigating Officer did not
probe into the matter and he did not record the statement of any
independent witness to confirm the dispute, so much so, the owner of

the house who was examined as PW-S, did not utter a single word in

this regard. We know that prosecution is not bound to setup motive in
every case but once it is alleged and not proved, then ocular account is
required to be scrutinized with great caution. It has been held in the
case titled "Hakim Ali Vs. The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the
prosecution though not called upon to establish motive in every case,
yet once it has setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution

must suffer consequences and not the defence. The above view has

been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State" (PLD 1976
-10-

S.C. 629), wherein it has been observed by their lordships that,
“motive is an important constituent and if found by the Court to be
untrue, the Court should be on guard to accept the prosecution story”.
16. The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently
argued that the appellant remained absconder for sufficient long time,
but mere absconscion of accused is not conclusive proof of guilt of an
accused person; it is only a suspicious circumstance against an
accused that he was found guilty of the offence. However, suspicions
after all are suspicions, the same cannot take the place of proof, the
value of absconcion, therefore, depends on the facts of each case. In
case titled "Liagat Hussain and others Vs Falak Sher and others"
(2003 SCMR 611 (a), it has been held:-

"(a) Eye-witnesses including the

complainant had failed to furnish a

plausible and acceptable explanation

for being present on the scene of

occurrence and were chance

witnesses---Prosecution case did not

inspire confidence and fell for short

of sounding probable to a man of

reasonable prudence---Abscondence

of accused in such circumstances

could not offer any useful

corroboration to the case of
prosecution"

17. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available on
file, this Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against appellant.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by the learned trial Court is set-aside and he is

acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall

-ll-

be released forth with from jail, if not required to be detained in
connection with any other case.

18. Above are the reasons of our short order of the even

date.
