QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This criminal

appeal under Section 410 Cr.P.C by Syed
Zahir Hussain son of Syed Gul Shah Hussain
and Wajahat Ali son of Sabit Ali residents of
Bosi Tang Khadi Zai, District Kohat,
appellants, is directed against the
judgment/order dated 14.06.2017 of learned
Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court, Kohat,
whereby, the appellants were convicted
under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and sentenced to

imprisonment for three years R.| and fine of
Rs.100000/- or in default of payment of fine to
further four months S.I, while extending
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C to the
appellants.

2. According to FIR No.231 dated
17.08.2016 under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA
registered in Police Station KDA, Kohat,
Zardad Khan SHO along with constables
Waqas Jamal No.931, Inamullah No.79,
Excise & Taxation Officer Inspector Tariq
Afridi, S.| Israr Khan and other staff members
was present on checking duty at main road
near Habib Shah Hujra when, in the
meantime, white colour Suzuki No.3484/PR
came there. The driver of the Suzuki
disclosed his name as Wajahat son of Sabit
Ali resident of Bosi Tang, Khadi Zai, while the
person sitting on the front seat of the Suzuki
also disclosed his name as Syed Zahir
Hussain son of Syed Gul Shah Hussain
resident of Khadi Zai Mitta Khan Khel, Orakzai
Agency, and during checking of the Suzuki, a

plastic carton was found in the body of the
Suzuki under the seat on left side, wherefrom
five packets chars Garda, each packet
weighing 1200/1200 grams, total 6000 grams,
were recovered, and from each _ packet,
samples weighing 5/5 grams were separated
for analysis in the FSL and the remaining
5975 grams chars Garda was _ separately
sealed and taken into possession by the
complainant/SHO. The vehicle was also taken
into possession, and both the
accused/appellants were arrested. The
complainant/SHO drafted murasila, and sent
the same to the P.S, where case was
registered against both the
appellants/accused.

3. During investigation, the Investigating
Officer prepared the site plan, and also
dispatched the samples to the FSL for report
of the chemical examiner, and report there-
from was received in the affirmative. After
completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted in the case against the

accused/appellants to the learned trial Court.
4. The learned trial Court framed formal
charge under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA against the
accused/appellants, to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. In support of its
case the prosecution examined seven PWs,
including, Razi Gul SI (PW.1); Zardad Khan SI
(PW2); Tariq Khan Afridi Inspector Excise and
Taxation Office, Kohat (PW.3); Javed Iqbal
IHC (PW.4); Youaf Jamal FC No.83 (PW.5);
Ashfaq Khan SI (PW.6); and Muhammad Asif
LHC (PW.7). After prosecution closed its
evidence, statements of the accused were
recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. They
disputed allegations of the prosecution, but
declined to be examined on oath or produce
defence evidence. Following arguments on
behalf of both the sides, the learned trial
Court/Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court,
Kohat convicted both the accused/appellants
under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and awarded
sentences of imprisonment for three years
with fine of Rs.100000/- each or in default to

further four months S.l, vide impugned
judgment/order dated 14.06.2017; hence the
instant appeal by both the appellants.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellants and learned AAG heard; and
record perused.

6. The prosecution case, briefly stated, is
that chars Garda weighing 6000 grams in five
packets, each packet weighing 1200 grams,
was found and recovered in a plastic carton
underneath left seat of body of white Suzuki
No.3484/PR being driven by
appellant/accused Wajahat Ali and
appellant/accused Syed Zahir Hussain
occupying front seat of the vehicle.

7. It may be pointed out, at the very
outset, that the prosecution failed to prove
either ownership of the Suzuki or
appellant/accused Wajahat Ali its driver. On
the other hand, not only this fact has been
established on the record that the vehicle was
a passenger Suzuki but appellant/accused
Syed Zahir Hussain was also a Constable in

FC Hangu Platoon No.360, besides the fact
that nothing was available on the record to
suggest previous involvement of the
appellant/accused in such like cases.
Admittedly, the contraband was not recovered
from personal possession of either of the two
appellants/accused. Even the plastic carton,
where-from the five packets of chars Garda
were allegedly recovered was not taken into
possession; and, as such, not produced in the
Court.

8. There are also material contradictions
in the evidence adduced by the prosecution in
support of its case, as the complainant SHO
Zardad Khan (PW.2) stated that the murasila
was neither in his hand writing nor in the hand
writing of Tariq Inspector, rather the same was
written on his dictation by his Constable, but
he did not remember name of the said
Constable, and that similar was the case of
recovery memo EXPW2/1 and card of arrest.
The complainant SHO was, however, negated
not only by Tariq Khan Afridi Inspector Excise

& Taxation, Kohat (PW.3) but also by the 1.0,
Ashfaq Khan SI (PW.6), because the former
categorically stated that the murasila was
drafted by Zardad SHO, whereas the latter
was positive in recalling “that the recovery
memo, murasila and card of arrest were in
the hand writing of seizing officer having his
signatures”. The Investigating Officer (PW.6)
admitted in his statement before he Court
“that Tariq Khan Inspector called the SHO that
he had apprehended the person and on that
the SHO went there”, thus creating serious
doubt about version of the prosecution that it
was the complainant/SHO who apprehended
the appellants/accused and made the alleged
recovery of narcotics from the Suzuki of the
appellants/accused.

9. The alleged recovery was shown that
of chars Garda, but the report of chemical
examiner showed physical appearance as
‘brown solid’, and the complainant Inspector
(PW2) and the marginal witness Tariq Khan
Afridi, Inspector Excise and Taxation Kohat

(PW.3) ‘accordingly’ ‘adjusted’ their
statements by showing the recovered chars in
the shape of slabs and half backed chars
Garda, contrary to the description of
recovered chars shown in the FIR only as
chars Garda which is, admittedly in soft form
as against chars Pukhta which is in baked
shape.

10. Apart from non production, rather non-
existence, of daily diary of the P.S showing
departure and arrival of the complainant SHO,
the complainant/SHO did not remember as to
how he separated samples from each packet.
Besides, the 1.0 (PW.6) admitted this fact that
the samples were lying with him for two days,
and were sent to the FSL on third day of the
alleged recovery i.e. on 19.08.2016, without
any proof with regard to safe custody of the
samples in these three days. The retaining of
samples by the |.O for three days without any
reason, let alone justifiable reason, would
certainly cast shadow of doubt on the

opinion/report of the chemical examiner and
also on recovery of narcotics from the
appellant/accused.

11. In view of the above — stated
discrepancies/contradictions in the case of
prosecution, there was hardly any material
before the learned trial Court to award the
sentence of rigorous imprisonment for three
years and fine of Rs.100000/- each to the
appellants/accused. Therefore, the appeal is
accepted, and while setting aside the
impugned judgment along with conviction and
sentences awarded to the appellants, they are
acquitted of the charges levelled against them
by the prosecution; and be set free, forthwith,
if not required in any other case.

Announced.
