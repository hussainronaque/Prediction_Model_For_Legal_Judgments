Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended the convict-appellant. It was also ordered

that all the sentences shall run concurrently.

2. Through the instant appeal, the convict has
questioned his conviction and sentences, whereas
complainant party has filed connected Criminal
Revision No.60-P/2021, seeking enhancement of
sentence of the convict from life imprisonment to
penalty of death on two counts, as provided for the
offence under section 302 PPC.

3. Since both the matters are emanating from one

and the same judgment of the learned trial court,
3

therefore, we propose to decide the same through this
single judgment.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in the FIR
Ex.PA are that on 06.6.2011, Shaukat Saleem SHO of
P.S, Shakardara received information that two dead
bodies and one injured had been brought to the Civil
Hospital, Shakardara from village Janak. Upon the
information, he rushed to emergency room of Civil
Hospital where the dead bodies of deceased Nazar Gul
and Mst.Mumtaz Begum along with one injured Attq-
ur-Rehman were lying there. Complainant/injured
Saidan Gul reported the matter to the police to the
effect that on the day of occurrence he along with his
deceased brother Nazar Gul were present on the
thoroughfare near the house of Zar Janan, meanwhile,
accused Amal Khan and Rab Nawaz sons of Shehbaz
Khan and Mushtaq s/o Resham Khan duly armed with
firearms came there and started firing upon them with
the intention to commit their Qatl-e-Amd. Due to the
firing of Amal Khan, his brother Nazar Gul got hit and
died on the spot whereas the complainant escaped
unhurt. That accused Mushtaq and Rab Nawaz also
started firing at Ateeq-ur-Rehman and Mst.Mumtaz
Begum, who were present in the house of Zar Janan
with the intention to commit their Qatl-e-Amd,

resultantly from the firing of accused Mushtaq, Mst.
Mumtaz Begum got hit and died on the spot while
from the firing of accused Rab Nawaz, Ateeq-ur-
Rehman sustained firearm injuries. After commission
of offence the accused decamped from the spot.
Motive behind the occurrence was stated to be blood
feud.

5. After completion of investigation, initially
challan w/s 512 Cr.P.C was submitted against all the
accused and they were declared proclaimed offenders.
Later on co-accused Amal Khan was arrested, who
faced trial and vide judgment dated 11.03.2015 he was
acquitted. Appeal was filed against his acquittal but the
same was abated for reason that he was murdered
during that period. More-so, he was acquitted through
separate trial and the appeal was not heard on merit,
therefore, that acquittal will not have any bearing on
the fate of the present case. In this regard reliance is
placed on the judgment of this Court rendered in

“HAYATULLAH V. ALI ABBAS and another” (2018

YLR Note 43) wherein it is held that;

“Before dilating upon the merits of the present
case first we would like to discuss, the main
grounds of prosecution case, that evidence against
co-accused namely Saifullah was believed and his
Cr.A. No.50/2010 was dismissed, vide judgment
dated 01.06.2011, by this court and leave to appeal
was also refused in Jail petition No.48 of 2012 by
the apex Court vide order dated 18.12.2012. Law
has provided holding independent trial to each
accused, whenever he is arrested. Court is under
obligation to assess the evidence led by the
prosecution independently, without being
influenced from acquittal or conviction of co-
accused, whose trial was conducted earlier.
Rationale behind holding of fresh trial would be a
futile exercise, if courts subscribe to the result of
trial conducted earlier. Our view is fortified by
seeking guidance from the judgment rendered by
this court in case of "Zalav Mir v. The State"
(1997 PCr.LJ 510) and "Sher Akbar v. Mst. Sajida
and another" (2011 YLR 1014), wherein this
Court has dealt almost similar situation and has
rendered judgments different to those earlier

discussed”

6. After arrest of accused/appellant Rab Nawaz and
completion of investigation, supplementary challan
was submitted against him before the learned trial
court; where he was tried and ultimately convicted and
sentenced by the learned trial Court vide impugned
judgment as mentioned in the preceding paragraph.

7. Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused.

8. The complainant Saidan Gul (PW-8) had
charged accused/appellant Rab Nawaz and Mushtaq
alongwith co-accused Amal Khan (acquitted) for the
murder of his brother Nazar Gul, Mst. Mumtaz
Begum, injuries sustained by Atteq-ur-Rehman and for
ineffective firing upon him. Admittedly the occurrence
had taken place at 17:00 hours while the report was

lodged at 20:00 hours with a delay of 03 hours.
According to the murasila and site plan the occurrence
had taken place near the house of Zar Janan at
thoroughfare of Village Janak. Shaukat Saleem Ex-
Inspector appeared before the Court as PW-2, who
scribed the report of the complainant. PW-2 in his
cross examination stated that the distance between the
place of occurrence and hospital is about 35/36
kilometers. In the present occurrence two persons
namely Nazar Gul and Mst. Mumtaz Gegum have lost
their lives while Attiq-ur-Rehman was injured, it
would have been spent considerable time in making
preparations for shifting the deceased and injured to
the hospital. By considering the facts of the present
case in our view the delay would be immaterial and is |
of no benefit to the appellant. Dr. Arshad Sohail
appeared before the Court and recorded his statement
as PW-10. According to the statement of PW-10, he
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased
Nazar Gul at 20:00 hours while probable time between
death and post mortem is mentioned as 03 hours which
corresponds with the time of occurrence as stated in
the FIR i.e. 17:00 hours. Similarly, autopsy of Mst.
Mumtaz Begum was conducted at 11:00 PM and the
time between death and post mortem is mentioned as

within 06 hours which also confirms the time of
occurrence as mentioned in the report of the
complainant.

9. Complainant Saidan Gul was examined as (PW-
8), who reiterated the same narration as mentioned in
the report. Ateeq-ur-Rehman, injured/eyewitness was
examined as (PW-9), who supported the version of the
complainant and his presence on the spot at the time of
occurrence. They were subjected to thorough and
intense cross examination, but no _ material
contradictions came to surface to cast doubt on the
prosecution version. Nothing favorable to the
appellant/accused was brought on the record and there

is no reason for false implication has been suggested.

The presence of the complainant and
injured/eyewitness along with the deceased has been
proved and they can be well regarded as reliable
witnesses and even their evidence by itself alone is
sufficient without any independent corroboration.
Medical Officers were examined as PW-10 & PW-12
who have given the details of injuries caused to the
deceased as well to the injured. The medical evidence
fully supports the version of complainant.

10. So far as the recoveries in the case are
concerned, Wali Sher Khan, Inspector/Investigation
Officer (PW-4) has secured blood stained pebbles

(Ex.P-1) from the place of deceased Nazar Gul and 05
empties of 7.62 bore (Ex.P-2) from the places of
accused, recovered blood stained earth EX.P-3 from
the place of deceased Mst. Mumtaz Begum and injured
Ateeq-ur-Rehman (Ex.P-4), and 12 empties of 7.62
bore Ex.P-5 lying in scattered position from near the
place of accused Mushtaq and Rab Nawaz. PW-4 has
sent the blood stained articles and recovered empties to
the FSL and received the FSL report Ex.PA and
Ex.PZ/1. According to the FSL report the crime
empties were found to be fired from different weapons
which further strengthen the prosecution case. The
above recoveries shown in the site plan fully supports |

the ocular account.

11. Moving on to the motive of the prosecution in
the case regarding the involvement of the appellant in
the commissions of the offence. As per record, the
complainant Saidan Gul (PW-8) in his report in the
shape of murasila has stated motive behind the
occurrence as blood feud between the parties and
thereby accused committed the offence. Therefore,
stance of prosecution with regard to motive has been
fully proved by the prosecution. Moreover, the learned
trial Court has also given proper ground for lesser
sentence. In view of above, the prosecution has proved
the guilt of the appellant through cogent and

confidence inspiring ocular/direct evidence.
12. The core question for determination before this
Court is that when the appellant was charged by the
complainant for firing at injured Ateeq-ur-Rehman
(PW-9) only, the dead/acquitted co-accused Amal
Khan and absconding co-accused Mushtaq were
assigned the role of firing at the deceased Nazar Gul
and Mst. Mumtaz Begum respectively. The learned
trial Court had convicted the appellant under all the
heads by holding that he has shared common intention
and is liable for the death of both the deceased while
firing at them was not attributed to the appellant. It is a
matter of record that the occurrence had taken place in
a thoroughfare in front of the house of one Zar Janan
which is neither the place of residence of the
complainant party nor that of the accused. It appears
that the parties had confronted each other per chance at
the relevant time and thereafter the tragedy occurred.
Whether in such like circumstances the prosecution
has been able to prove the community of common
intention of the appellant with the co-accused named —
above. More-so, the owner of the house Zar Janan who
was relative of the complainant was abandoned by the
prosecution. In addition to that, it is also in the
evidence that the house of the complainant party is
visible and they can see each other from their

respective houses. Had this been a preplanned murder
10

then the accused could have done it in some other
place and time. In this regard reliance is placed on the
judgment of case titled “PANDURANG, TUKIA AND

BHILLIA vy. The STATE OF HYDERABAD” {PLD

1956 Supreme Court (India) 176} wherein it is held

that;

“Now in the case of section 34 we think it is well
established that a common intention presupposes
prior concert. It requires a pre-arranged plan
because before a man can be vicariously convicted
for the criminal act of another, the act must have
been done in furtherance of the common intention
of them all. Mahbub Shah v. King-Emperor ().
Accordingly there must have been a prior meeting

of minds. Several persons can simultaneously
attack _a_man_and_each_can_have_the same

attack_a_man_and_each can have {he same
intention, namely the intention to kill, and each
can individually inflict a separate fatal blow and
yet_none would_have_the common intention
required by the section because there was no prior

meeting of minds to form a pre-arranged plan. In
a case like that, each would be individually liable

for whatever injury he caused but none could be
vicariously convicted for the act of any of the
others; and if the prosecution cannot prove that
his separate blow was a fatal one he cannot be
convicted of the murder however clearly an
intention to kill could be proved in his case:
Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. King-Emperor (1) and
Mahbub Shah vy. King Emperor (supra). As their
Lordships say in the latter case, “the partition
which divides their bounds is often very thin:
nevertheless, the distinction is real and
substantial, and if overlooked will result in
miscarriage of justice.”

(Emphasis provided)
11

13. Moreover, care must be taken not to confuse
same or similar intention with common intention; the
partition which divides their bounds is often very thin;
nevertheless, the distinction is real and substantial, and
if overlooked will result in miscarriage of justice. In
their Lordship’s view, the inference of common
intention within the meaning of the term in Section 34
should never be reached unless it is a necessary
inference deducible from the circumstances of the
case. It must be shown that the criminal act was done
by one of the accused persons in furtherance of the
common intention of all. ‘Common intention’ within
the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan,
and to convict the accused of an offence applying the
section it should be proved that the criminal act was
done in concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan.
Therefore, the findings of the learned trial Court by
holding the accused vicariously liable for the act of his
co-accused i.e. for the murder of Nazar Gul and Mst.
Mumtaz Begum is not inconsonance with the provision
of section 34 Cr.P.C, hence we hold that the evidence
to that extent has not been properly appreciated by the
learned trial Court.

14. In view of above, the accused is held liable for
the injury caused by him to injured Ateeq-ur-Rehman

(PW-9), therefore, his conviction and sentence under
12

section 324/337-D/334 PPC r/w section 337-T PPC is
maintained while he is acquitted of the charges of gatl-
il-amd of deceased Nazar Gul and Mst. Mumtaz
Begum. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is extended to
the convict-appellant. All the substantive sentences

shall run concurrently.

15. So far as the revision petition No.60-P/2021 is
concerned, the conviction and sentence of the appellant
awarded by the learned trial Court is maintained by
this Court to the extent of section 324/337-D/334 PPC
r/w section 337-T PPC for the injuries caused to
injured Ateeq-ur-Rehman while he has been’ acquitted
of the charges of qatl-il-amd of deceased Nazar Gul
and Mst. Mumtaz Begum, therefore, the revision
petition for enhancement of the sentence has become

infructuous and the same is dismissed.
