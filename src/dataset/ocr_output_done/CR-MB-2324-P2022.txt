MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALI, J.- The petitioner

through the instant petition seeks his release on bail in
case FIR No.776 dated 16.7.2022, under Sections 5 of
Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (VI of 1908), registered
at police station Faqir Abad, Peshawar, as he has been
declined relief of bail by the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XI, Peshawar, vide order dated
21.7.2022.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
First Information Report (F.LR), registered on the basis
of murasila, in brief, is that on 16.7.2022 at 21:00 hours,
Inspector Ijaz Khan SHO of police station Faqir Abad
received a spy information during patrol duty that
grenades were lying in shoe factory of the
accused/petitioner situated at Saidy Road near Toray

Kababi, whereupon he alongwith other police Nafri
bt

rushed to the spot, where he found the petitioner in front
of his office. On checking the office, two hand-grenades
in a shopper were recovered therefrom, which were
secured by taking out safety pin and were sealed in a
parcel. Accused was arrested. Hence, the FIR.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued
that the alleged recovery has not been effected from
personal possession of the accused/petitioner. He further
submitted that according to clause a(iv) of Section 3 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms, 2013, the alleged
recovery comes within the purview of unlicenced
ammunition which is punishable under Section 15(e) of
the ibid Act to seven years imprisonment or fine or with
both. He further argued that punishment for the offence
under section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908,
is fourteen years, however, under section 8 of the ibid
Act, the prosecution is duty bound to receive sanction
from the Government. The learned counsel concluded
that in view of Section 71 PPC, if the offence falls
within two different pores in that eventuality, lesser
punishment would be considered. He prayed for release

of the petitioner on bail.

On the contrary, the learned Asstt: A.G.

vehemently argued that the recovery has been effected
from rented office of the petitioner and material
available on file fully connects him with the commission
of offence falling within prohibitory clause of Section
497, Cr.P.C., therefore, he is not entitled to the
concession of bail.

4. Arguments heard and record scanned.

5. Before proceeding further, it would be
appropriate to resolve the controversy as to whether
Section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act is applicable
keeping. in view the attending circumstances of the
present case and as to whether the offence would be
covered by clause (a)(iv) of Section 3 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013. The relevant sections of
law are reproduced below for ready reference:-

“Section 15(e), has in his possession

or under his control any arms or

ammunition in contravention of the

provisions of section 9.”

The definition of ammunition as provided
in clause (a)(iv) of Section 3 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, includes all types of
grenades. It reads as under:-

“(a)(iv): all types of grenades, bombs,

rockets, mines and fuels for flame
throwers.”

Section 5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Explosive

Substances Act, 2013, the Act that repealed the
-4-

erstwhile Explosive Substances Act, 1908, is
reproduced for convenience, which reads as follows:-

“5, Punishment for making or
possessing explosives under
suspicious circumstances.

“Any person who makes or knowingly
has in his possession or under his
control any explosive substance, under
such circumstances as to give rise to a
reasonable suspicion that he is not
making it or does not have it in his
possession or under his control for a
lawful object, shall, unless he can
show that he made it or had it in his
possession or under his control for a
lawful object, be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may
extend to fourteen years”.

It would not be out of place rather more
convenient to discuss the provision of Section 71 PPC,
which reads as under:-

“71. Limit of punishment of offence
made up of several offences:

Where anything which is an offence
is made up of parts, any of which
parts is itself an offence, the offender
shall not be punished with the
punishment of more than one of such
his offences, unless it be so expressly
provided;

Where anything is an offence falling
within two or more _ separate
definitions of any law in force for the
time being by which offences are
defined or punished, or

Where several acts, of which one of
more than one would by itself ‘or
themselves constitute’ an offence,
constitute, when combined, a
different offence;

The offender shall not be punished
with a more severe punishment than
the Court which tries him could
award for any one of such offences.”
-5-

6. Conjoint reading of the above sections of
law would reveal that Section 15(e) of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 is only applicable to a
case where possession or control of any arms or
ammunition is made in contravention of the provision of
Section-9, which puts an embargo of having possession
or control of arms without getting a proper licence.
Similarly, clause a(iv) of subsection (3) of the ibid Act
defines ammunition to include grenades and other things
and the punishment for an offence has been provided
under section 15, wherein if an accused person is found
in possession of a grenade then he shall be punished
with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or
fine which may extend to Rs.2,00,000/- or with both.
Taking the above-stated narration in juxtaposition with
Section-5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Explosive
Substances Act, 2013, the punishment so provided by
this section is imprisonment for a term which may
extend to fourteen years. The cross-road thereof, for
applicability of two Statutes, enforced in the field, that
carries different punishments for the similarly defined
offence, has been dealt with by section-71 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, which provides that if an offence is
falling within two or separate definitions of any law
enforced for the time being by which offences

are defined or punished, then, the offender shall not
-6-

be punished with more scvere punishment rather he
would be dealt with under the Statute that provides
lesser punishment. Thus, by using the term “shall” it
has been made abundantly clear that the provision is
mandatory and not directory in nature.

7. Now applying the above yardstick to the
facts and circumstances of the case, and keeping in mind
the provisions of Section 71 PPC, there is possibility that
the petitioner, even if found guilty of the offence, would
be extended benefit of section 71 PPC and at the most he
could be charged under section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, in view of explicit provisions
contained in Section 71 PPC, and the maximum
punishment provided under section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, is seven years or with
fine or with both, which is not hit by the restrictive
clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. Moreover, admittedly the
alleged recovery of hand grenades was neither effected
from personal possession of the petitioner nor at his
pointation, rather the same was allegedly effected from
his office. In such view of the matter, the petitioner is
entitled to the concession of bail.

8. For what has been discussed above, this
petition for post arrest bail is allowed and the
accused/petitioner is directed to be released on bail

subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of
Bae

Rs:100,000/- (one lac) with two sureties, each in the like

amount, to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty

Judicial Magistrate.

9. Above are the detailed reasons of my short

order of even date.
