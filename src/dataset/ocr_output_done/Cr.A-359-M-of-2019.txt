who had succumbed to her injuries later on. She
has stated in her report that she had been living
along with her husband at Lahore. They had come
to the house of one Imran, so as to facilitate
construction of their personal house in the locality,
and had been staying there as guests. She was
present along with her husband and Imran at his
house when her father Khaista Muhammad
(appellant herein) came along with his son namely
Sardar at 01:00 P.M on the day of occurrence. Her

St.

‘brother Sardar stood at the door while her father

Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

sy
entered the house, took out his pistol and made
firing at the complainant, as a result of which she
~ received injuries on both of her thighs. It was also
stated that her father and brother had been
extending life threats to them. The occurrence
was stated to have been witnessed by Naeemullah
husband of the lady as well as one Imran.

3. During the course of investigation,
the Investigating Officer recovered blood soaked
earth through cotton, blood stained shoes of the
complainant and three spent bullets of 30 bore
pistol from the spot vide recovery memo Ex. PW-
1/1 dated 11.01.2017, He had also recovered a 30

the purpose of comparison, report (Ex.PW-12/21)
received therefrom was in affirmative.

4. On completion of investigation in the
case, complete challan was put in Court against the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
>

present appellant while proceedings under section
512 .Cr.P.C were initiated against co-accused
namely Sardar Ali. Charge was framed against
appellant on 11.05.2017, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution was invited to
produce evidence, who accordingly examined
twelve (12) witnesses and closed its evidence.
Statement of the accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C. On conclusion of proceedings
in trial, accused/appellant was convicted for

commission of the offence vide judgment dated

30.07.2019 of the Court of learned Additional

ae

Sessions Judge-III Swat, as stated earlier.
Accused/appellant challenged his
conviction and sentence through the instant
appeal before this Court.
5. Learned counsel for appellant
submitted during the course of his arguments that
the two eyewitnesses named by complainant iti.
her report had not seen the occurrence which was
evident from statement of Naeemullah when he
appeared in the Court as PW-9, while the other
witness namely Imran had been abandoned by

the prosecution. He asserted that best evidence

NAWAB (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiaq Ibrahim ‘ts
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
had been withheld by the prosecution, while other
witnesses, who had not been shown in the FIR to
have seen the occurrence, had been posed ‘as
eyewitnesses of the occurrence, whose testimony
had not been believable. Regarding confessional
statement of the appellant, he stated that it had
not been true in its contents as same had not been
going in consonance with evidence of the
prosecution. He also added that confessional
statement recorded after 3 days of the arrest of
accused could not be relied upon. Regarding
recovery of pistol on pointation of the appellant
and its matching FSL report, the learned counsel
contended that the person from whose shop such
recovery had been effected had disowned the
same while appearing in Court as PW-4. In order
to bolster his submissions, he placed reliance
upon the judgments reported as 2016 SCMR 274,
2017 SCMR 898, 2019 SCMR 129, 2019 SCMR
274, 1999 P Cr.LJ 1087, 2011 PCr. LJ 470,
PLD 2012 Peshawar 22, 2018 YLR 1629, 2019
YLR 516 and 2019 P CrLJ 1014. |

6. The complainant-party (legal heirs
of the deceased) did not opt to engage their

NAWAB {D.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
private counsel and they stated that they would
rely upon arguments of the learned Astt:A.G.
Learned Astt: A.G appearing on behalf of State
submitted in his arguments that the deceased had
named her real father and brother for commission
of the offence, in her dying declaration. He added
that no malafide or any reason for false
implication of the appellant could be brought
forth by the defence during the course of trial.
The learned Astt: A.G laid particular stress on the
statement of daughter of the deceased lady -
namely Mst. Safeera recorded as PW-2, and
stated that she had been a natural witness who
had stood consistent throughout her statement
and no reason existed for disbelieving her
testimony. In the end, he stated that prosecution
had been able to prove its case against the
appellant beyond a shadow of doubt. |

7. We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for appellant, learned Astt: A.G
appearing on behalf of State and perused the
record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that
prosecution have been relying upon ‘Murasila’

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq tbrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Ex. PW-8/2 registered on the report of
complainant as dying declaration along with
certificate of the doctor issued regarding
consciousness of the lady at the relevant time
(Ex. PW-10/1), statements of the eyewitnesses
ie. Mst. Safeera recorded as PW-2 and Mst. Izat
Begum recorded as PW-3 as well as confessional
statement of the appellant Ex.PW-11/2.
9. In her dying declaration, the
In
lady/complainant has named her real father and
brother for causing her the injuries. The
certificate showing that the lady had been
conscious and capable of giving her statement
has also been obtained from the lady ‘doctor
namely Saima Rehman which was exhibited in
evidence as Ex. PW-10/1. The doctor has beer!
examined in support thereof as PW-10. She has
been cross-examined by the defence side but
nowhere has they disputed the fact that the lady
had been conscious and able to give her
statement to the police officer. Learned counsel
for appellant was also questioned in this respect,

ui
who referred to a sentence in the cross-examination

NAWAB (D.8) Hon’dle Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigqar Ahmad
of the lady doctor PW-10 wherein she has stated

as follows;

- pair St (foF 1-<restless wh Agitates _

The learned counsel had been trying
to interpret the word “restless” as “out of
senses”, but we are afraid we would not be able
to agree with him in this respect. The state of
being restless has been explained in the following
sentence that she had been suffering from pain. It
was obvious that she had received firearm
injuries and she would definitely have been in
pain, but it is important to note that she had
received all the injuries below her navel. Her
organs which were significant for enabling her to
speak had all been intact and no injury had bell
received thereupon. The doctor who had
examined the complainant has given her

certificate that the lady had been conscious and in

senses at the time of recording of her statement,

and she has stood by such a certificate during the
course of her examination before the Court. No
“Ge

reason existed to disbelieve her statement in this

respect. Learned counsel for appellant has also

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq (brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
argued at the bar that Mst. Safeera while
recording her statement as PW-2 had stated that
when the lady had received fire shots she had
become unconscious, but such unconsciousness
might have been due to the initial shock that she
had received. She had been examined in hospital
at 02:40 P.M ie. after 100 minutes of the
occurrence. This is not unnatural that initially a
person loses consciousness because of the fear
and shock of the initial impact of firing, however
subsequently regains it. Besides, her injuries were
of such nature that it may not have led to
immediate unconsciousness and the doctor has
expressly stated that she had been conscious at
the time of her examination in hospital, therefore
the statement of a child witness namely Mst.
Safeera may not be taken as a circumstance to
disbelieve statement of the doctor in this respect.
Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order
has made dying declaration as admissible in
evidence and same can therefore be safely relied
upon. While relying upon a dying declaration and
maintaining conviction Hon’ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan, in the case of “Farmanullah v/s

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

Qadeem Khan and another” reported as 2001

SCMR 1474 had observed;

“The dying declaration got recorded by Saida Mir
Khan, A.S.I. (P W.7) has been examined in the
light of the criterion as mentioned herein above
and we are of the opinion that it has been proved
beyond shadow of doubt and being a substantive
piece of evidence it could have been relied upon.
It is an admitted feature of the case that the
incident occurred in a broad daylight and only
one accused was nominated by assigning specific
rule leaving no question of mistaken identity, We
don't find any lawful justification whatsoever to
disbelieve Saida Mir Khan, A.S.1. (P.W.7) who
has no enmity or ill-will —_ against
convict/respondent. It may not be out of place to
mention here that once the dying declaration is
believed there is no legal requirement that it must
be supported by independent corroboration
specifically in cases where there is no allegation

_ Of the substitution of real culprit with that of
accused. In this regard we are fortified by the
dictum laid down in Niamat Ali v. The State 1981
SCMR 61. A careful analysis of the dying
declaration would reveal that the fateful incident
has been narrated in a simple and straightforward
manner by the injured who was not sure at the
moment when it was being recorded that he would
remain alive and more so, it finds full
corroboration from medical evidence,
surrounding circumstances and confidence
inspiring eye account furnished by Farmanullah
(P.W.5) and Muhammad Nabi (P.W.6). As
mentioned hereinabove no corroboration is
required and as a matter of caution the eye
account, motive -and medical evidence are
sufficient to lend corroboration to the dying
declaration. In this I regard reference can be
made to Hazara v. The State 1976 PCr.LJ 106. It
is well-entrenched legal position that "sanctity is
attached to dying declaration by the statute and it
is to be respected unless clear circumstances are
brought out showing it not to be reliable.

Further reliance in this respect may

be placed on judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in

NAWAB *- (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq [brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-ll-

the case of “Mehtab Khan v/s The State”
reported as “1996 SCMR 1137”.

10. The eyewitness account produced
‘by prosecution included PW-2 namely Mst.
Safeera and Mst. Izat Begum PW-3. Mst.Safeera
has been daughter of the deceased lady having an
age of 13 years at the time of recording of her
statement in Court. At such tender age she was
supposed to have been along with her mother
inside the house. She had been a natural
eyewitness of the occurrence. This fact may also
be discerned from the way this witness had stood
consistent during the course of her examination
in Court. The other eyewitness namely Mst. Izat
Begum had also been a natural eyewitness in the
sense that the occurrence had taken place inside
her house. Being a lady and housewife, her
presence inside her house had been very much
natural. This witness has also stood firm during
the course of her cross-examination and
statements of both these witnesses i.e. PW-2 and
PW-3 had been consistent inter-se as well, on
' material particulars of the case. Learned counsel
for appellant has mainly been asserting that when

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtieq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

cece oe oe
-12-

an eyewitness has not been shown to have seen
the occurrence, her statement could not be
believed. In certain cases, such a fact that a
witness had not been shown to have witnessed
the occurrence while lodging first report of the
occurrence, may be taken as sufficient to
disbelieve statement of such an eyewitness, but a
rule of thumb cannot be laid down in this respect.
Statement of an eyewitness has to be seen and
determined in peculiar circumstances of the
respective cases. Here it is important that the
occurrence had taken place inside the house. One
of the eyewitnesses had been a minor daughter of
the deceased lady while the other woman had
been the lady hosting the deceased, In the given
circumstances, their presence at the scene of
occurrence had been very much natural and
confidence inspiring. The fact that the lady,
while recording her dying declaration could not
name them as eyewitnesses may not be taken as a
reason for excluding their testimonies. In the case

of “Yousaf v/s_The State” reported as “NLR

1982 Criminal 31”, a Division Bench of the

NAWAB {0.8) Hon’bie Mr. Justice Ishtlaq brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Anmad
-13-

Hon’ble Sindh High Court had observed in a
somewhat situation;

“Now the question arises whether eye-witness
should be believed. It is true that except P.W.
Mohabbat all other witnesses are related to each
other. It may also be noted that accused Rasool
Bux who was acquitted was also related to Mohd.
Laiq as his son-in-law and the appellant is the
step son of Mohd. Laig. It sounds strange that
such close relations will be implicated falsely
without any genuine cause or grievance. The.
learned counsel for the appellant has disputed
that as the name of Laiq and Mst. Sughar does
not appear in the F.LR. the entire story should be
disbelieved, It is true that there is an omission in
incorporating these two names in the F.LR. but
this fact by itself is not sufficient to discredit the
evidence of the other persons particularly in the
circumstances of the case when the entire incident
has happened at the house of Mohd. Laig where
all of them were present. It will be rather unusual
that all these persons would come and stay and
some of them may have lunch at the house of
Laiq if he himself or his daughter were not
present there. The presence of Laig .ad Mst.,
Sughar in the light of the evidence brought on
record cannot be challenged.”

Further reliance in this respect may
also be placed on judgment of Hon’ble Sindh
High Court in the case of “Waheed alias Siraj v/s

The_ State” reported as PLJ 1990 Cr.C.

(Karachi) 379.

11. Confessional statement of th
accused/appellant had been recorded on qs day
of his arrest. The learned counsel for appellant
has though stated that such a confession could not

be believed once it had been recorded after three

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

Xs
-14-

days of his arrest, and in this respect he has
placed reliance upon judgments reported 2018
YER 1629 and 2019 P Cr.LJ 1014, but we find
confession in the case in hand to have been
voluntarily recorded. It is not a rule of law that
delayed confession, must be discarded in all
circumstances. Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan had believed confessional statement
recorded after 12 days of custody of an accused,
in the case of “Majeed v/s The State” reported as
2010 SCMR_55, wherein the Hon’ble Court had
observed;
“No doubt there was delay of 12 days in recording
the confession but this by itself its not sufficient to
discard the same. This Court in the case of Nabi
Bakhsh v. State 1999 SCMR 1972 held that delay
_ in recording the confessional statement by itself is
not sufficient to affect its validity. However, no
hard and fast rule can certainly be laid down
about the period within which the confessional
statement of the accused ought to be recorded

during investigation. Reference is also invited to
Muhammad Yaqoob v. State 1992 SCMR 1983.”

This Court in a recent judgment in
the case of “Jumaraz ws The State” (J.Cr. A.
No. _96-M_of 2018) had also believed a
confessional statement recorded after four days of
arrest of the accused by observing as follows;

“Although the confession was recorded with delay
because the appellant was arrested on 21.06.2017

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahtm
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-15-

and his confession was recorded on 25.06.2017,
however, the mentioned delay would not damage
the reliability of the confession in view of its
confidence inspiring nature and its full
corroboration by circumstantial evidence on the
record. Confession of an accused and its different
aspects in each case is to be looked into in light of
its attending facts and circumstances, therefore, it
is not a rule of universal application that in each
and every case the delay will essentially damage
the evidentiary value of confession.”

The confessional statement has not
only been true and voluntary in nature but has
also been supported by sufficient corroboratory
evidence in the shape of statements of the
eyewitnesses as discussed above, as well as
recovery of weapon of offence i.e. 30 bore pistol
on pointation of the accused/appellant.

12. The evidence of recovery of pistol
on pointation of the appellant cannot be
disbelieved for the mere reason that the witness
namely Fazal Wahid while recording his
statement as PW-4 had given certain concessional
statement in favour of the accused/appellant.
There had been other evidence in support thereof,
in the shape of statements of Qadar Khan
Constable recorded as PW-5 and _ the
Investigating Officer namely Muhammad Anwar

Sub Inspector recorded as PW-12, who have

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag [brahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
@

-16-

stood consistent in respect of recovery of weapon
of offence on pointation of the appellant.

13. Learned counsel for appellant has
also agitated that co-accused namely Sardar had
not been named by the eyewitnesses, in their
statements recorded as PW-2 and PW-3, this fact
may be more relevant in the trial of the
co-accused but it is important that said
co-accused had not been attributed any effective
role in the occurrence by the lady deceased while
recording her first statement of the occurrence.
He had only been assigned the role of standing in
the door of the house. Not naming the said co-
accused by the two eyewitnesses cannot be taken
to disbelieve the evidence of prosecution against
the appellant in respect of whom evidence of the
prosecution have remained consistent otherwise.
14, As a result of cumulative effect of
evidence of the prosecution, we have come to the
conclusion that the appellant had rightly been
found guilty of commission of the offence. His
sentence however requires a rethinking. Deceased
had been real daughter of the appellant and the

motive stated by him in his confessional

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishttaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-17-

statement was of such a nature that the appellant
may have felt himself compelled due to existing
norms *in the society, to commit the offence.
Besides, minor weaknesses in the evidence of
prosecution as discussed above may not be taken
as a justification for the outright acquittal of the
appellant, but such weaknesses may be
considered for reduction of the sentence as held
by Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Mst, Bevi

ws _ Ghulam Shabbir and another” reported as

“1980 SCMR 859”, wherein the Hon’ble Court

had observed;

“It has been held in some cases that the principle
underlying the concept of benefit of doubt can in
addition to the consideration of question of guilt or
otherwise, be pressed also in matter of sentence. As a
definite motive was asserted against the respondent
and the same has failed, keeping in view all the
circumstances of this case, it would not be necessary
to impose the capita’ punishment. Therefore while
finding him guilty; under section 302, P. P. C. he is
sentenced to transportation for life should be awarded
as compensation.”

A similar view has also been
recorded by Hon’ble Apex Court in the case

of “Mir Muhammad alias Miro v/s The

State” reported as 2009 SCMR 1188. Further

reliance may also be placed on judgments in

the case of “Muhammad Ayaz Khan v/s

?

Murtaza and other” reported as 2008 SCMR 984
and the case of “Kamran Ullah v/s The State
and another” reported as 2020 SCMR 1214. The
appellant was also a person of 68 years of age at
the time of commission of the offence. All such

circumstances are taken as sufficient justification

_ for reduction of the sentence from normal penalty

of death to life imprisonment. Resultantly, the
instant appeal is partially allowed to the extent
that the sentence of death awarded to the
appellant under section 302 (b) PPC is reduced to
life imprisonment. Benefit of section 382-B_
Cr.P.C is extended to the appellant as well. Rest
of the sentences awarded by learned trial Court
through the impugned judgment shall remain
intact. Murder Reference No. 9-M of 2019 is
answered in “negative”.
