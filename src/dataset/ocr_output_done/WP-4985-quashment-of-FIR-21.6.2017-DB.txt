Vs.
The State and others.

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 21.06.2017

Petitioner: (Shahid Khan, etc) by Mr. Muhammad Faroog Afridi,

advocate.
The State and others by Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, AAG,
eee
SHAKEEL AHMAD, J. - Through instant

constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioners have
sought the following declaration:-

“On acceptance of this writ petition, the
registration of criminal case/FIR with all
subsequent proceedings may kindly be declared
as illegal, without jurisdiction, without lawful
authority, for ulterior motives and malafide.
This Hon’ble Court may quash the FIR against
the petitioner in the interest of justice.

Any other order deemed appropriate in the
circumstances of the case may also be passed.
The petitioner may be allowed to put forward
any other argument/document at the time of
hearing of this writ petition”.
2. Facts of the case, succinctly required for
disposal of the case in hand are that on 23.11.2016, Imran
Khan, Inspector of the City Patrolling, sent a murasila to the
SHO, Police Station, Gulbahar Peshawar, alleging therein,
that, he has received a reliable information, that, driver
Shujaat Khan No.3911, Incharge of the City Patrolling Shahid
Khan, No.1455/THC alongwith other constables had taken
illegal gratification from Gandamaran (smugglers) during
mobile gasht, someone recorded the video film of taking
illegal gratification by the above named police officials, and
uploaded the same on the face book, the matter was brought to
the notice of high ups, which culminated in registration of the
crime report No.1433 dated 24.11.2016 against the petitioners
at Police Station, Gulbahar Peshawar under section 161, 162
and 165 PPC.

3. It was contended by the learned counsel for the
petitioners that the offence i.e. 161,162 and 165 PPC in which
the petitioners have been charged are non-cognizable and no
police officer shall investigate in non-cognizable case, without
order of the Magistrate having power to try such offence. He
next contended that registration of FIR against the petitioners
offends section 155 (2) Cr.P.C, which is mandatory in nature,
therefore, the impugned FIR is liable to be quashed. He in
support of his contention relied on YER 2016-1279.

4. As against that, the learned AAG submitted that

the police officials are guilty of taking illegal gratification,
therefore, the case was rightly registered against them, he
vehemently opposed the prayer of the petitioners.

5. We have heard the learned counsel for the
petitioners and learned AAG representing the State at length
and perused the record with their valuable assistance.

6. Perusal of section of law i.e. 161,162 and 165
PPC reveals that these offences are non-cognizable. Relating
to the issue, information in the non-cognizable case and
investigation in such cases, have been dealt with under section
155 (1), (2) and (3) Cr.P.C., which reads as under:-

155. Information in _non-cognizable
cases. (1) When information is given to an
officer incharge of a police-station of the
commission within the limits of such
station of a non-cognizable offence, he
shall enter in a book to be kept as aforesaid
the substance of such information and refer
the informant to the ‘[Magistrate]’

(2) Investigation into non-cognizable
cases. No police-officer shall investigate a
non-cognizable case without the order of a
Magistrate of first or second class having
power to try such case [or send the same for
trial to the Court of Session].

(3) Any police-officer receiving such order
may exercise the same powers in respect of
the investigation (the power to arrest
without warrant) as an officer incharge of a
police station may exercise in a cognizable
case.

7. A bare reading of the ibid section discloses that
for recording of information of commission of non-cognizable
offence a book is prescribed known as “Roznamcha or
Station Diary” in which information relating to commission of
non-cognizable offence is entered and generally police would

not initiate any action, and the complainant or informant, after
having a copy of the said report is sent away, and if, the
Station House Officer (SHO) deems it fit to initiate
investigation then under sub-section 2 of section 155 Cr.P.C.
police had to take permission of the Magistrate. Provision of
sub-section 155 (2) Cr.P.C. requiring order of a Magistrate for
investigation of a non-cognizable is mandatory in nature, if
any arrest is to be made then it can only be made after
obtaining warrant of arrest from the Magistrate as required
under section 155 (3) Cr.P.C. This view finds support from
the judgments in case Irshad Begum and others vs. The State
PLD 1961 W.P. Lahore 882, Hussain Bakhsh vs. The State
PLD 1963 W.P. Lahore 46, Muhammad Rashid vs. The
State PLD 1964 W.P. Karachi 381, Muhammad Bashir alias
Doba_vs. The State PLD 1988 Lahore 574 and Sabz Ali
Khan & two others vs. Inspector General of Police KPK & 3

others (2016 YLR-1279). We respectfully follow the view

expressed in the above referred judgments. It is well settled
law that when the law requires a thing to be done in a
particular manner, it ought to be done in that manner or not at
all. Muhammad Aslam vs. The State (1993 PCrLJ-205) may
be cited in this behalf.

8. It is easily seen that mandatory provision of law
was grossly violated by the police by registering the FIR
against the petitioner in a non-cognizable offence without
following the prescribed procedure. The learned AAG was

unable to refute the contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioners, he mainly contended that the petitioners have an
adequate and alternate remedy of approaching the trial Court
for acquittal under section 249-A Cr.P.C, and that the writ
petition is not maintainable.

9. A bare reading of Article 4 of the Constitution
of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 would reflect that every
citizen and every other person for the time being in Pakistan is
guaranteed as his inalienable right to enjoy the protection of
law and to be treated in accordance with law, where-ever he
may be and no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body,
reputation or property of any person can be taken except in
accordance with law. Reliance can well be placed on a
landmark judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
reported in a case titled “Federation of Pakistan and others
vs. Shaukat Ali Mian and others” PLD 1999 SC-1026.

10. Converting to the arguments of the learned
Additional Advocate General that the petitioners have
alternate remedy to approach the trial Court for their acquittal
under section 249-A Cr.P.C. has got no force. Availability of
alternate remedy would not bar the jurisdiction of the High
Court to entertain a petition under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, to redress
the grievance of an aggrieved person, when the impugned
order suffers from want of jurisdiction or is void ab-initio, or
passed in flagrant disregard of law like the present case, the

writ is competent despite availability of alternate remedy. It is
not necessary to direct the aggrieved person to first avail the
remedy under section 249-A Cr.P.C. Each criminal case is to
be judged on its own merit. The main consideration is to be
kept in mind, that if there is no probability of accused being
convicted of any offence, and if proceedings before the trial
Court was allowed to continue would be an abuse of the
process of the Court, wastage of time and a futile exercise. If
the facts of the instant case is examined on the touch stone of
above criteria, it becomes crystal clear that further
proceedings in the Court would be a wastage of time. Perusal
of the contents of FIR shows that the prosecution is not likely
to succeed. For this view reference can be made to the
observation in case titled “Miraj Khan vs. Gul Hameed & 3
others” (2000 SCMR-122).

11. For what has been discussed above, we hold
that FIR was registered against the petitioners in violation of
mandatory provision of section 155 (1), (2) and (3) Cr.P.C.
Resultantly, the case FIR No.1433 dated 23.11.2016
registered at Police Station, Gulbahar Peshawar, against the

petitioners under section 161,162 and 165 PPC is quashed.
