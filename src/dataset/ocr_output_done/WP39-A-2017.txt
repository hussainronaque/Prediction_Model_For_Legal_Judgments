eR HR
SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-
Through instant petition, the petitioner approached
this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, with the
following prayer:-

“It is therefore, humbly prayed
that on acceptance of instant writ
petition, the impugned order
dated 21.12.2016 may graciously
be set aside and application filed
by petitioner for production of
additional witnesses may
graciously be accepted. Any other
relief deemed fit and proper in the
circumstances of the case.”

2. Brief facts of the case are that
respondent No.1 instituted a suit in the Court of

Judge Family Court, respondent No.2 for dissolution
of marriage, recovery of dower, maintenance, dowry
articles and recovery of gold ornaments on
28.08.2014. The learned trial Court summoned the
present petitioner, who appeared before the Court
and filed his written statement alongwith list of
witnesses on 20.11.2014. However, the present
petitioner on 24.11.2016 moved an application for
production of additional evidence of two witnesses
in support of his claim. The learned Judge Family
Court dismissed the said application vide order
dated 21.12.2016. Hence, the present writ petition.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and the available record perused with
their able assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the
petitioner has submitted his list of witnesses
alongwith his written statement in which he has cited
twelve witnesses. However, he produced only three
witnesses. Later, he submitted an application on
24.11.2016 for recording the statement of one Taj
Muhammad and Sher Afzal, drivers and requested the
Court to allow him to produce and record their
statements in support of his case. The said application

was filed by the petitioner after lapse of more than
two years on 24.11.2016. Moreover, the petitioner
has not shown any plausible reason or ground for not
mentioning the names of said witnesses in list of
witnesses submitted by him on 20.11.2014. In the
present case, the petitioner/defendant’s evidence has
been closed on 03.12.2016, and now the case is
pending for final arguments of the parties. Therefore,
at this belated stage the petitioner’s application for
production of additional evidence would not serve any
useful purpose rather it seems that the present
application is an attempt to further delay the decision

of the case, which is not desirable under the law.

5. Keeping in view the above stated facts,
reasons and discussions thereupon, this Court reached
to inescapable conclusion that the present writ petition

is bereft of merits, therefore, the same is dismissed.
