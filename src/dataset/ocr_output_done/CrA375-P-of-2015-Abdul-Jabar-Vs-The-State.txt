dated 28.05.2015 by the learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-V,

criminal revision No.72-P/2015 for
enhancement of the punishment awarded to
the appellant in the instant appeal to that of
normal sentence of death, by Mst. Misraj
widow of deceased-complainant, Aziz Ullah;
and also criminal appeal No.351-P/2015 by
widow of the deceased-complainant against
acquittal of Said Akbar, co-accused in the
case; as the instant appeal as well as the said
criminal revision and criminal appeal pertain to
the same case vide FIR No.755 dated
18.09.2010 under section 302 PPC read with
section 34 PPC Police Station Badaber,
Peshawar.

2. The F.I.R shows that deceased Aziz
Ullah, then injured, reported to Hameedullah
SI in casualty LRH, Peshawar, at 18:15 hours

on 18.09.2010 that he came out of his house
and was proceeding towards the nearby shop
and when reached the path leading to Bazid
Khel at 17:10 hours, the appellant, Abdul
Jabar, and his brother, Said Akbar, sons of
Gul Akbar, came there in a motorcar, and
Said Akbar commanded/directed the appellant
to fire at him, and the appellants accordingly
opened fire at him, causing him firearm injury
on right chest. The motive for the offence was
cited as dispute between them over trees. The
occurrence was stated to have been
witnessed by Muhammad Umar son _ of
Majeed and his son Muhammad Rafique as
well as other people. The injured complainant
also mentioned that his son Abid and other
relatives brought him for treatment to LRH.

3. Hamidullah, SI (deceased) scribe of
the murasila (EX.PW3/1), also added a note
at the end of murasila that statement of the
injured was recorded as ‘dying declaration’;
and the Medical Officer who medically
examined the injured complainant recorded

following endorsement;
“Patient is semi — conscious.

Statement is recorded in my

presence”
The entry at serial No.10 of the daily diary of
the Police Station at 20:15 hours’ on
18.09.2010 shows’ that the _ injured
complainant later succumbed to the injuries in
the hospital, therefore, section 324 PPC was
substituted with section 302 PPC.
4. During investigation, the spot was
inspected by the |.0 on the pointation of
eyewitnesses mentioned in the FIR, and
during spot inspection, 12 empty shells of 7.62
bore were recovered from place A in the site
plan; and points B, C and D having bullet
marks were also mentioned in the site plan;
where point E was added, showing the place
of accused while coming down from the
motorcar. The blood stained garments of the
deceased and a spent bullet were also taken
into possession by the |.O; but only the blood
stained shirt and Shalwar of the deceased
were sent to the FSL, Peshawar, wherefrom

the result was only to the effect that “it was
human blood”. The medical examination of the
injured complainant at 06:15 P.M_= on
18.09.2010 revealed the following:-

“On 18.09.2010 at 06:15 PM |
examined injured Aziz Ullah son of
Safi Ullah r/o Bazed Khel Kohat road,
Peshawar and found the following:

On examination the injured
was semi conscious. There was entry
wound of the right side of the chest
and exit wound on back of right side
chest. Entry wound on right side
nose. The patient was advised for X-
Ray chest and X-Ray head. The
patient was referred to Neuro
surgery, cardiothoracic ward and
radiology for their opinion. Kind of
injury was firearm injury. Nature of

injury given later on.”

After the injured complainant
succumbed to the injuries, his PM
examination was conducted, with the following

report:-

“On 19.09.2010 at 08:30 AM I!
conducted the autopsy of deceased Aziz Ullah

son of Saif Ullah r/o Bazid Khel aged about
38+-5 years identified by Zain Khan and

intestines due to firearm.

Probable time between injury and death---

Both the accused brothers, named in
the FIR, initially, remained at large and were,
therefore, proceeded against under sections
204 and 8/7 Cr.P.C; and challan was
submitted against them under section 512
Cr.P.C; but after their arrest on 16.12.2011,
supplementary challan was submitted against
them to the learned trial Court, where they
were formally charged under sections 302/34
PPC; to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. During trial, the prosecution

produced as many as thirteen (13) PWs, and
besides formal witnesses, also produced
material witnesses like both the eyewitnesses
named in the FIR, namely, Muhammad
Rafique (PW-4) and Muhammad Umar (PW-
5); Doctor Muhammad Yousaf (PW-8), who
conducted autopsy of the deceased; Liaqat Ali
Khan SI (PW-9), the investigating officer; and
Doctor Asif-ur-Rehman (PW-10), the Medical
Officer who conducted initial medical
examination of the deceased-complainant,
then injured.

5. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statements of both the accused were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C. In their statements,
the accused denied allegations of the
prosecution, while pleading their innocence;
but declined to be examined on oath or
produce defence evidence. The learned trial
Court also recorded their further statements
under section 342 Cr.P.C; where-after the
impugned judgment dated 28.05.2015 was
rendered by the learned trial Court/ASJ-V,

Peshawar, whereby accused Said Akbar was
acquitted of the charges, whereas the
appellant, Abdul Jabar, was convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to life
imprisonment as ta’zir, and also compensation
of Rs.300000/- payable to legal heirs of the
deceased and in default thereof to six months
SI under section 544-A Cr.P.C; hence the
instant appeal by the convict-appellant, Abdul
Jabar; connected criminal revision No72-
P/2015 by Mst. Misraj widow of the deceased
for enhancement of sentence of life
imprisonment awarded to the appellant, Abdul
Jabar, to that of normal penalty of death; and
criminal appeal No.351-P/2015 by the widow,
Mst. Misraj against acquittal of co-accused,
Said Akbar.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and learned State Counsel heard; and
record perused.

7. The prosecution placed reliance,
mainly, on the so-called ‘dying declaration’ of
the deceased-complainant, then injured, and

also ocular account of eyewitnesses named in
the FIR i.e. PWs 4 and 5. However, the so-
called ‘dying declaration’ could not inspire
confidence for the simple reason that the
Medical Officer (PW-10) who examined the
complainant in injured condition reported that
he was “semi conscious’, thereby indicating
that he was not “fully conscious’. The
Medical Officer also did not report that the
complainant was fully oriented in space and
time and was able to make a coherent
statement, besides showing the complainant
in full senses, conscious and alert to
surroundings. On the other hand, his further
endorsement on the murasila was only to the
effect “statement is recorded in my presence’.
His such report also loses credibility when
seen in the light of his own report that there
was an entry wound on right side nose, and
further that the patient was advised X-Ray
head and referred to neuro surgery,
cardiothoracic ward and radiology for their
opinion. Besides, addition of note on murasila

by deceased S.1, Hamidullah to the effect that
the statement of the injured was recorded as
‘dying declaration’ would naturally raise
question that how at that stage he was sure
that the injured was going to die; and, as
such, the statement was being recorded as a
‘dying declaration’; because the complainant
subsequently succumbed to the injuries in the
hospital; and according to version of the
prosecution, the complainant was not that
serious so as to raise such a serious concern
about his life. Additionally, the attempt on the
part of the prosecution to show entry wound
on the nose, shown in the medical report, as
an “abrasion” in the PM report would make the
status of the murasila as a ‘dying declaration’
all the more doubtful; more-so, when the
relevant column in the medical report about
names of relative or friend of the injured was
left blank; while in both the inquest and PM
reports Muhammad Umar (PW-5) was shown
as one of the two identifiers of the dead body
besides Zain Khan (PW-1); but, surprisingly,

neither of the two eyewitnesses and close
relative of the deceased mentioned in the FIR,
were either shown present at the time of initial
medical examination of the deceased-
complainant, then injured, immediately after
he was brought to the hospital for treatment
and medical examination, or cited as
witnesses to the so-called ‘dying declaration’
of the deceased-complainant, then injured. All
the above stated facts, discernable from the
record, would render the FIR doubtful as a
‘dying declaration’, in the light of judgments
reported as 2018 P Cr. L J Note 66
(Peshawar), 2016 P Cr. L J 836 (Peshawar),
2016 P Cr. L J Note 36 (Peshawar), 2016 P
Cr. L J Note 90 (Peshawar), 2015 M L D690
(Peshawar) and 2003 P Cr. L J 1186
(Lahore).

8. As regards the testimony of PWs 4 and
5, suffice it to say that neither house of the
deceased- complainant had been shown in
the close proximity of the scene of occurrence
in the site plan, neither houses of these

witnesses were shown somewhere near the
spot in the site plan. The deceased-
complainant reported that he came out of the
house and was proceeding towards the shop,
shown in the site plan as that of Nazar
Muhammad; but no such reason, or even any
other reason was forthcoming for the said two
claimed eyewitnesses, who are son and father
inter-se, and close relatives of the deceased-
complainant. As such, they could at best be
regarded as chance witnesses; but their
testimony, nevertheless, receiving no
corroboration from independent witnesses
residing in the vicinity. Their conspicuous
absence at the time of lodging of the report by
the complainant and also during his initial
medical examination also tend to raise serious
question about their claim as eyewitnesses of
the occurrence. Muhammad Rafique (PW-4)
admitted this fact that blood was oozing from
body of the injured in the vehicle while
travelling from the spot to the hospital and that
his hands and garments were smeared with

blood of the injured; but neither blood was
collected from the spot or the vehicle, nor
blood stained garments of the PW were taken
into possession; and only blood stained
garments of the deceased-complainant were
taken into possession, showing that blood
was, indeed, oozing from the body of the
deceased-complainant; but its absence from
the spot, vehicle and garments of the PW
would also raise question not only about the
scene of occurrence but also about presence
of the PW on the spot at the time of
occurrence; and would also be sufficient to
discredit his testimony as well as statement of
his father (PW-5), who also claimed to have
accompanied the complainant, then injured, to
the hospital. As such, their statements as
eyewitnesses were rendered not worthy of
reliance.

9. Moreover, neither the 12 empty shells
of 7.62 bore, reportedly collected from the
spot near the place assigned to the appellant
in the site plan, nor the spent bullet recovered

from the dead body were sent to the FSL to,
at least, procure a positive result about the
empties and spent bullet fired from one
weapon of offence; particularly when only one
i.e. the appellant out of two accused named in
the FIR was charged for effective firing on the
deceased-complainant. The motive of dispute
over trees, cited in the FIR beside being not
proved, also became doubtful in view of
disclosure by PW-4 about murder of brother of
the appellant/accused for which brother of the
deceased-complainant was charged, beside
another enmity in the village. In the aforesaid
circumstances, neither pointation of the spot
by the accused, without recovery or discovery,
nor abscondance of the accused for some
time would be strengthen the otherwise weak
case of the prosecution. In short, there was
nothing incriminating to implicate the appellant
in the case, warranting his conviction and
award of sentences of life imprisonment and
compensation of Rs.300000/- to him, vide the
impugned judgment of the learned trial

Court/ASJ-V, Peshawar, dated 28.05.2015.
The impugned judgment, together with
conviction of the appellant-accused and
sentences of life imprisonment and
compensation of Rs.300000/-, payable to
legal heirs of the deceased, are, therefore, set
aside, pursuant to acceptance of the instant
appeal by the appellant, Abdul Jabar. The
appellant is, consequently, acquitted of the
charges; and be set free, forthwith, if not
required in any other case.

10. The appeal of the appellant against his
conviction and sentences awarded to him,
having been accepted, and his conviction and
sentences awarded to him set aside, for
reasons enumerated hereinabove, the
criminal revision (Cr.R No.72-P/2015) by the
widow of the deceased-complainant Mst.
Misraj, for enhancement of the punishment of
life imprisonment awarded to Abdul Jabar to
that of normal penalty of death becomes
infructuous; and is dismissed, accordingly.

11. The acquitted co-accused and

respondent No.1 in the criminal appeal (Cr.A
No.351-P/2015) by widow of the deceased-
complainant, Mst. Misraj, namely, Said Akbar
was imputed the only role of
LalkaralCommand in the FIR, therefore, with
the acquittal of main accused and his brother
Abdul Jabar charged for effective role of qati-i-
amd of deceased-complainant, the appeal
against acquittal of the co-
accused/respondent No.1, Said Akbar,
become redundant, in the light of grounds
mentioned hereinabove; hence dismissed
being devoid of merit.

Announced.
