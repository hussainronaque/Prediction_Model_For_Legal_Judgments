4. Rizwan Ahmad deceased was the first cousin of
appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf as well as her fiancé,
whereas, appellant Muhammad Qadeer is the maternal
cousin of appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf. According to First
Information Report (FIR), on 12.07.2017, complainant
Umat Kareem (PW.5), on receipt of information about

causing injuries to his cousin Rizwan Ahmad by someone
in Mohallah Karzon Banda Togh Sarai, he reached the spot
and found his cousin in injured and unconscious condition,
who was shifted to Shaheed Farid Khan civil hospital
Hangu, where he (complainant) made a report to Niamat
Ullah Khan SI (PW.13), wherein he charged unknown
culprit(s) for commission of the offence and alleged that on
satisfaction he will charge the actual culprit(s). His report
was recorded in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 on the
basis of which FIR (Exh.PA) was registered against
unknown culprit(s). After preparation of injury sheet by
Niamat Ullah Khan SI, he referred the injured to medical
Officer for examination and treatment.

5. Dr. Mubarak Shah (PW.11) examined the injured
on 12.07.2017 and noticed a firearm entry wound on his
right side head occipital region with exit on forehead
frontal region. The patient was unconscious. After

injured expired and Dr. Sami Ullah (PW.12) conducted
autopsy on his dead body in Tertiary Care Hospital
Peshawar and opined his death as a result of the aforesaid
firearm injury.

6. On 24.07.2017, complainant Umat Kareem
(PW.5), Khurshed Ahmad, brother of the deceased (PW.9)
and Mst. Robina Ashraf (the appellant), recorded their

statements under section 164 Cr.P.C. before the learned
Judicial Magistrate, wherein they charged appellant
Muhammad Qadeer for murder of the deceased and
advanced a motive that appellant Muhammad Qadeer
wanted to marry Mst. Robina Ashraf who was already
betrothed to the deceased and their Rukhsati was scheduled
to be held on 15.07.2017. Mst. Robina Ashraf (the
appellant) in her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C.
deposed that appellant Muhammad Qadeer had informed
her on mobile Phone No.336-2575489 and 0332-3049091
that he has done the deceased to death.

7. Niamat Ullah SI (PW.13) conducted investigation
in the case, who proceeded to the spot and prepared site
plan Exh.PB. During spot inspection, he secured blood
through cotton from the place of the deceased then injured
and a .30 bore empty Exh.P.1, vide recovery memo
Exh.PC, in presence of witnesses. On 14.07.2017, vide
recovery memo Exh.PC/1, he took into possession the last
worn bloodstained shirt of the deceased then injured and
his mobile set “Samsung white colour” with SIM No.0347-
9382476, produced by complainant Umat Kareem. In the
mobile set of the deceased, the I.O. noticed some doubtful
SMSs/text messages sent from mobile No.0312-8139371,
therefore, he obtained CDR data of the above mentioned
mobile numbers  Exh.PW.13/4, | which _ revealed
connection/contacts between the two numbers. On the

same day, Khursheed, brother of the deceased produced
cell phone having SIM No.0336-2575489, belonging to
Mst. Robina Ashraf (lady appellant). On 19.07.2017, the
I.O. obtained CDR data of the aforesaid mobile phone
number, which was brought on record and marked as
Exh.PW.13/5. He also obtained print record of text of
SMSs from mobile of deceased from the Kiosk of Abdul
Rehman Photo-state situated at main Bazaar Hangu, being
run by one Hayat Ullah, which have marked as
Exh.PW.10/1 to Exh.PW.10/4. He also recorded statement
of said Hayat Ullah under section 161 Cr.P.C. On
20.07.2017, the I.O. received CDR data of mobile SIM of
Mst. Robina Ashraf i.e. 0336-2575489, which was
registered in the name of her father. From CDR data it
revealed that mobile number of Mst. Robina Ashraf was
having contacts with SIM No.0332-3049091 (mobile
number of appellant Muhammad Qadeer). CDR data of
both the aforesaid number is Exh.PW.13/6. The CDR data
further revealed that both the numbers were in contact with
each other on 12.07.2017 at 21.26 hours to 21.43 hours
(the night of occurrence) and mobile number of Mst.
Robina Ashraf with the mobile number of the deceased
then injured at 22.06 hours to 22.26 hours. The I.O.
contacted with Khursheed Ahmad and told him to produce
mobile set along with SIM of Mst. Robina Ashraf, who
accordingly produced the same which was taken into

possession by the I.O. through recovery memo
Exh.PW.2/1. During the investigation the I.O. also came to
know that SIM No.0344-1121682 was also in use of
appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf, therefore, on 21.07.2017, he
applied for obtaining CDR data of the said SIM
Exh.Pw.13/8. Vide recovery memo Exh.PC/2, the I.O. took
into possession mobile set Motorla touch screen having
SIM No.0344-1121682 Exh.P.1, belonging to Mst. Robina
Ashraf, produced by Khursheed Ahmad, brother of the
deceased. He recorded statements of the PWs under section
161 Cr.P.C. including Ashraf Karim, father of Mst. Robina
Ashraf, who alleged that the mobile numbers were
registered on his name, however, were in the use of Mst.
Robina Ashraf his daughter since long. On 26.07.2017, in
light of the CDR data of mobile numbers of the deceased,
appellant Muhammad Qadeer and Mst. Robina Ashraf, the
1.0. also arrayed Mst. Robina Ashraf as accused in the
case, resultantly, section 34 PPC was also added. On
29.07.2017, the I.O. arrested appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf
vide arrest card Exh.PW.13/2. She confessed her guilt
before the I.O. therefore, she was produced before the
learned Judicial Magistrate, where her confessional
statement was recorded. He initiated proceedings under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against appellant Muhammad
Qadeer. On 04.08.2017, appellant Muhammad Qadeer was
arrested, who during interrogation disclosed that pistol

used by him in the commission of offence was taken from
one Muhammad Suleman. The I.O. summoned said
Suleman on 06.08.2018 to Police Station, who accordingly
appeared and produced the said pistol which was taken into
possession by the I.O. vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/1.
He added section 15 KP Arms Act in the case. On
07.08.2017, he produced appellant Muhammad Qadeer
before the learned Judicial Magistrate, where he recorded
his confessional statement. He sent the 30 bore pistol along
with 30 bore crime empty to the FSL on 08.08.2018, report
whereof Exh.PW.13/8 is in positive. He also sent the
bloodstained articles to the FSL, report whereof is
Exh.PW.13/19. On completion of investigation, he handed
over case file to SHO, who submitted challan against the
appellants.

8. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellants were formally charge sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case the
prosecution examined as many as fifteen witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of the
appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,
wherein they denied the prosecution allegations and
professed innocence. They, however, declined to be
examined on oath or to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court, after hearing

both the sides convicted and sentenced the appellants as
mentioned above, hence, these appeals and murder
Reference.

9. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their able assistance.

10. Before adverting to merits of the case and
reappraisal of the available evidence, we deem it
appropriate to met legal objection raised by the learned
counsel for the appellants to the effect that in statements of
the appellant recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., question
“what is your statement and why are you charge? has
not been put to the appellants, therefore, the appellants
have been condemned unheard. In this view of the matter,
he requested for remand of the case to the learned trial
Court.

11. To determine the legal consequence of the
objection raised by the learned counsel for the appellants, it
would be appropriate and advantageous to reproduced
section i.e. 342 Cr.P.C., which deals with recording
statement of the accused, below:-

342. Power to examine the accused. (1) For the
purpose of enabling the accused _to_explain_any

circumstances appearing in the evidence against him,
the Court_may, at any stage of any inquiry or trial

without previously warning the accused, put such
questions to him as the Court considers necessary, and
shall for the purpose aforesaid, question him generally

on the case after the witnesses for the prosecution have
been examined and before he is called on for his
defence.

(2) The accused shall not render himself liable to
punishment by refusing to answer such questions or by
giving false answers to them; but the Court [....] may
draw such inference from such refusal or answer as it
thinks just.

(3) The answers given by the accused may be taken into
consideration in such inquiry or trial, and put in
evidence for or against him in any other inquiry into, or
trial for, any other offence which such answers may
tend to show he has committed.

[(4) Except as provided by subsection (2) of S. 340 no

oath shall be administered to the accused. ]

Bare perusal of section 342 Cr.P.C. reveals that it relates to
the statement of accused that is taken to trial. Its object is
to see whether accused can give explanation of the
incriminating evidence put against him. Its further object is
to give accused an opportunity of explaining of evidence
put against him. Provisions of section 342 Cr.P.C. have
been enacted to safeguard the interest of the accused. The
intention of the provision is the furtherance of the ends of
justice and to enable the court to decide the question of
guilt of the accused. The whole object of enacting this
section is that attention of the accused should be drawn to
the specific points in the evidence on which the
prosecution claims that the case is made out against the
accused, so that he may be able to give such explanation as
he desires to give.

12. In this case, statements of the appellants reveal that

each and every incriminating piece of evidence, relied
10

upon by the prosecution, has been put to them by putting
specific questions. Sufficient and proper opportunity of
giving replies to these questions has been given to the
appellants, which they have availed. The negative response
of the appellants to question; Do you want to produce
defence evidence? Do you wish to be examined on oath as
your own witness? are sufficient for drawing conclusion
that the appellants have been given ample opportunity to
give such explanation as they may consider necessary in
regard to the salient points made against them. Section 342
Cr.P.C. does not provide a specific pattern of questions to
be asked from the accused. The essence of section (ibid) is
that the court is bound to place before the accused every
circumstance appearing in evidence against the accused. In
other words, it is an unalienable right of accused to be
heard and to be given ample chance to offer explanation
qua every bit of incriminating evidence or circumstance
brought on record during the course of trial. In the case in
hand, the learned Trial Court has put a comprehensive
question to the appellants in the language that:-
Q. No.19. “Do you want to add something else in your
above statement”.
Ans: “No I am innocent and falsely implicated”.
As observed above, section (ibid) does not provide a
specific style or direction to be followed in using particular
words of specific characters in question or to formulate a

specific questionnaire for asking particular questions. The
11

above quoted question No.19 is more comprehensive and
exhaustive then question proposed by the counsel for the
appellants. In view of the above discourse, even if the
appellants have not been put a question as to “what were
their statements and why they were charged”, shall not
cause any prejudice to them because in response to
question No.19, they respectively have answered in
negative with explanation that he/she is innocent and has
been falsely implicated. By putting the above mentioned
question, sufficient opportunity was provided to the
appellants for putting forth their versions but they have
replied the same in the Negative. In this view of the matter,
the objection raised by learned counsel for the appellants
being not prejudicial to the appellants, is repelled.

13. Before adverting to merits of the case, we shall at
the threshold like to point out that there is no direct/ocular
evidence in this case. The entire case of the prosecution has
been built upon the circumstantial evidence coupled with
confessional statements of the appellants. It appears from
record that initially nobody was charged by complainant
Umat Kareem in his report dated 12.07.2017. During
investigation, the I.O. took into possession cell phone of
the deceased having SIM No.0347-9382476. He also
noticed some doubtful text messages in the cell phone of
the deceased, sent from cell phone No.0312-81393701 and

No.0336-2575489. On getting CDR data of the above two
12

cellular numbers, it transpired that the former was in the
use of appellant Muhammad Qadeer and the latter was
registered in the name of one Ashraf Kareem, but was
found to be in the use of Robina Ashraf (daughter of said
Ashraf Kareem), hence, for the first time, Mst. Robina
Ashraf, revealed the secret and unravel the crime by
recording her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. She was
found hand in glove with appellant Muhammad Qadeer,
thus she was arrested on 29.07.2017, produced before the
Judicial Magistrate on the same day and date, where she
unhesitatingly got recorded her confessional statement.
Later on, Muhammad Qadeer appellant was also arrested
who reiterated his love story with Mst. Robina and
confessed the guilt by making confessional statement on
07.08.2017 before the learned Judicial Magistrate. Before
dilating upon the voluntariness of confessional statements
of the appellants and its corroboration from other
independent circumstances coupled with the fact that
whether these have been recorded in accordance with law,
we, would like to reproduce the confessional statements

one by one below:-

“Confessional statement of Mst. Robina Ashraf:-
Stated that Rizwan Ahmad son of Hazrat Karim,
resident of Togh Sarai Hangu was my cousin and I was
engaged with him some two years prior to the
occurrence. As my engagement with him was against
my will, therefore, I had complained to my parents,

that I do not like Rizwan Ahmad, but they refused. I
13

wanted to marry with my maternal cousin Muhammad
Qadeer son of Nazir Muhammad and he loves me too.
My and Rizwan Ahmad’s wedding date was scheduled
on 15.07.2017. On 10.07.2017 I along with my family
members came to village Togh Sarai Hangu. On
10.07.2017, before my arrival to Hangu Muhammad
Qadeer had told me that either he will kill himself or
Rizwan. I forbade him from doing so, but he did not
agree. Muhammad Qadeer had reached Togh Sarai
before our arrival. On 12.07.2017, Muhammad Qadeer
phoned me to call Rizwan outside the home on some
pretext. I called Rizwan that I wanted to meet you. So
you have to come down the street in back of house.
Rizwan and me were taling on the phone, when in the
meantime, I heard fire shot and our call disconnected.
In the meantime, kids came inside home and told that
Rizwan has been shot dead. Muhammad Qadeer then
phoned me and told that he shot the deceased in the
head”.

“Confessional Statement of Muhammad Qadeer:-
Stated that Mst. Robina Ashraf daughter of Ashraf
Kareem resident of Bangash Colony Paposh Nagar
Nazim Abad No.5 Karachi, presently Hangu is the
daughter of my paternal aunt. We both fall in love with
each other one year prior to the occurrence. We used
to chat and send messages to each other on mobile
phones. In the meantime, Mst. Robina was engaged
with his first cousin Rizwan Ahmad. She was not
happy on her engagement as she wanted to marry me. I
too wanted to marry her. The date of Rukhsati of Mst.
Robina with Rizwan Ahmad was scheduled. Mst.
Robina Ashraf told me on phone to remove Rizwan
Ahmad from the way as there is no other way. She told
me to kill Rizwan, however, she started scolding me
that I am faitless (Bewafa) and shameless (Beghairat).
Mst. Robina Ashraf was brought to Togh Sarai by her
family, while I had come to Togh Sarai prior to them.
On 11.12.2017 at night time I was present with my
friends in the Baithak situated in Togh Sarai when in

the meantime, Mst. Robina Ashraf called me on my
14

phone and told me to come towards the Baithak of
Rizwan Ahmad to kill him. I took the pistol and went
towards the Baithak of Rizwan Ahmad. Mst. Robina
was present in the door of the Baithak. We both met
and in the meantime, Rizwan Ahmad came there. Mst.
Robina Ashraf told me to fire Rizwan Ahmad. |
opened fire at Rizwan Ahmad, as a result, he got hit on
his head and fell down. Mst. Robina Ashraf went
inside her house and I left for my Baithak. This is my

statement”.

14. The learned Judicial Magistrate who has recorded
confessional statements of the appellants appeared as
PW.6. He deposed that on 29.07.2017, Mst. Robina Ashraf
appellant was produced before him for recording her
confessional statement. He directed all the police officials
including Naib Court and APP to leave the Court room so
as to relax her from any sort of fear and pressure. She was
given sufficient time thrice for pondering over her
statement, he disclosed his identity to her and told her that
she is not bound to make a confession and if she does so it
will be used against her as evidence. She was also
explained about the consequences of her confessional
statement. After due satisfaction, the learned Judicial
Magistrate recorded her confessional statement, which was
read over to her and she after admitting it correct
signed/thumb impressed the same. He (PW.6) exhibited
confessional statement of the appellant as Exh.PW.6/2.
Similarly, on 07.08.2017, the learned Judicial

Magistrate, also recorded confessional statement of
15

appellant Muhammad Qadeer, after observing the above
mentioned legal formalities, which is marked as
Exh.PW.6/5. The same was read over to the appellant
Muhammad Qadeer, who after admitting it correct signed
the same. The learned Judicial Magistrate (PW.6) was
subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by the
defence but nothing has been brought from his mouth that
confessional statements of the appellants were the result of
torture, force, coercion or promise. The relevant questions
with regard to making of confession on the basis of force,
coercion, torture, promise and inducement have been
replied by both the appellants in the negative. Appellant
Mst. Robina Ashraf had been arrested on 29.07.2017 and
on the same date without any physical remand she has
confessed her guilt before the learned Judicial Magistrate,
therefore, the same by no stretch of imagination can be
termed as a result of any pressure or torture. Similarly, an
iota of evidence has not been brought on record to show
remotely the confessional statement of appellant
Muhammad Qadeer to be result of any coercion and
torture. In view of the statement of learned Judicial
Magistrate (PW.6), coupled with the confessional
statements of the appellant, we are firm in our view to hold
that confessional statements of the appellants are voluntary
and free from any sort of force, pressure, torture,

inducement and promise.
16

15. The confessional statement of the appellants find
corroboration from other circumstances of the case, like
medical evidence in the shape of autopsy report of the
deceased and statements of medical Officers who
examined the deceased then injured Rizwan Ahmad and
autopsy on his dead body. In confessional statements, both
the appellants have stated that Rizwan Ahmad deceased
was shot on his head. Dr. Mubarak Shah (PW.11),
examined who examined the deceased then injured found
firearm entrance wound on right side head, occipital region
with corresponding exit on frontal region of his head.
PW.12 Dr. Sami Ullah, who conducted postmortem of the
deceased, has also affirmed the firearm wound on occipital
region with its corresponding exit on frontal region of head
of the deceased. The motive advanced by complainant
Umat Khan and PW Khursheed, brother of the deceased
that Mst. Robina Ashraf was engaged with the deceased
and their marriage was going to be solemnized on
15.07.2017, has been admitted by both the appellants in
their confessional statements. The occurrence has taken
place on 12.07.2017 i.e. two days prior to Rukhsati of
appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf. Mobile set Samsung white
colour bearing SIM No.0347-9382476 Exh.P.2 belonging
to deceased was taken into possession by the I.O. Record
of the threatening text messages received on mobile

number of the deceased from mobile No.0312-8139371,
17

registered in the name of Appellant Muhammad Qadeer
has also been obtained which are Exh.PW.10/1 to
Exh.PW.10/4._ Mobile Nos.0336-2575489 and Mobile
No.0332-30349091, have been registered in the name of
father of appellant Mst. Robina Ashraf. CDR data of the
mobile numbers of both the appellants and that of the
deceased has been brought and exhibited by the I.O. during
his statement, perusal of which reveals that the two
appellants and the deceased were in contact with each other
on the night of occurrence till the time of occurrence.
Similarly, the pre and post occurrence contacts of the two
appellants on their mobile numbers with each other further
strengthens the prosecution case and corroborates their
confessional statements. As per FSL report the crime
empty of 30 bore recovered from the spot has been fired
from the 30 bore pistol shown recovered from the appellant
Muhammad Qadeer. Muhammad Sulman from whom the
appellant had taken the crime pistol has been examined as
PW.3. He deposed that the said pistol was taken from him
on 13.07.2017 by Appellant Muhammad Qadeer on the
pretext of making firing in marriage ceremony of Rizwan
Ahmad deceased, which was later on returned to him by
the appellant. He deposed that on 06.08.2017, the local
police summoned him to PS for production of the said
pistol. He visited the PS, handed over the pistol to the

appellant inside the Police Station and from his possession
18

the same was recovered by the I.O. in his presence. The
above mentioned pieces of circumstantial evidence fully
corroborate the confessional statements of the appellants.

16. Though, the appellants have retracted their
confessional statements in their statements under section
342 Cr.P.C., but it is settled law that conviction of an
accused can be recorded on the basis of retracted judicial
confessional if the same was proved voluntary, true and
corroborated by other strong circumstances of the case.
Mere denial of accused in statement under section 342
Cr.P.C. that confessional statement was not voluntary or
that he/she has not made such statement would not make
his/her confessional statement inadmissible. As per ratio of
judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Manjeet Singh Vs the State” (PLD 2006 Supreme
Court 30), retracted confession either judicial or extra-
judicial, if found truthful and confidence inspiring as well
as qualified the test of voluntariness, can be used for
conviction without looking for any other sort of
corroboration. In the judgment supra the Hon’ble Supreme
Court while dilating upon the evidentiary value of the
retracted confession held that no rule of criminal
administration of justice existed to the effect that the court
having found the retracted confession voluntary and true
must look for the corroboration and that in absence of

corroborative evidence, conviction cannot be maintained.
19

Retraction of a Judicial or extra-judicial confession itself is
not an infirmity to be considered sufficient to withhold the
conviction, because evidentiary value of a confession is
not to be diminished by the mere fact that it was retracted
by the maker at the trial. Even an independent
corroboration thereof from other sources direct or
circumstantial, cannot be insisted in every case as a
mandatory rule, rather the rule of corroboration is applied
by way of abundant caution and in a case depending
entirely on the confessional statement of a person or only
on the circumstantial evidence, and this rule is applied
more cautiously. Deriving wisdom from the judgment
(supra) of the august Supreme court, we entertain no
amount of doubt in mind to hold that the confessional
statements of the appellants being voluntary is fully
corroborated by strong circumstances discussed above and
has rightly been based by the learned trial Court for
holding the appellants guilty of the offence to which no
exception can be taken.

17. Coming to the question of quantum of sentence,
from the confessional statements of the appellants it has
been proved up to the hilt that they have committed murder
of the deceased with premeditation so as to remove him
from the way being hurdle in their marriage. The active
role in committing murder of the deceased has been played

by appellant Muhammad Qadeer therefore, he has rightly
20

been awarded death sentence. As the lady appellant has not
physically participated in the crime, therefore, punishment
of imprisonment for life as awarded to her by the learned
trial Court is appropriate and just.

18. For what has been discussed above, the instant as
well as connected Cr.A. No.908-P/2018, filed by
Muhammad Qadeer and Mst. Robina Ashraf, being
meritless are hereby dismissed.

19. Murder Reference No.19 of 2018, sent by the
learned trial Court for confirmation of death sentence of
appellant Muhammad Qadeer is answered in the

“Affirmative”.
