him so much, when by then she was already lying murdered in

4, No doubt, the occurrence is unwitnessed one but the
chain of events and the circumstances definitely link the
accused-petitioners alongwith their co-accused Wagar Shah

with the commission of the offence whereby a young girl was

done to death in a brutal and gruesome manner and then her

dead body was allowed to decompose till it was recovered on
the fourth day of the occurrence. Hence, the accused-
petitioners, being prima facie involved in the commission of the
offence are held disentitled to the concession of bail.
Accordingly, this petition stands dismissed.

Before parting with this order, it is directed that any
observations in this order, being purely tentative in nature,
should in no way prejudice the proceedings before the learned
trial Court and the case be decided strictly on its own merits

after recording evidence.
