MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALL, J.— Appellant, Hazrat
Ali son of Muhammad Younas, has assailed the Judgment
dated 31.05.2022 passed by the learned Judge Anti-terrorism
Court, Bannu Division, whereby the appellant was convicted
under Section 11-F(6) of ATA-1997 and sentenced for one-
year rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.20,000/- or in
default thereof to suffer two months S.I. The appellant was
also convicted under Section 11-N of ATA-1997 and
sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment with fine of

Rs.30,000/- or in default thereof to suffer three months S.I.
2. Facts forming factual canvas of the instant appeal are
that the appellant/accused was charged and arrested in a
crime report No.23 dated 01.05.2020 registered at Police
Station C.T.D, Bannu under Sections 11-N, 11-F(1), 11-F(5),
7 ATA. However, after his release on bail in the case, the
appellant appeared before the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism
Court D..Khan on 30.05.2022 with an application to plead
guilty. On the following day i.e. 31.05.2022, the learned
Judge Anti-terrorism Court Bannu framed charge against the
appellant to which he pleaded guilty and then he was issued
a show cause notice under Section 243 Cr.P.C. to which
appellant/ accused remained firm to his pleading guilty.
Finally, the learned Judge Anti-Terrorism Court Bannu
convicted him under Sections 11-F(6) & 11-N of ATA-1997
and sentenced him as detailed hereinabove. Aggrieved of the
legality of the sentence, the appellant has preferred the

instant appeal.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for appellant and that of
learned Assistant A.G representing the state heard at length

and the record perused with their valuable assistance.

4. The record reveals that the appellant/accused on
30.05.2022 appeared before the learned Judge Anti-terrorism

Court Bannu and submitted an application to plead guilty to
the charges levelled against him. The learned Judge Anti-
terrorism Court Bannu issued notice of the application to the
State for the next day; and on the following day the learned
Court framed charge against the appellant/accused to which
he pleaded guilty. He was then issued a show cause notice
under Section 243 of the Cr.P.C. to which too he did not
change his mind, and accordingly the learned court below
convicted and sentenced him under Sections 11-F(6) & 11-N

of the ATA.

5. The procedure for commencement of the trial of
criminal cases in the Court of Session has been given in
Chapter XXII-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,
and to follow such procedure is mandatory in nature by dint
of provision of Section 265-B of Cr.P.C. This procedure
starts from supply of statements & documents to accused
under Section 265-C of Cr.P.C., not later than seven days
before the commencement of the trial and then Court, after
perusing the police report and all other documents and
statements filed by the prosecution, if is of the opinion that
there is ground for proceedings with the trial of the accused,
it shall frame in writing a charge against accused within the
purview of Section 265-D Cr.P.C.; and if accused pleads

guilty, the Court shall record the plea, and may in its
discretion convict him thereon. Whereas, the learned Judge
Anti-terrorism Court did not make compliance of the
mandatory provision of Section 265-C Cr.P.C, and this
failure on the part of learned court below vitiates the entire
proceedings i.e. framing of charge, plead guilty and award of
conviction & sentence. Besides, noncompliance of such
mandatory provisions is violative of the fundamental rights
of appellant enshrined in Article 4 of the Constitution of
Pakistan. A threadbare perusal of sections 265-B and 265-C
of the Code of Criminal Procedure reveals that obligation of
the Court in both the sections is couched by word “shall” for
observing the procedure, supplying the copies and
commencing the trial with the interval of seven days. The
stage of Charge and plea of guilt under Section 265-D and
265-E, would come after providing copies to the accused.
Evidently, in the instant case, the learned trial court on
receiving application for plead guilty by the accused, issued
notice to the state for the next date and on the following date
charge was framed without adhering to the provisions of
Section 265-C Cr.P.C. which is an uncurable illegality.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of “Nadeem
Ahmed Khan Vs, The State (2007 P.Cr.L.J. 233)”, “The

State through Regional Director Anti-Narcotic Force
Baluchistan Vs, Abdul Wahab and 11 others” (2019 MLD

2048), Imtiaz Ali Vs. The State (2018 YLR 1067).

6. The wisdom for seven days interval between supply of
documents under Section 265-C Cr.P.C. and commencing of
trial is to provide sufficient time to accused person to get
acquainted with allegations against him and also to enable
the Court to study the case and satisfy itself as to whether any
case for trial is made out or not. These provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1898, are in-fact in line with the
provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which

read as under:

4: Right of individuals to be dealt with
in accordance with law, ete: (1). To
enjoy the protection of law and to be
treated in accordance with law is the
inalienable right of every citizen,
wherever he may be, and of every other

person for the time being within Pakistan.
2. In particular-

a. no action detrimental to the life,
liberty, body, reputation or
property of any person shall be
taken except in accordance with

law
b. no person shall be prevented
from or be hindered in doing
that which is not prohibited by

law; and

¢. no person shall be compelled to
do that which the law does not

require him to do.
7. The phrase “in accordance with law” used in both the
parts of Article 4 ibid exactly relates to compliance of
provisions of Section 265-B & 265-C of Cr.P.C, and such
compliance, undeniably, is missing in this case and thereby
it can be safely concluded that the appellant has not been
treated ‘in accordance with law’. It is also pertinent to note
that the appellant is an illiterate person and used to affix his
thumb as is evident from the application filed for plead guilty
and the Charge Sheet coupled with the show cause notice
under Section 243 Cr.P.C. and all this process completed
within the span of two consecutive days. Thus, this court has
a rigid view that the appellant at the time of filing application,
pleading guilty and affirming the show cause was not having
any independent advice nor having adequate knowledge of

accusations against him.

8. Learned Additional Advocate General, representing

the State, during the course of arguments laid a great stress

to the provisions of Section 412 Cr.P.C. which, according to
him, prevents an accused person to file appeal against the
conviction passed on the basis of his plead guilty. We are,
however, not in agreement with what the learned A.A.G.
argued at the bar for the simple reason that Section 412
Cr.P.C. does not prevent an accused person to challenge the
legality of sentence awarded on the basis of plead guilty. For
ready reference, Section 412 Cr.P.C. is reproduced

hereunder:

412. No appeal in certain cases when

accused pleads guilty. Notwithstanding

anything hereinbefore contained where an
accused person has pleaded guilty and has
been convicted by a High Court, a Court
of Session or Magistrate of the first class
on such plea, there shall be no appeal

except as to the extent or legality of the

sentence. (Underline is our emphasis)

9. It is clear from the above extracted provision that after
pleading guilty, still the accused has the right to challenge the
legality of the Sentence. Article 10-A of the Constitution of
Pakistan provides, “For the determination of his civil rights

and obligations or in any criminal charge against him a
person shall be entitled to a fair trial and due process.” It
obviously indicates that a person, in a criminal charge, is
entitled to a fair trial and due process. The terms ‘fair trial’
and ‘due process’ as indicated in supra-Article are
supplement to the provisions of Article 4 of the Constitution,
as due process and fair trial was attached to compliance of
provisions of Section 265-C Cr.P.C. In the absence of due
process and fair trial by providing seven days’ time to
appellant to have a look at and understanding with the nature
of allegations, the conviction and sentence cannot be said to
be legal, hence, the appeal in hand is fully competent and
Section 412 Cr.P.C. does not levy any bar upon filing of this

appeal.

10. Moreover, the instant appeal has been filed under
Section 410 Cr.P.C. read with Section 25 of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997; and latter being a special law provides
a right of appeal against final judgment of the Anti-terrorism
Court, which may be preferred by a person sentenced by a
Special Court to a High Court. There is no differentiation for
a person sentenced on the basis of plead guilty. Hence, the
objection raised by the learned A.A.G. is without any legal

backing hence, overruled.

11. _ As far the notice given to the appellant under Section
243 Cr.P.C. is concerned, the same reveals that the answer to
show cause was also signed by the learned Presiding Officer
of the Court besides the accused, which is not the
requirement of law; rather reply should have been the
statement of accused under his signature or thumb
impression and learned Presiding Officer at the most can
endorse it as “Read over and Admitted to be Correct” or in
short ‘RO & AC’. Therefore, possibility of the reply of show
cause notice, to have been typed by some court officer
mechanically countersigned by the Presiding Officer, cannot
be ruled out, otherwise, the same would have been scribed on

a separate paper.

12. For what has been discussed and observed
hereinabove, the instant criminal appeal is allowed, the
impugned Judgment/order dated 31.05.2022 is set aside, and
consequently, the matter is remitted back to the learned trial
Court to proceed with case on merit in the light of provisions
contained in Chapter XXII-A of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898. As the appellant was on bail during
proceedings and is now behind the bars due to the impugned
Judgment; and it is yet uncertain as to when the trial of

appellant would be concluded, so in the given circumstances

10

of present case, we deem it essential to release the appellant
on bail. Accordingly, appellant is admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- (rupees two
lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned trial court. He shall be released
forthwith, if not required to be detained in connection with

any other criminal case.

13. Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of

even date.

Announced.
