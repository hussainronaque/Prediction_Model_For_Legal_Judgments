2. As per contents of FIR, on 19.06.2010 at 09.00
hours, Fazal Wahab (PW.5) reported to Rahat Khan SI on
the spot to the effect that his son, namely, Abuzar aged
11/12 years used to play cricket with his co-villager,
namely, Ibrarullah (the appellant) in the field near
appellant’s Kandhar (remains of a deserted house), situated
at Khwar Ghara of village Kala Swabi. On 18.06.2010, his
son did not return home, therefore, he (complainant) along
with his relatives started his search near “Khawar Ghra”.
During search of “Khandar” of appellant Ibrarullah, they
saw fresh dumping of mud in the courtyard of appellant’s
Khandar. On removal of the same they noticed legs and
clothes of his deceased son so they informed the police
who reached the spot and recovered the dead body of the
deceased who had been murdered with firearm and his
dead body was put in a pigeon well. He charged the
appellant, his father Rasheed and one Raeef Khan
(acquitted co-accused), for commission of the offence. His
report was recorded in the shape of Murasila Exh.PA/1 by
Rahat Khan SI (now dead) on the basis of which FIR
Exh.PA was registered. He prepared injury sheet and

inquest report Exh.PM/1 and Exh.PM/2 of the deceased
and shifted his dead body to the mortuary, where Dr. Bakht
Jamal (PW.2) conducted autopsy and observed firearm
entry wound 1x1 inch on right side of forehead of the
deceased with corresponding exist on the back of his skull
as well as tears in his anus. According to his opinion the
death of the deceased was instantaneous due to firearm
injury to his skull and brain. In this regard he has furnished
autopsy report which is Exh.P.M.

3. Mir Fazalullah Khan SI (PW.8) conducted
investigation in the case. He proceeded to the spot and
prepared site plan Exh.PB at the instance of complainant,
recorded statements of PWs, took into possession the last
wor blood and semen stained garments of the deceased
Exh.P.1 and Exh.P.2 vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/1.
Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/2 he took into possession a
phial containing anus swab of the deceased sent by the
doctor. He sent the blood and semen stained garments of
the deceased and the phial containing anus swab of the
deceased to the FSL. He arrested the appellant and
recovered a 30 bore crime pistol from his possession vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.7/4. He produced the appellant
before the learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate for his
physical remand and for recording his confessional
statement, which was accordingly, recorded.

4. After completion of investigation, challan was

submitted against the appellant as well as co-accused
Rasheed and Raeef Khan before the learned trial Court,
where they were formally charge sheeted, to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution
evidence was being recorded when on 07.06.2011 the
appellant submitted an application for suspension of the
proceedings on the ground that he is suffering from a
disease of Schizophrenia. He was referred to Standing
Medical Board by the learned trial Court. As per opinion of
the Standing Medical Board, the appellant being unfit to
understand the proceedings, his trial was suspended vide
order dated 29.10.2011. Trial of co-accused Rasheed and
Raeef Khan was concluded, resultantly, they were
convicted and sentenced under sections 201/202 PPC vide
judgment dated 08.12.2012, against which they preferred
Cr.A. No.09-P/.2013 before this Court, which was allowed
and they were acquitted vide judgment dated 19.06.2015.
5. On recovery of the appellant from illness, his trial
was restored vide order dated 08.05.2014 and on
conclusion thereof, the learned trial Court, after hearing
both the sides, convicted and sentenced him vide judgment
dated 23.12.2015, hence, this appeal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

7. No doubt, complainant Fazal Wahab (PW.5) or
any other person has witnessed this untoward incident,

therefore, he could not furnish ocular account, however, it
cannot be controverted that the dead body of the deceased
child has been recovered from a “pigeon well” inside the
bounded premises, in exclusive possession of the appellant.
Besides, another important substantive piece of evidence
with the prosecution is the confessional statement of the
appellant which has been believed and relied upon by the
learned trial Court while recording conviction of the
appellant. Though, the appellant has retracted his
confessional statement during trial, but before dilating
upon the evidentiary value of his retracted confession and
its voluntariness or otherwise, for the sake of convenience,
we deem it appropriate to produce English translation of
confessional statement of the appellant below:-

“Children used to play cricket in his field. On the
day of occurrence at evening time the children after
finishing cricket, left for home whereas I took
Abduzar deceased to my Khandar (remains of a
house). I gave him money to bring watermelon,
which he did. After eating watermelon, I
committed sodomy upon Abuzar and thereafter
committed his murder with my pistol. I threw his
dead body in the “pigeon well”. I called labour
Raeef and we both put mud on the dead body of the
deceased and concealed the same under the mud. I
then went to my home. I have committed the
offence on a motive that Haji Muhammad Nawab
(grandfather) of the deceased used to
blame/disgrace my mother that he has committed

Zina with her on payment of Rs.2000/-.”
8. It is settled law that retracted confession, if
corroborated by independent evidence of reliable nature,
can be made basis for conviction on a capital charge, but it
must be subject to thorough judicial scrutiny. On the
aforesaid principle we would dilate upon the confessional
statement of the appellant. Fazal Wahab and Aman Ullah
(PW.5) and (PW.6), respectively, in their statements have
deposed that during search of the deceased they notice
fresh dumping of mud in the Kandhar of the appellant and
on removing some mud, they noticed, clothes and legs of
the deceased in a “Pigeon Well, so they informed the
police, who reached the spot and helped them in bringing
out the dead body of the deceased from the pigeon well.
Perusal of the confessional statement of the appellant
reveals that he has disclosed therein the same fact as stated
by the PWs that after committing sodomy upon the
deceased and then committing his murder with pistol,
threw his dead body in the pigeon well and then put mud
over the same. In this view of the matter, the confessional
statement of appellant finds corroboration from the
testimony of PWs Fazal Wahab and Aman Ullah as well as
author of the Murasila Rahat Khan SI (now dead).
Dr. Bakht Jamal, while appearing as PW.2 deposed that he
observed one firearm entry wound measuring 1x1 inch on
right side forehead of the deceased with corresponding exit

on his back skull and tears in his anus. He took anus swab
of the deceased and handed over to Fazalullah Khan SI
(PW.8)/Investigating Officer, who took the same into
possession vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/2. The blood
and semen stained garments as well as the anus swab were
sent to the FSL for analysis. According to FSL report, the
semen on the shalwar/trouser of the deceased child was
found to be of human. The Serologist report about the
bloodstained garments of the deceased is also in positive.
The medical evidence as well as the positive FSL reports
support and corroborate the confessional statement of the
appellant. Similarly, a 30 bore crime pistol has also been
recovered from the appellant at the time of his arrest. In
view of the above, we are firm in our view to hold that
circumstantial pieces of evidence coupled with medical
evidence fully corroborate and support the confessional
statement of the appellant.

9. The next point for determination is whether the
confessional statement of the appellant was voluntary or
otherwise. It is trite law that for accepting a confession,
two essential requirements must be fulfilled ie. the
confession was made voluntarily, it was based on true
account of facts, leading to the crime and the same was
proved at the trial. It appears from record that appellant
was arrested on 22.06.2010 and after remaining in police
custody for four days, he recorded his confessional

statement on 27.06.2010. An iota of evidence is not
available on record to remotely show that the appellant
was subjected to any torture, inducement or promise.
Mr. Sher Aziz Khan, the learned Judicial Magistrate, who
has recorded confessional statement of the appellant while
appearing as PW.11 deposed that after fulfilling all legal
formalities within the meaning of section 364 Cr.P.C., he
recorded confessional statement of the appellant; that 30
minutes time was given to the appellant to think over his
confession. Before recording confessional statement of the
appellant, he has answered questions No.4 and 7 of
questionnaire, extract of which are reproduced below:-

Q.4. Have you been subjected to any torture,

threat or force or given any inducement for

making the confession?

Ans. No.

Q7. Are you making the confession

voluntarily?

Ans. Yes.
Replies of the appellant to the aforesaid questions leave no
room for any doubt that his confessional statement is
involuntarily or the result of torture, force, inducement or
promise. Sher Aiziz Judicial Magistrate (PW.11), has been
subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by the
defence but nothing could be extracted from his mouth to
prove that the confessional statement of the appellant was
the result of force, torture, promise or inducement. The
learned Magistrate while recording confessional statement

of the appellant has taken all the precautions and had

faithfully complied with all the formalities as envisaged
under section 364 Cr.P.C. It is evident from record that
during the days of occurrence as well as arrest of the
appellant, his father was an employee of Police
Department, posted as Assistant Sub-Inspector and the
appellant was also a Police Official. In such a situation, a
delay of four days in recording confessional statement of
the appellant would not render it involuntary or result of
torture, particularly, when it is corroborated by other
strong circumstances of the case. Guidance derived from
case titled, “Khan Muhammad and others vs the State”
(1999 SCMR 1818), relevant part of which is reproduced
below:-

“It was further contended that the appellants were
arrested on 09.08.1989 and their custody having
been remanded to the police, their confession was
recorded on 20.08.1989 and therefore, the same
cannot be termed voluntary. We have considered
this aspect of the case and we are of the view that
this issue cannot be resolved in its generality, but
each case has to be considered on its own facts.
Delay_in_recording the confession by itself
cannot render the confession nugatory if
otherwise it is proved on record that the same was
made voluntarily. We are fortified in this view by
a Judgment of this Court reported as Muhammad
Ismail and another vs State 1995 SCMR 1615”.
(emphasis supplied).
In the judgment (supra) it has been further held by the

Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-

“In law conviction on the basis of retracted

judicial confessional alone is sustainable
10

provided the confession has been recorded in
accordance with law. However, by way of
abundant precaution, if we seek corroboration to
the confession, the same is available on record of
the case”. (emphasis supplied).

10. The prosecution’s case rests on the information
furnished by Fazal Wahab (PW.5) to the effect that his
minor son aged about 11/12 years was subjected to
sodomy by the appellant for quenching his lust and then
committed his murder with firearm, followed by putting
his dead body in a ditch, meant for preserving water for
pigeons. The following circumstantial evidence, fully
corroborate version of PW Fazal Wahab:-

i. The corpse of deceased child was recovered
from a pigeon well, situated inside the
abandoned house (Kandhar) of the appellant.
ii. The unnatural death of minor body
instantaneously accrued due to firearm injury
to his skull and brain which has been proved
to be true by Dr. Bakht Jamal Senior
Medical Officer, Bacha Khan Medical
Complex Mardan (PW.2), who conducted
autopsy on the dead body of deceased child
Abuzar.

iii. Positive report of swab extracted by the
doctor from anus of the deceased child and his
last worn semen and bloodstained clothes.

iv. Recovery of pistol as a crime weapon from
the appellant at the time of his arrest.

v. Proved and _ voluntary confessional

statement of the appellant unerringly pointing
11

towards the other circumstantial evidence
collected by prosecution.

vi. The totality of the circumstances appearing
on the record of the case disclosed that
complainant has no motive to falsely involve
the appellant, who resides in his neighborhood
by letting off the real culprit of his minor son.

11. During arguments, though learned counsel for the
appellant referred to certain discrepancies in the
prosecution case to the effect that there is no proof about
ownership of “Kandhar”; that no independent source has
been disclosed by the complainant about getting
information qua dead body of his deceased son inside the
Kandhar; that there is no investigation regarding matching
of semen found on the last worn clothes of the deceased
and semen of appellant. In a case where a child of 11/12
years has been raped and murdered and incriminating
recoveries have been shown effected from the appellant,
the prosecution version cannot be discarded on mere
discrepancies. It is settled law that where prosecution case
is fully established by the testimony of witness, having no
motive for false implication of accused; fully corroborated
by medical evidence, recoveries of incriminating articles
and positive report of Forensic Science Laboratory, then
mere failure or omission on the part of the Investigation
Officer during investigation of the case, could not be
treated as sufficient to render the prosecution case doubtful

or unworthy of belief. In case in hand, the circumstances
12

proved from themselves into a complete chain unerringly
pointing to the guilt of the appellant. We have no
hesitation to add here that there is mark difference between
“discrepancy” and “contradiction”. No doubt, serious
contradictions in the statement of a witness are fatal in a
criminal case, but any discrepancy on the part of
Investigating Officer, either willful or inadvertent, will not
make the prosecution case doubtful.

12. As regards contention of learned counsel for the
appellant that since the appellant is a Schizophrenia
patient, therefore, his case is covered by section 84 PPC,
according to which nothing is an offence which is done by
a person who, at the time of doing it by reason of
unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature
of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or
contrary, suffice it to say that an iota of evidence has not
been produced by the appellant in this regard to prove that
he was suffering from the said disease at the time of
occurrence. After arrest he was produced twice before the
learned Judicial Magistrate for physical remand but he
never disclosed about his alleged illness. The appellant has
also not disclosed about the alleged illness before the
Medical Officer at the time of his post and pre medical
examination during remand. Similarly, at the time of
recording his confessional statement he has not disclosed

the alleged illness before the Judicial Magistrate. No
13

doubt, trial of the appellant had been suspended on the
opinion/report of the Standing Medical board due to his
illness, however, on his recovery from illness, the trial was
restored. No medical record showing previous treatment of
the appellant before the occurrence has _ been
brought/exhibited to prove his alleged illness during the
days of occurrence. The appellant might have ill inside jail
but on treatment he has been recovered. In this view of the
matter, the plea of illness of the appellant would not
advance his case.

13. For what has been discussed above, confessional
statement of the appellant having been recorded in
accordance with law and found voluntary, truthful, and
corroborated by strong circumstantial evidence as well as
supported by the medical evidence, has rightly been
believed and relied by the learned trial Court for recording
his conviction and sentence to which no exception can be
taken.

14. Resultantly, the instant appeal being meritless is
hereby dismissed.
