Date of hearing 07.11.2019

S.M.ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- Through the instant appeal under

section 18 of Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018, the appellant has
called in question the judgment dated 29.5.2019 of learned ASJ-
IV/Judge Juvenile Court, D.I-Khan, whereby he was convicted
under section 377 PPC and sentenced to ten years imprisonment
and fine f Rs.50,000/- or in default of payment of fine, to undergo
further six months imprisonment with benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C extended to him.

2. The prosecution story, in brief, is that on 25.8.2018,
complainant Gul Khan alongwith his minor son namely Arsalan
aged about 11/12 years reported the matter to local police at police
station Daraban, D.I.Khan to the effect that he was on the way to
his house from Gandi Ashiq and when reached near Gandi Eesab,
his son Arsalan met him who was weeping. Upon inquiry, the

minor told that at about 01.30 PM while he was grazing cattle in
-2-

the land situated in the limits of Gandi Esab, accused Momin came
there, tied his hands with chadar, removed his shalwar and
subjected him to unnatural lust. On this report of the complainant,
a case vide FIR No.109 dated 25.8.2018 was registered against the
appellant under section 377 PPC read with section 53 of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 at police

station Daraban Kalan, D.I.Khan.

3. After completion of usual investigation, complete
challan against the appellant was submitted before the learned trial
Court where he was formally charged under section 377 PPC. He
did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. In order to
establish the guilt of the appellant, the prosecution examined seven
P.Ws. Thereafter, statement of the appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and falsely
implication. However, he neither appeared as his own witness
under section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor produced any evidence in his
defence. After hearing arguments, the learned trial Court convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above vide judgment

dated 29.5.2019, hence the instant appeal.

4. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the

parties and have gone through the record.

5. Section 265-D Cr.P.C deals with framing of charge.

For the sake of convenience, it is reproduced below:-

“Tf, after perusing the police report or, as the
case may be, the complaint, and all other
-3-

documents and statements filed by the
prosecution, the Court is of opinion that there
is ground for proceeding with the trial of the
accused it shall frame in writing a charge
against the accused.”
Perusal of record reveals that complete challan against
the appellant was submitted by the local police under section 377
PPC read with section 53 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection
and Welfare Act, 2010. The learned trial Court framed charge
against the appellant under section 377 PPC, however, there is
nothing in the proceedings of learned trial Court that either section
53 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act,
2010 was not applicable in the case or there was no ground for
proceeding with the trial of the appellant under the ibid section of
law. Framing of charge means commencement of trial, object to
make accused aware and alert about the allegations and the basis
on which allegations are levelled against him. Both the sections of
law are penal sections and when section 53 of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 by itself
covers the allegations levelled against the appellant, framing of
charge against the appellant under section 377 PPC is beyond
comprehension. According to section 61 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, the
provisions of the ibid Act shall have an overriding effect,
notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time
being in force, with the exception of any section or sections of any
other law for the time being in force, which may be more

protective in case of a child at risk. There appears no exception
-4-

that section 377 PPC is more protective in the instant case. It is a
cardinal principle that whenever there is a special law, it would
override the general law. Moreover, even if there are two parallel
laws, even then the law which is later in time would prevail.
Mahmood _Khan_Achakzai_and_others. Vs._Federation _of
Pakistan _and others (PLD 1997 SC _426). In the circumstances

narrated above, the framing of charge against the appellant under
section 377 PPC and omitting to frame the same under section 53
of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act,
2010 is against the parameters of law and thus the impugned

judgment is not sustainable in the eye of law.

6. For the reasons mentioned above, this appeal is
accepted, the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence dated
29.5.2019 is set aside and the case is remanded to learned ASJ-
IV/Judge Juvenile Court, D.I-Khan for de-novo trial in the light of
observations made above. In the meanwhile, the appellant shall be

dealt with as an under-trial prisoner.

7. Before parting with this judgment, it is observed with
concern that not only in the case-in-hand but also in other cases of
alike nature, the local police is registering cases against the
accused persons simultaneously under section 377 PPC read with
section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and
Welfare Act, 2010. When Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection
and Welfare Act, 2010 has been promulgated to provide for the

care, protection, maintenance, welfare, training, education,
-5-

rehabilitation and reintegration of children at risk in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa and has been given overriding effect, then such
practice is not justified. Therefore, copy of this judgment be sent to
District Police Officer, D.I.Khan with the directions to circulate the
same to the incharge of police stations under his jurisdiction for
future guidance.
