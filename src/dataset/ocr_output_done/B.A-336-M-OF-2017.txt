“3. The — occurrence pertains to

/ happening on Eid day, the complainant Haider
Ali who is son of the Petitioner was in injured

condition accompanied by the corpus of

Muhammad Faroog. At the time; when they

were taking tea in their house, another brother-

in-law by the name of Akbar Ali was also

present, after a while on hearing noise, persons

by the name of Amanullah, Javaid, Murad,

Ishfag, Sajjad. and Mujahid Ali were present

‘duly armed. They were hitting the door with

their kicks and were calling the deceased

Muhammad Farooq to come out. Complainant

asked all those persons that they have no

concern with him and they should leave that

place. In the meanwhile, the deceased

> Muhammad Farooq came outside alongwith his

_ oo “son Muhammd Rafiq. All those persons started
beating the deceased Muhammad Farooq with

the stick blows. of ‘all those persons, the
complainant and his brother were hit on various
parts of their bodies. In the meanwhile,
Amanullah | and Javaid started firing at
Muhammad Farooq, who was hit and died there
and then. Later the assailants left the place of

occurrence and decamped.

4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
referred to PLD 1962 Supreme Court 502

“Syed _Ali_Bepari_vs Nibaran_Mollahand

others” and 2016 SCMR 18 “ Zaigham Ashraf

vs the State and others” and in view whereof

has taken the plea of right of self-defence, but
on this score the Petitioner cannot be held
entitled to be enlarged on bail, as this plea can
only be taken in his statement to be recorded
before the learned trial Court with strong

evidence in this behalf.

service the complainant is not willing to appear
before the Court and this being bail matter
cannot be kept pending for indefinite period,
therefore, the petition was taken up for hearing

,

on merits.

6. It is almost. clear thet Petitioner
Shams-ur-Rahman was not given any effective

role in the First Information Rerort. For an

afterthought to involve himself, he has narrated

his own version in application under section 164
Cr. P.C. Later this Petitioner was produced

before the learned Judicial Magistrate who even

recorded his volunteered confessional

statement. At the end of confessional statement
he himself being an old rnan has tried his level
best to save the skin of his son Mujzhid Ali and
has taken the burden ‘0 kill the deceased
Muhammad Faroog. It , gives a smell that the

é

confessional statement has been an afterthought

to screen off the real offender from the scene

who is his owr: son. The ctime weapon pistol

was also handed over by the Petitioner to the
i *

i

police, which was sent fer its analysis and the
"clause of section 497 CrP:C. !

Forensic Science Laboratory Report: has
confirmed that the crime weapon, hés been used
in the commission of offence. Thereby in all

probabilities, che Petitioner Shams-ur-Rahman

- himself being held responsible to bring: home

charges against him for, the offence which may

invite punishment falling under the prohibit

7. In view of the: confessional

statement of the accused/Petitioner coupled with
recovery of the crime weapon; and that too
confirmed by the FSL report tentatively the

Petitioner . is linked in chain in his own

prosecution.

Io In view of what has been stated
above, this petition has got no force, which is

hereby dismissed.
