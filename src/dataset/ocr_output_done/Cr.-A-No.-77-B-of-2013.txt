2. Complainant Qadeem Gul through

separate Criminal Revision petition No.24-B of 2013

titled” Qademe Gul Vs the State , seeks enhancement

of the sentence from life imprisonment to death. Since

the instant Cr.Appeal and connected Cr. Revision are

the outcome of one and the same occurrence/ F.IR ,

therefore, these are being disposed of by way of this

single judgment.

3. The story of prosecution as disclosed in
the F.L.R (Ex: PA) which has been registered on the
basis of murasila (Ex: PA/1) may briefly be narrated

as follows:-

On 19.04.2010 at 1115 hours, Qadeem
Gul, the complainant (PW-8) made a report to
Yousaf Khan Muharrir of Police station Teri (PW-5)
at Civil Hospital Terri to the effect that on the day of
occurrence in the morning, women folk of his house
had gone to the fields in order to harvest the wheat

crop but they came back and told male members that
appellant/accused Muhammad Ameer alias Meery,
absconding accused Abdul Aziz and Chamin Khan,
sons of Muhammad Amin, who were armed,
prevented them (women folk) from harvesting the
wheat crop and also complained for abusing them,
on this, complainant Qadeem Gul alongwith his
brothers Zaman Khan and Azam Khan proceeded to
their fields situated at “Gowraky” with intend to cut
wheat crops; that when they reached their fields, the
accused named above who were already present
there duly armed started firing at them with the
intention to kill them, resultantly, complainant
Qadeem Gul and his brother Zaman Khan received
fatal injuries while his brother Azam Khan luckily
escaped; that lateron deceased then injured Zaman
Khan had succumbed to the injuries while reaching
to the hospital. Motive behind the offence as stated
by the complainant is a dispute over the landed
property. The occurrence in addition to the
complainant Qadeem Gul is stated to have been
witnessed by PW Azam Khan. He has charged the
appellant along with his co-accused Mir Nawaz and

Abid Shah for commission of the offence.
4. Above is the narration of complainant
Qadeem Gul in the shape of Murasila, (Ex:PA/1),
which was recorded by Yousaf Khan Moharrir (PW-5)
in the emergency room of Civil hospital Teri. He also
obtained thumb impressions of injured complainant
and his brother Azam Khan as a token of its
correctness, and sent it to Police station Teri through
one Eid Nawaz No.262, where-after, he prepared
injury sheet of injured complainant as well as injury
sheet and inquest report in respect of the body of the
deceased Zaman Khan and handed over to the

Medical officer, through constable Javed Iqbal.

5. PW-4, Shoukat Aman 448 , on receipt of
murasila, has incorporated its contents in shape of
FIR Ex.PA , copy whereof was sent to Falak Nawaz ,
then SI/KBI at Police station Teri, (PW-11) who
proceeded to the crime spot, where he prepared site
plan Ex.PB at the instance of PW Azam Khan eye
witness, took into possession blood stained earth
from the place of deceased, blood stained pebbles
from place of injured Qadeem Gul, vide recovery

memo Ex.PW 6/2. Vide recovery memo ExPW 6/1,
he also took into possession 2 empties of 303 bore
from the place of appellant/accused Muhammad
Ameer, 3 empties of 7.62 bore from place of
absconding accused Abdul Aziz and 4 empties of
same bore from the place of absconding accused
Chamin Khan in presence of marginal witnesses,
were packed and sealed into parcels by him on the
spot. Vide recovery memo Ex.PW 5/4, he also took
into possession blood stained garments of deceased
Zaman Khan and that of injured Qadeem Gul
complainant. He also recorded statements of
marginal witnesses, identifiers and eye witness U/S
161 CrP.C and lateron initiated abscondance
proceedings against all the accused U/S 204 and 87
Cr.P.C. Thereafter he sent blood stained earth,
pebbles, and garments as well as empties to the FSL
for analysis, the results whereof are placed on file as

Ex.PW 11/3 and Ex.PW 11/4.

6. Initially all the accused were absconding,
however, lateron after about two years, present
accused/ appellant was arrested in another case FIR

No.19 dated 6.02.2012 U/Ss 324/ 353/ 216/ 427/
148/149 PPC, PS Gurguri, so PW-2 Rast Ali Khan SI
PS Terri district Karak submitted application before
the Judicial Magistrate Banda Daud Shah for arrest of
appellant/ accused in the instant case. After allowing
said application, accused was summoned through
Zamima Bey by said Judicial Magistrate on 30.6.2012
on which date he was also arrested in the instant case
and after fulfillment of codel formalities,
supplementary challan was submitted in the Court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge Banda Daud Shah
Karak. Appellant/accused was summoned, copies
were delivered to him, formal charge was framed
against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. During trial the prosecution to prove its
case, produced as many as (11) witnesses including
ocular account. On conclusion of trial, statement of
accused/ appellant Muhammad Ameer alias Meery
was recorded U/S 342 Cr.P.C, wherein neither he
wished to produce defence evidence nor opted to be
examined on oath U/S 340(2) Cr.P.C. After hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and

having gone through the record, the learned trial
court convicted and sentenced the appellant, vide

judgment impugned herein.

7. Learned counsel for appellant vehemently

argued that the impugned judgment of the trial court is

the result of misreading and non-reading of evidence;

that the testimony of the PWs are full of contradictions

and discrepancies while ocular account is belied by

medical evidence as well as circumstantial evidence and

the site plan; that the learned trial court has not uttered a

single word with regard to the harvesting wheat crops

and women folk in its judgment, who were also neither

examined by the IO nor as PWs in the court and that the

learned trial court has erred in law while convicting the

appellant, hence the impugned judgment is liable to

reversal.

8. On the other hand, learned AAG, assisted by

counsel for the complainant have strongly opposed the

arguments, advanced by the learned counsel for the

appellant by saying that the Appellant alongwith
absconding accused are directly charged for murder of

Zaman Khan and attempted murder of complainant

Qadeem Gul and Azam Khan, committed in a broad day

light having common intention which has been proved

through cogent, coherent and confidence inspiring ocular

evidence supported by circumstantial evidence in the

shape of various recoveries from the crime venue as well

as through medical evidence, thus, he has rightly been

convicted by the trial Court. They further argued that

FSL report of blood stained earth and pebbles recovered

from the place of deceased and injured/ complainant as

well as Fire-arm expert report of recovered empties are in

line with the prosecution case, hence, the case against the

accused/ appellant is fully established. In support of

criminal revision, learned counsel contended that

prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant upto to

the hilt and in the circumstances, the punishment of
-10-

accused/respondent may be enhanced by awarding him

death penalty.

9. We have heard and considered the submissions

of learned counsel for the parties and learned Additional AG
for the State and gone through the record.

10. We are quite conscious of the factual and

legal position that it is the ocular (direct) evidence which

matters in all criminal cases, “it is not the medical

evidence but ocular account which is to be considered

at first to determine guilt or innocence”. Keeping in

view the said proposition of law, we would like to

examine as to what the prosecution has brought on the

record to prove the charge through ocular evidence.

Examination of the available material; reveals that

prosecution examined complainant/injured Qadeem Gul

as PW-8, while Azam Khan as PW-9 to prove its case.

11. It is manifest from the available record that

ocular account of both witnesses , i.e injured/complainant

Qadeem Gul (PW-8) and Azam Khan (PW-9) have fully
-l1ll-

supported each other in respect of date and time of

incident, place of occurrence and the narration of incident

and even have categorically stated that Appellant/accused

Muhammad Ameer alias Meery, alongwith other

absconding co-accused have been charged directly for

committing qatle-amd of Zaman Khan, causing injuries

to complainant Qadeem Gul (PW-8) and in-effectively

firing at Azam Khan (PW-9); their presence at the time

and place of occurrence cannot be doubted. In this

respect reliance can be made upon case titled as

“Shamshad Ali.... Vs....The State (2011 SCMR 1394).

There is also no allegation of any incorrect identification

of the accused, including the appellant as parties are

known to each other; the appellant could not succeed in

causing a grave dent in the prosecution case with regard

to his innocence despite lengthy and taxing cross

examination. Therefore, sufficient evidence was available

against appellant, thus the learned trial court has not
-12-

committed any illegality in believing the ocular account.

In identical situation, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has

held in case titled as “Pervaiz Ahmad alias Peeja Vs The

State” (2010 SCMR 1733), wherein it is stated that :-

“Since there is sufficient evidence to bring
home guilt to the accused in the form of
ocular version and the complainant party is
having no blood feud enmity to furnish a
ground for creating a doubt in the
statement of the eye witnesses or for false
implication. However, motive for taking

such steps by the petitioner is available”

12. Further, complainant Qadem Gul and PW

Azam Khan are real brothers of the deceased, therefore, it

cannot be believed that blood relations will direct their

finger at innocents, leaving the actual culprits because

such is a rare phenomenon and in normal circumstances

this theory of substitution by blood relations at the cost of

real culprit is ruled out. As regards the plea of witnesses,
-13-

being related interse; it would suffice to say that mere

relationship is no ground at all, to disbelieve the evidence

unless and until it is established by defence that those

witnesses have such enmity or other consideration which

could justify the witnesses to be not of truth. The

reference, if any, can well be given to case-law of

Hon’ble Supreme Court, reported in case titled _“Zahoor

Ahmad Vs The State” (2007 SCMR 1519) wherein it is

held that :-

“The petitioner and the complainant party
are undisputedly closely related to each
other. The petitioner is a maternal cousin
of the deceased, as also the first cousin of
the deceased through paternal line of
relationship and thus, in the light of the
entire evidence it has correctly been
concluded by the learned High Court that
the blood relation would not spare the real
culprit and instead would involve an

innocent person in the case”
-14-

13. As regards the plea of contradictions we also

do not find any substance therein because the defence

counsel failed to pin-point as to what was the material

dent in prosecution case which was sufficient to bring the

principle of benefit of doubt into operation regarding the

case of appellant. The contradictions, not grave in nature,

can be ignored safely as minor contradictions do creep in

with passage of time. In the instant case both witnesses of

ocular account are in confirmatory with each other in

respect of place of incident, its time, narration of incident

and even allegations against the present appellant. In this

respect reliance can be placed on case titled as

“Muhammad Ilyas and others .. Vs....The State (2011

SCMR 460)

14. It is further matter of record that medical

evidence fully supports the ocular account with regard to

death of deceased as a result of fire shots injuries and

since the allegations against the appellant is also that of
-15-

causing fire shots injuries to the deceased, and also to the

complainant, therefore it is quite safe to say that ocular

account was fully supported the medical evidence and

despite lengthy cross-examination to Medical officer by

the defence counsel, could not create any doubt, which

could have favour him or least could have led to an

inference that medical evidence is not in corroboration to

the ocular account, so furnished by the prosecution.

15. As per version of the complainant, motive is

stated to be a dispute over landed property, due to which

the appellant alongwith other accused were not

permitting the complainant party to harvest wheat crops

and this fact was not only agitated in FIR, but also in

their statements before the Court, hence the motive is

proved by the prosecution. Further the complainant

mentioned in his FIR that firstly the accused have

forbidden the women folk from harvesting the wheat

crops and thereby on complaint to Male members, they
-16-

arrived at the spot and were shot fired by the accused,

this leads to the interference that the report has been

lodged by giving natural facts of the occurrence. The

contention of convict/appellant that from the women

folk, no one has been produced before the court to

confirm the such facts, suffice it to say that particularly in

the society of Pakhtun belt, the people avoid to indulge

the women folk in such like litigations and further two of

the eye witnesses have been produced, hence non

production of women folk would cast no harm to the case

of prosecution .

16. So far as the abscondence of applicant/

convict is concerned, admittedly the occurrence took

place on 19.04.2010, wherein the accused absconded,

where after he was arrested in another case vide FIR

No.19 dated 6.02.2012 under sections

324/353/216/427/148/149 PPC P.S  Gurguri, on

30.6.2012 after sufficient abscondence of more than two
-17-

years for which the learned defence counsel could not

furnish any plausible explanation. When the accused

absconds after the commission of offence an adverse

inference can be drawn against him because he has

committed an offence and absconded himself to hamper

the process of investigation of the case but thereafter

during abscontion, he again committed an offence,

mentioned above. Abscondence of the appellant/accused

soon after the occurrence for more than two years is

another significant incriminating piece of evidence

against him. Reliance is placed on PLJ 2008 SC 641.

17. So far as quantum of sentence is concerned,

the case against the appellant has been proved for

committing “gatl-e-amd” of deceased Zaman Khan,

causing injury to complainant Qadeem Gul and

ineffective firing at Azam Khan beyond any shadow of

doubt. The appellant /convict is aged about 27/28 years

and role of firing has also been attributed to him
-18-

alongwith other absconding accused, having common

object, for which the learned counsel for the

appellant/convict could not brought on record that how

many shots caused fatal to deceased as well as injured

apart from the absconding accused. Further, admittedly it

is not a case of preplanned murder, rather the occurrence

took place at the spur of moment after forbidding the

women folk from harvesting wheat crops, hence, the

mitigating circumstances do exist, due to which normal

penalty of death is not awarded, rather sentence of life

imprisonment, as awarded to the appellant by the learned

trial court would be sufficient in the interest of justice

which is in accordance with law and no exception can be

taken from it.

18. For what has been discussed above, the

learned trial court has rightly appreciated the evidence in

its true perspective. We find no illegality or irregularity,

which may warrant interference in the well reasoned
-19-

findings of trial court. Thus instant appeal stands

dismissed and consequently the Criminal revision No.24-

B of 2013 filed by complainant Qadeem Gul for

enhancement of sentence has become infructuous, hence

dismissed.

Announced.
