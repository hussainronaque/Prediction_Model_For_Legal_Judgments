Review Petition NO. 07-A/2017.

Present:- M. Arshad Awan Advocate for petitioner.

Mr. Yasir Zahoor Abbasi, AAG for the
State.

Syed Arshad Ali_J.- Through the instant criminal review
petition, the petitioner seeks review of the order dated
15.09.2014, whereby appeal of petitioner against the judgment
passed by learned Special Judge Anti-Corruption (Provincial)
Khyber Pakthunkhwa Campat Abbottabad on 16.11.2012 was
dismissed.

2. The petitioner was sentenced the learned Special Judge
Anti-Corruption to undergo

i. 3 years RI with a fine of Rs. 500,000/-
or in default thereof shall undergo six
months SI under Section 471 PPC.
ii. 2 years RI with a fine of Rs. 300,000/-
or in default thereof shall undergo six
months SI under Section 5 (2) PC Act.

Along with the appeal, the petitioner also filed an

application under Section 426 Cr.P.C. This Court vide order

dated 26.12.2011, allowed the said application and ordered the

Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

release of petitioner on bail subject to furnishing of bail bonds
in the sum of Rs. 100,000/- with two sureties each in the like
amount. On 18.11.2013, since the petitioner was absent when
the case came up for hearing, hence, non-bail-able warrant of
arrest were issued against him as well as against sureties.
However, the sureties of the petitioner filed an application for
cancellation of the warrant of arrest which came up for hearing
before this Court on 08.07.2014. This Court was pleased to
cancel the warrant of arrest issued against the sureties with the
directions that they shall produce the present petitioner on
11.08.2014. The order sheet dated 11.08.2014 shows that
“Present: parties in persons” and on the request the case was
adjourned. On 28.08.2014 again the order sheet reflects
“Present: the parties in person”. However, due to the absence
of the learned counsel for the parties, case was adjourned. The
case finally came up for hearing on 15.09.2014 before this
Court. This Court vide order dated 15.09.2014 dismissed the
appeal of the present petitioner and also ordered forfeiture of
the bail bonds and initiation of proceeding under Section 514-
A Cr.P.C. This Court has specifically mentioned in Para 3 of
the judgment dated 15.09.2014, “On merit, the prosecution has
proved the charge against the convict/appellant, beyond any
shadow of doubt and as such he was rightly convicted and

sentenced by the trial Court”.

Aftab P.S/*

Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

3. Along with the review petition, the petitioner has also
filed an application for condonation of delay in filing the
review petition.

4. Mr. Muhammad Arshad Awan, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the petitioner has argued that through
the impugned order the appeal was not dismissed on merit and
this Court while dismissing the appeal, has not appreciated the
evidence. He further argued that indeed the petitioner was
present before this Court on the date preceding on which the
impugned order was passed, however, this fact was not brought
to the notice of this Court, hence the impugned order has been
procured through misrepresentation, hence review petition is
maintainable. He has relied on “Manzoor Ahmed and 2 others--

--vs----Muhammad Nawaz PLD 2013 Lahore 123” and “Mian

Muhammad Nawaz Sharif---Vs---The State PLD 2009

Supreme Court page 814”.

5. Learned AAG appearing on behalf of the state while
controverting the arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner has stated that the review petition is not maintainable
and this Court has no authority or jurisdiction to alter the

sentence of conviction in view of bar contained in Section 369

of Cr.P.C.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
7. Like an appeal or revision, the power to review judgment

Aftab P.S/*

Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

or order is a creation of statute. Unless this power has been
specifically conferred upon a Court through an explicit
provision of law, the court can’t review its order/judgment. The
Court has no inherent power to review its judgment or order
even if the same is based on incorrect appreciation of evidence
qua law. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in case

“Hussain Bakhsh vs. Settlement Commissioner, Rawalpindi

and others, PLD 1970 Supreme Court 1” held:-

The right to claim review of any decision of
a Court of law, like the right to appeal, is a
substantive right and not a mere matter of
procedure. An appeal, as observed by Branwell, L.
J., in the case of Sandback Charity Trustees V.
North Staffordshire Railway Co. (1)---

“does not exist in the nature of things ; a
right to appeal from any decision of any Tribunal
must be given by express enactment.”

This is equally true in case of review,
because both appeal and review, though they
differ in scope, are substantive rights. As such,
neither of them is available unless it has been

’

conferred by law.’

Similarly, the stated view was adopted by the august
Supreme Court in “Muzaffar Ali vs. Muhammad Shafi, PLD
1981 Supreme Court 94” whereby in para 8 of the judgment it
was held:-

“Before proceeding further, it may be

pointed out that right of review is a substantive

Aftab P.S/*

Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

right and is always a creation of the relevant
Statute on the subject. See Hussain Bakhsh V.
Settlement Commissioner, Rawalpindi and others
(1), where at page 5, it was held that :--

“The right to claim review of any decision
of a Court of law, like the right to appeal, is a
substantive right and not a mere matter of
procedure. An appeal, as observed by Bronwell,
L.J., in the case of Sandback Charity Trustees v.
North Staffordshire Railway Co. (1877) 3 O BD
]—

“does not exist in the nature of things ; a
right to appeal from any decision of any
Tribunal must be given by express enactment.

This is equally true in case of review,
because both appeal and review, though they
differ in scope, are substantive rights. As such,
neither of them is available unless it has been
conferred by law.”

Examining the present case in the light of

the above principle, it will be evident that, in the
Ordinance under consideration, there does not
exist any express power of review of the judgment
and order of the High Court passed by it in
Second Appeal under section 15 (4). Learned
counsel for the respondent herein could not refer
to any express provision in the Ordinance which
could suggest that existence of any such power in
the High Court, and his arguments were of some
indirect approach to this subject to which we shall

presently attend.”

The same view has also been re-affirmed by the august

Supreme Court of Pakistan in “S.A Rizvi Vs. Pakistan Atomic

Energy Commission etc. 1986 SCMR 965.”

Even otherwise, Section 369 Cr.P.C. placed in Chapter

Aftab P.S/*

Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

XXVI of the Cr.P.C bars the Court administering criminal
jurisdiction to alter its judgment after it has been written,
signed and pronounced, except to correct a clerical error. For
ease reference, Section 369 is reproduced as under:-

369. Court not to alter judgment. Save as
otherwise provided by this Code or by any
other law for the time being in force or, in
case of a High Court, by the Letters
Patent of such High Court no Court when
it has signed its judgment, shall alter or
review the same, except to correct a
clerical error.

In Muhammad _Khalil-ur-Rehman_ Vs. Mst. Shabana
Rahman and another (PLD 1995 SC 633) when the worthy
Apex Court was dealing with the alike matter,it was observed
that;

“Tt is not disputed before us by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that there is no
provision for review in the Code of criminal
Procedure against the order passed by a Court. It
is, however, contended by the learned counsel that
under section 561-A Cr.P.C. the Court has the
jurisdiction to modify or alter the order passed by
it. In support of his contention that a Criminal
Court passing an order has the jurisdiction under
Section 561-A Cr.P.C. to review its order, the
learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on the
case Gulzar Hassan Shah V. Ghulam Murtaza
(PLD 1970 SC 335). The facts in that case were

that that the respondents in that case were

allowed bail by the trial Court. The order granting
bail to the above respondents was challenged
before the High Court and a learned Judge in
Chambers of Lahore High Court passed the order
for cancellation of the bail of respondents in that
case in their absence. The respondents came to
know about the ex parte order passed by the
learned Judge in that case at about 2 p.m. on the
same day and they filed application under section
561-A, Cr.P.C. with the prayer that the order
cancelling their bail bet set aside and they may be
admitted to bail. This application was heard by
another learned Judge in Chambers of Lahore
High Court who allowed the same. This order
allowing the application of the respondents in that
case under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. was challenged
before this Court and leave was granted to
consider, whether the High Court in its inherent
jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. can
reverse the order made by it? This Court came to
the conclusion that the provisions contained under
section 369, Cr.P.C. do not control provisions of
section 498, Cr.P.C. and that in appropriate case
Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. can be invoked. It was
further held in that case that order passed under
Section 498, Cr.P.C. does not qualify to be a
judgment within the meaning of section 369,
Cr.P.C. and as such section 369, Cr.P.C. did not
apply. It was finally observed by this Court while
discussing the scope of Section 561-A, Cr.P.C. as
follows:-

“IT am conscious of the fact that general
principles of finality of judgment

Aftab P.S/* Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

attaches to the decision or order of the
High Court passed in criminal cases.
But it will not apply to cases where an
order is passed without jurisdiction or
without giving any opportunity to the
parties of being heard. In such cases
section 561-A, Cr.P.C. can be invoked
for the purpose of doing justice between
the parties and for seeing that the act of
the Court does not injury to any of the
parties. This is an inherent power of the
Court and has been preserved by the
above provision of law. In my opinion in
rare and exceptional cases the High
Court has inherent power to invoke,
review or alter its own earlier decisions
in cases which are not governed by
Sections 369, 424 and 430, Cr.P.C. with
a view to give effect to any order under
the Code or to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court or otherwise to
secure the ends of justice. It is, however,
not possible to enumerate _ the
circumstances in which this provision
can be invoked. It may, however, be
mentioned that the learned counsel for
the appellant has conceded that
application for bail can be made from
time to time on fresh material. There is
thus no difficulty in such cases.”

We are, therefore, of the view that the above case
cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner is
no authority for the proposition that an order
passed by a Criminal Court can be reviewed
under section 561-A, Cr.P.C. Section 561-A,
Cr.P.C. deals with the inherent power of the Court
and therefore, keeping in view the principle that
no one should suffer on account of the act of the
Court, it cannot be denied that in all such cases
the Court can correct a wrong done to a party in

exercise of its inherent power under Section 561-A

Cr.P.C. the facts of the above-cited case clearly

Aftab P.S/* Justice Syed Arshad Ali.

show that the bail granted to respondents in that
case was cancelled by the Court without hearing
the affected party. It was in this context that this
Court observed that an order without jurisdiction
could be recalled and varied by the Court in
exercise of its inherent power under Section 561-A

Cr.P.C.”

Similarly in case “Imdad_ Ali Khawaja vs. The State
and others (2016 SCMR 2057)”it was held by the august
Supreme Court in para 5 of the judgment that:-

“Once an order is passed by one Bench, the other Bench
cannot review such an order ordinarily. In proceedings
with the matters in criminal jurisdiction, the High Court

does not have the power to review an order.”

This view also reflects in judgments reported in
judgment reported in “20/6 PLD 195 Peshawar, 2013 PCrLJ
767 Peshawar, 1971 PCrLJ S.C 483, PLD 2015 S.C 322, PLD
2004 SC 911, 2014 SCMR 1609, 2012 SCMR 334, 2008 SCMR
165, 2008 SCMR 880, PLD 2004 SC 32, 2002 SCMR 1239,
2002 SCMR 1611 and PLD 2001 S.C 433.”

8. Now moving to the judgments produced by the learned
counsel for the petitioner. In Manzoor Ahmed’s supra case the
learned Lahore High Court was dealing with an issue of review
of the order passed by the High Court under its constitutional
jurisdiction. In that case, the petitioner sought quashment of

FIR through a writ petition. The said writ petition was allowed

and the FIR was quashed, however, later, the respondent of that

case challenged the order of the learned High Court through a
petition under Section 12 (2) CPC. The said application was
also dismissed where after, the applicant/respondent challenged
the said order through intra-court appeal which was also
dismissed by the learned High Court. It was in that scenario,
the learned High Court held that in case of fraud and
misrepresentation, the High Court had the jurisdiction to
review its order as CPC is applicable to constitution
jurisdiction. In Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif’s case, the
facts and circumstances of the case are altogether different as
the august Supreme Court was hearing an appeal from
judgment of Sindh High Court. In the circumstances, I hold
without any hesitation that this Court has no jurisdiction to
review the order passed by this Court dated 15.09.2014 which
was passed under the criminal appeal jurisdiction of this Court.
Resultantly, the instant petition along with Criminal
Miscellaneous application No. 447-A of 2017 and Cr.M
application No. 448-A of 2017 are dismissed being not
maintainable.
