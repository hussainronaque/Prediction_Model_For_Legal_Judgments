SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-

Accused-petitioner Muhammad Dilar, after having
been refused bail by the learned lower Court in case
FIR No.32, dated 18.12.2016 under sections 302/109
of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, read with section 15
AA KPK, registered at Police Station Lora, District
Abbottabad, has approached to this Court for the same
relief by filing the instant bail petition.

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner, as reveals from the report of Fazal-i-Tariq
son of Fazal-i-Rabbi, complainant lodged by him on

18.02.2016 at 1400 hours, is that her sister Mst.
Nooria Bibi was married to accused/petitioner, who
committed her murder at the instance of his first wife
by firing at her.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and learned State Counsel heard
and the record perused. The complainant despite his
personal service refused to appear before the Court.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that the
accused/petitioner has also lodged a report in PS Lora
regarding the occurrence, which was recorded in the
Daily Diary at Serial No.16 dated 16.02.2016,
wherein, he alleged that on the day of occurrence he
left home at 7.30 am for his work and his brother
informed him that Mst. Nooria Bibi, his wife had
committed suicide with 12 bore shot gun. No doubt,
the present accused/petitioner is directly charged in
the FIR by the complainant for committing Qatl-i-
Amd of his wife but the occurrence was not witnessed
by the complainant or anybody else. The accused/
petitioner informed the complainant about the
occurrence on the same day and the complainant party
brought the dead body of deceased Mst. Nooria Bibi
from the house of accused/petitioner to his native
village and buried her. After two days of the

occurrence on 18.02.2016, the complainant submitted
an application to DSP, Circle Havelian, Abbottabad
wherein, he charged the accused/petitioner for murder
Mst. Nooria Bibi, sister of the complainant. In
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in hand,
the case of the present accused/petitioner is that of
‘further inquiry’ into his guilt under subsection 2 of
section 497 Cr.P.C.

5. The observations of this Court rendered
hereinabove, would not affect the case of the
accused/petitioner during the trial, in any manner
whatsoever.

6. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted and Muhammad Dilar son of Muhammad
Sabir, accused-petitioner is admitted to bail, subject to
his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/-
(Rupees one lac) with two sureties each in the like

amount, to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
