SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Zafar Saeed, the appellant
assailed the judgment dated 25.02.2019 of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Karak, whereby the accused/ appellant involved
in case F.LR No. 14 dated 09.02.2017, registered at Police
Station, Sabir Abad, District Karak, has been convicted under
section 302 (b) P.P.C and sentenced to death with fine
Rs.500000/- (five lacs), as compensation to the LRs of deceased
under section 544-A Cr.P.C, in default thereof to further

undergo six months SI. Murder Reference No.2-B/2019 has also
been sent by the learned trial Court, hence this judgment shall
decide both.

2. The background of the prosecution case according to
the FIR, is that on 09.02.2017 at 13.00 hours, complainant Gul
Daraz Khan brought dead-body of his brother Gul Riaz Khan alias
Gula Khan to the Police Station Sabir Abad and reported the matter
to Nazeer Badshah ASI, to the effect that he alongwith his brother
Gul Riaz alias Gula Khan went to the house of Haji Gul Shaheed.
They were sitting in the courtyard of his baithat and were busy in
gossiping, in the meanwhile at about 10.49 hours, accused Zafar
Khan son of Abdul Saeed Khan, duly armed emerged and started
firing at Gul Riaz with intention to kill, as a result of which he was
hit and died on the spot. He and Gul Shaheed Khan present there
could do nothing being empty handed. The accused after
commission of the offence decamped from the spot. Motive for the
offence alleged by the complainant was dispute over women folk.
The report was taken vide F.LR  Ex:PA. Yar Muhammad ASI
(PW-08) conducted investigation and on its completion submitted
complete challan against the accused/ appellant. Accused Zafar
Saeed alias Zafar Khan was summoned, who was produced in
custody and after providing relevant copies under section 265-C
Cr.P.C, he was formally charge sheeted on 26.02.2018, to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to

prove its case against the accused/ appellant produced and
examined as many as nine (09) witnesses. After conclusion of
prosecution evidence, statement of accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence, he did not
wish to be examined on oath as provided under section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C, nor opted to produce defence evidence. The learned trial
Court after hearing arguments of learned counsel for the parties
vide impugned judgment dated 25.02.2019 convicted and
sentenced the accused/ appellant as mentioned above, hence, the
instant criminal appeal and murder reference.

3. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and learned Addl. A.G representing the state and perused
the record with their valuable assistance.

4. It was on 09.02.2017, when the complainant
alongwith the deceased visited the baithak / hujra of one Gul
Shaheed for a personal errand. On reaching there they met Gul
Shaheed PW-07 and sat in the courtyard of the baithak, when in the
meanwhile the accused/ appellant emerged duly armed with AK47,
started firing upon the deceased, who died on the spot and the
appellant made his escape good. The matter was reported by the
complainant to the local police at Police Station Sabir Abad, which
was penned down in the shape of F.LR Ex:PA dated 09.02.2017
under section 302 PPC.

5. . The learned counsel representing the accused/

appellant submitted that presence of the complainant has not been
established and that the FIR was lodged with a considerable delay
after consultation and deliberation and that the witnesses were
interested to falsely implicate the accused/appellant in the case. He
lastly contended that the prosecution could not establish the
charges against the appellant, through independent and
disinterested witnesses.

6. This is on record that the incident occurred at 10.49
hours, whereas the matter was reported to the local police at 13.00
hours, i.e. after a delay of 2 hours. The distance between the spot
and Police Station Sabir Abad, is given as 7/8 kilometres. Now this
Court has to see, as to whether the incident occurred at the place, in
the manner and at the time and as to whether the complainant and
PW Gul Shaheed were present with the deceased. In the FIR it was
stated that the complainant alongwith the deceased had gone to the
spot baithak in order to see the grandson of PW-07, who happened
to be a councillor and such was the status of the deceased. The
story narrated by the complainant depicts that the purpose was only
and only to see the grandson of PW Gul Shaheed as the deceased
had some personal work, the complainant and deceased reached to
the spot baithak, where they met PW-07 and took their seats on the
ground, the anxiety of this Court increased that if the purpose was
to see the grandson of the eye-witness then why it was not
demanded and that why PW Gul Shaheed did not call for his

grandson. Throughout the episode, the said grandson of the PW-07

did not come to surface and even afterwards nothing was heard of
him. PW-07, owned the spot baithak, which was comprising of
three rooms and a courtyard, but surprisingly the deceased and the
complainant were not shown in and even no cot and chair was
offered to sit being guests. The complainant did not state, while
reporting the matter to the police, that their sole purpose was to see
the grandson of PW Gul Shaheed, but it was later on when the
complainant appeared as PW-05 he improved his version and stated
that the deceased was to see the grandson of PW-07. This witness
was asked time and again as to what was the specific purpose of
such meeting, he astonished us to say that the purpose was known
to the deceased who did not share the same, he was further asked as
to whether the complainant and the grandson of the witness were
known to each other, he replied that he did not know. The parties
belonging to the same village and the interse distance between the
house of the complainant and the spot is one kilometre so it is
beyond understanding that how the complainant and the grandson
of PW-07 were not known to each other. The site plan depicts the
places of the deceased, complainant, the eye-witness and the
accused. The interse distances among the three has been shown as
11-feet and above, if the stance of the complainant was taken to be
correct that they were engaged in gossip then all the three should
have been in closer proximity rather than sitting 12-feet apart.

Furthermore the age of PW-07 was given as 69/70 years which
questions the close intimacy between the complainant, deceased
and him. The accused/ appellant was shown at point No.4 who
fired from a distance of 12-feet on the deceased and the deceased
received five inlet wounds where injuries No.2 and 5 were caused
from the back, whereas one of the injury was having blackening
around, if the statement of the witnesses is taken to be correct then,
we are confronted with a situation that how the two entry wounds
were received from the back, when the assailant and deceased were
facing each other and that how blackening could be caused from a
distance of 12-feet, but the prosecution failed to answer.

In case titled, “Amin Ali and another Vs _the State”

(2011 SCMR 323) wherein it is held that:
“All the three witnesses deposed that the
deceased had received three injuries, but
the Medical Officer found six injuries on
the person of the deceased. One of them
had blackening. None of the witnesses
deposed that any of the appellants had
caused the injuries from a close range,
but on the contrary in the site plan the
place of firing has been shown 8-feet
away from the deceased. Thus from such
a distance injury with blackening cannot

be caused, as it can be caused from a
distance of less than three feet as per
Modi’s medical jurisprudence.”
7. This Court is anxious to know that why only the
deceased was targeted, as the motive was against one Umar
Saddique, another brother of the deceased and if so than both the
brothers should have been the targets. It is an element of surprise
that when the deceased and complainant were empty handed, why
the complainant was left unhurt, as he too was within the firing
range. The time of occurrence has been given as 10.49 hours
whereas the matter was reported at 13.00 hours, despite the fact that
the spot and the Police Station are lying at a distance of 7/8
kilometres, after realizing the fact that if the delay is not explained,
it would cost a lot, so an attempt was made to explain the same.
The complainant explained the delay that initially it took 30-
minutes to arrange a Dotson and thereafter the dead-body was
taken to KDA Hospital Karak, where they spent 20/40 minutes as
the deceased was examined by the doctor, he further stated that the
police was not present in the hospital, so they were advised to shift
the deceased to the Police Station, which they did accordingly. It
was the prosecution to convince this Court through its evidence that
the delay caused was not for consultation and deliberation. The
statements of both the witnesses that is the complainant and the
eye-witness are worth perusal, PW-07 admitted in his cross-

examination that he owned a tractor and a Dotson during the days

of occurrence but he did not say that as the Dotson was not
available so they made efforts to arrange another and that it took
30-minutes, the explanation does not end here he kept on going to
say that the dead-body was initially taken to KDA hospital Karak,
where they spent 20/40 minutes and after examination by the
doctor they approached the Police Station, as according to this
witness none from the police was present in the hospital to scribe
the report. The complainant while reporting the matter to the police
stated that after receiving the fire shot the deceased died on the spot,
if so, why the dead-body was taken to the hospital, instead of
Police Station Sabir Abad, which falls in the way, even otherwise
the KDA hospital Karak has its own reporting center where the
police officials are present round the clock, with the only purpose
to enter such cases. We are surprised that how the doctor could
examine the dead-body when no report is made. There is no entry
on record to suggest that in fact the deceased was taken to KDA
hospital and that he was examined by the doctor nor the doctor who
allegedly examined the dead-body finds mention on the record, so
the explanation tendered leads us nowhere but to hold that the
presence of the complainant on the spot and later on in the hospital

has not been established.

In case titled “Muhammad Wasif Khan and others Vs
The State and others” (2011 PCr.L J 470 Lahore) it is

held that:-

“F.LR. has a very significant role to

play, being a corner stone of the

prosecution case to establish guilt of the

accused involved in the crime-- Any

doubt in lodging of FIR. and

commencement of investigation give

rise to a benefit in favour of accused--

F.LR. lodged after conducting an

inquiry loses its evidentiary value.”
8. The report was made to one Nazir Badshah ASI, (PW-
09) by the complainant who also prepared the injury sheet and
inquest report. This witness when appeared before the Court as
PW-09, stated that he prepared the injury sheet, inquest report and
thereafter dispatched the dead-body under the escort of one Qismat
Ali constable to RHC Sabir Abad. This witness frankly admitted
that he did not mention the nature of injuries in the injury sheet, he
further stated that he did not mention the F.I.R number and section
of law in the inquest report. If it was PW-09, who scribed the report
and prepared the injury sheet and inquest report then why the
inquest report did not find mention of the section of law and F.LR
number, it indicates that initially the injury sheet and inquest report
was prepared and it was than when the complainant reached to the
Police Station the report was recorded. In the inquest report the

nature of blood was mentioned as fresh (Raqeeq) which further
10

disputed the time of incident as it was after two hours of the
occurrence the report was made so for long two hours, the blood
cannot remain fresh (Rageeq) rather it clots (Munjamind). This
deliberate attempt on part of the prosecution witnesses caused
serious dents to the prosecution case and it also questions the
presence of the complainant at the time of occurrence with the
deceased and that these were co-villagers, who brought the dead-
body to the Police Station and later on, on receiving information
regarding the occurrence and dispatch of the dead-body to the
Police Station the complainant alongwith others reached there,
which indicates nothing but to hold that it was a case of preliminary
investigation. Qismatullah PW-03, escorted the dead-body from the
Police Station to RHC Sabir Abad for post mortem examination.
PW-01, Disfaraz alongwith one Khalid Usman were present in the
hospital, who identified the dead-body before the doctor. Difaraz
happens to be the brother of the deceased, who was examined as
PW-01, who stated that on the day of occurrence he left for Sabir
Abad to purchase vegetable where he felt unwell so he went to the
hospital to consult a doctor and that it was after some time that the
dead-body was brought to the hospital. This witness categorically
stated that he was not in possession of the mobile phone as it was
left at home. He further stated that he received information
regarding the occurrence and arrival of the dead-body to the

hospital, despite the fact that he was not in possession of the mobile
il

phone he received information but failed to explain that what was
the source of his knowledge, regarding the occurrence and arrival
of the dead-body to RHC Sabir Abad. What a coincident this was
that he reaches the hospital a little before the dead-body was
brought. The reaching of PW-01 to the hospital suggests that he got
information in his village wherefrom he alongwith Moiz, Khalid
Uand Usman and the complainant reached to the hospital and
reported the matter.

9. The conduct of the complainant is not above board as
he stated that after reporting the matter he went to his house and so
did PW Gul Shaheed, what abnormality this was that a brother
leaves for home when the dead-body of his real brother still lies
before the doctor. Yar Muhammad ASI, the Investigating Officer
was examined as PW-08, he stated that it was 01.40/01.45 p.m that
he reached to the spot and on pointation of the complainant and
PW-07 the recoveries were made and the site plan was prepared.
The Investigating Officer stated that he alongwith PWs remained
on the spot for two to three hours, whereas the dead-body was
handed over to the legal heirs at 15.50 hours in the hospital and it is
still a mystery to resolve that whether the legal heirs were present
with the Investigating Officer as he stated or they were in the
hospital to receive the dead-body, this creates dents in the
prosecution case regarding the availability of the witnesses on the

spot with the Investigating Officer. Though stress was given that a

Vv

12

single accused has been charged and that substitution in case of
single accused is a rear phenomena, true but the prosecution has
never been absolved from its liability to prove the case beyond the
shadow of reasonable doubt. The Court while dealing with the case
of a single accused has to take great care and caution and to judge
the available evidence coupled with circumstances of the case and
if it comes to the conclusion that the witnesses were interested or
chance witnesses then the concept of single accused and his
substitution should not be a clog in the way to acquittal. In case in
hand the witnesses went on abnormal improvements and _ the
behavior shown has caused greater dents to the case and in such
eventuality we are left with no option but to hold that the
prosecution has failed to bring home charges against the appellant.

Reliance is placed on case titled, “Bashir Ahmad alias

Mannu_Vs_The_ State” (NLR 1996 criminal 234) and
“Muhammad Irshad and another Vs_the State (1999 SCMR
1030), wherein it is held that:

“The eye-witness examined by the
prosecution are closely related to one
and other and the rule of prudence
required that there should have been
some independent corroboration
available for placing implicit reliance
on their testimony but the same is
lacking and it would be highly unsafe

to act upon the  uncorroborated
13

testimony of eye-witnesses examined by
the prosecution, particularly when it is
full of material contradictions. It is in
conflict with the medical evidence, also
with regard to the distance from which
the deceased and the injured P.Ws
were reportedly fired at. The deceased
and the eye-witnesses were not persons
of good antecedents as apparent from
record, showing them involved in

several criminal cases.

10. The Investigating Officer was examined as PW-08,
who stated that he was provided with the copy of F.I.R in Police
Station and he alongwith other police officials reached to the spot,
though the complainant stated that he came to the spot alongwith
police from the Police Station but neither the Investigating Officer
confirmed his statement nor PW-02 Tahir Ayub deposed in this
respect. The venue of occurrence was disputed by the learned
counsel for the defence and our attention was brought to the
contradictions in the statements of the Investigating Officer and the
eye-witnesses. PW-07, stated that the accused / appellant appeared
and started firing on the deceased and that in all 24 fire shots were
made where 13/14 hit the walls of the baithak whereas six fire shots
were stuck in the ground, the Investigating Officer when appeared
before the Court.he did not utter a single word in this respect and

he admitted that neither he mentioned the bullet marks on the
14

surrounding walls nor recovered spent bullets there from. Some
photographs were placed on file, which were created by the
Investigating Officer at the time of spot inspection and these
photographs show heaps of gravel and sand on the places where the
witnesses and the deceased were sitting and in presence of the
debris it was not only hard but impossible to sit thereon. The house
of the complainant and the spot was stated to be one kilometer
apart and there was every possibility that the complainant and other
witnesses attracted after the occurrence. The recovered empties
were sent to FSL on 09.02.2017, whereas these were received on
15.02.2017, but nothing was brought on record that where these
empties were lying in the intervening period neither the Moharrir of
the Police Station was examined nor abstract from register number
19 was collected. PW-02 Tahir Ayub was examined, who was the
person per investigating officer to have taken the empties to the
Forensic Science Laboratory, who appeared before the Court stated
in respect of other facts, but remained silent of his taking the
empties to the Laboratory for chemical examination, his this silence
destroy the evidentiary value of the empties and its report.

11. One Moiz who identified the deceased before the
police at the time of report and also verified the report of the
complainant was not produced, the non-production of this witness

tells otherwise, that had he been produced he would have not
15

supported the stance of the complainant and Article 129 (g) of the

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 caters for the situation.

Inc case of “Tahir Khan Vs. The State, (2011 SCMR

646), the Hon’ble Supreme Court affirmed this view in the
following words:

“13. In the present case as observed above, the
clouds over the veracity of the prosecution version
began hovering with the substitution of the initially
nominated persons in the F.I.R. and also that
complainant did not appear as a witness. It
assumes relevance as he (Ghulam Hussain) Sultan
Mehmood and Ghulam Abbas were given up by the
prosecution and not produced. The only possible
conclusion is that the prosecution sensed the risk of
producing them that they might not support the
said version. Their production thus was withheld

leaving doubts spreading all around.”

12. The motive was stated to be a dispute over women
folk, but the complainant did not specify that who out of the
brothers was connected with. It was later on when the complainant
stated that the motive was against his other brother, namely, Umer
Sadique. The Investigating Officer did not collect anything in this
respect nor the statement of any independent person was recorded
and when he was questioned in this respect he frankly conceded

that nothing was brought on record in black and white in this
16

respect. If the statement of the complainant to the extent of motive
is taken to be correct then we are failed to understand that why the
deceased was selected and why the complainant was left scot free
where the accused could have easily killed both the brothers that
too when they were at his mercy being empty handed. Thus, the

prosecution has failed to prove the motive, it has been held in case

of “Muhammad Sadiq Vs__Muhammad_ Server” (1997_SCMR

214) that when motive is alleged, but not proved then the ocular

evidence is required to be scrutinized with great caution in case

“Hakim Ali Vs the State (1971 SCMR 432) it has been held that

the prosecution though not called upon to establish motive in every
case, yet once it has set up a motive and failed to establish it, the
prosecution must suffer consequence and not the defence.

In case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias acchu_Vs

eee

the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity between
the parties and has also given details of the
same in his statement recorded before the
trial court. No doubt, previous enmity can be
a reason for the appellant to commit the
alleged crime, but it can equally be a reason
for the complainant side to falsely implicate
the appellant in this case for previous

grouse.”
17

13. The learned counsel representing the respondents /
complainant stressed that the accused remained absconder for a
sufficient long time and to him the abscondence is an urging
factor to hold that the accused was responsible for commission
of the offence, but we failed to understand that how
abscondence can alone be taken into account when the
prosecution failed to establish its case. There is no cavil to the
preposition that abscondence alone cannot be a substitute, of
the direct evidence and this aspect has been beautifully dealt

with by the apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs

the State” (2017 SCMR 144), wherein it is held that:

“The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be
made sole basis for his conviction when
the other evidence of the prosecution is
doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”
14. Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to
convince this court that it was non-else but accused who killed

the deceased.

15. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against

accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed,

18

UU
the conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the
learned trial court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge
by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth
with from jail, if not required to be detained in connection with
any other case, Whereas the Murder Reference No.2-B of 2019,

is answered in negative.

Above are the reasons of our short order of the even date.
