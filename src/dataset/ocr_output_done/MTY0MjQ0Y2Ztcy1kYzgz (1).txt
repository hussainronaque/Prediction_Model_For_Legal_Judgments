Criminal Bail Application No.S-41 of 2022

DATE ORDER WITH SIGNATURE OF JUDGE

15.04.2022

Mr. Shah Nawaz Bughio, Advocate for the applicant.
Mr. Muhammad Humayoon Khan, D.A.G for Pakistan.

Irshad Ali Shah J;- It is alleged that the applicant with rest of the
culprits misappropriated public money in millions of rupees by making
false record with regard to sell of Coal at Lakhra Coal Mining Project

Hyderabad, for that the present case was registered.

2. On having been refused bail by learned Special Judge
Anticorruption (Central) Hyderabad, the applicant has sought for the
same from this Court by way of the instant bail application under
section 497 Cr.P.C.

3. It is contended by learned counsel for the applicant that the
applicant being innocent has been involved in this case falsely by the
police; the F.I.R of the incident has been lodged with delay of about
three years; it does not contain the name of the applicant and offence
alleged against him is not falling within prohibitory clause, therefore, he
is entitled to his release on bail on point of further inquiry. In support of
his contentions, he relied upon the case of Naeem Khan Vs. The State and
others [2022 SCMR 419].

4. Learned Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan, who is assisted by

Investigating Officer of the case has opposed to release of the applicant
on bail by contending that he has misappropriated millions of rupees by
making fake entries in record with regard to sell of Coal at Lakhra Coal
Mine.

5. Heard arguments and perused the record.

6. Admittedly the applicant was Assistant Manager Accounts at
Lakhra Coal Mine and he was holding the charge of Project Manager at
the time when co-accused Niaz Akhtar was on Ex-Pakistan leave and
during such period he issued false receipts and indents with regard to
sell of Coal and by such act, caused loss to Pakistan Mineral Corporation
to the extent of Rs.20,65,335/-. It is true that the name of the applicant
is not transpiring in F.I.R but there is no denial to the fact that it was
disclosed subsequently on investigation of the case with ample
evidence, which prima facie connect him with commission of incident.
In that situation, it would be premature to say that the applicant being
innocent has been involved in this case falsely by the police. No
justification is advanced by the applicant, which may suggest that the
police was having ill-will or ulterior motive to involve him in this case
falsely. The F.I.R of the incident has been lodged on noticing the
misappropriation of public money; therefore, the delay in lodgment of
F.I.R in such like case could hardly be made a reason to order release of
the applicant on bail. It is true that the offence alleged against the
applicant is not falling within prohibitory clause but it certainly is falling
within exceptional clause for the reason that it is involving the
misappropriation of public money to large scale. The deeper

appreciation of facts and circumstances even otherwise is not
permissible at bail stage. There appear reasonable grounds to believe
that the applicant is guilty of the offence with which he is charged.

7. The case law which is relied upon by learned counsel for the
applicant is on distinguishable facts and circumstances. In that case the
investigating officer was fair enough to say that there is no documentary
evidence against the applicant, which is not the case in hand.

8. In view of above, it is concluded safely that no case for release of
the applicant on bail is made out, consequently instant bail application
is dismissed with directions to learned Trial Court to dispose of the very
case against the applicant within two months after receipt of copy of
this order.
