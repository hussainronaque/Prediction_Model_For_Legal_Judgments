QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J-. This single

judgment in the instant appeal is also directed
to dispose of the connected criminal appeal No.

197-P/2014 titled "Aziz-ur-Rehman vs __the

State", as both the instant appeal as well as
afore-mentioned connected appeal arise out of
the same case vide FIR No. 30 dated
25.01.2011 under sections 302/324/34 PPC

police station Nizampur; and both the criminal
appeals are also directed against the same
judgment/order of learned Sessions Judge,

Nowshera, dated 17.03.2014.

2. The case/FIR was registered on the
report of Shakir Khan son of Qadir Khan
resident of Jabi, Nizampur, in DHQ hospital
Nowshera Kalan, who was brought alongwith
deceased, Muhammad Mujahid son of
Muhammad Sadiq, by his relatives and reported
to the police at 11:00 hours on 25.01.2011 to
the effect that earlier at 9:50 hours he alongwith
his cousin Muhammad Mujahid and other
relatives was proceeding towards the river for
working there as laborers and when reached
Jabba Khwar, Nizampur, at 9:50 hours, they

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
injuries while on his way to the hospital. The
occurrence was reportedly witnessed by
relatives of the complainant namely Faisal son
of Aslam Khan and Akhtar Amin; while motive
for the occurrence was cited altercation
between the accused and victims one day prior
to the occurrence. In his report, the complainant
charged all the four (4) accused mentioned in
the FIR. The report/FIR was also verified by
relative of the deceased and complainant,
namely, Akhtar Amin, who thumb impressed
the Murasila, like the complainant, drafted by
Thsan-ur-Rehman SI (PW-11). On the basis of
Murasila (Ex. PW-8/1), case/FIR (Ex. PA) was
registered; and both the deceased and the
injured were referred for postmortem and
medical examinations, respectively, to the

Medical Officer.

3. The postmortem examination of
deceased, Muhammad Mujahid, revealed the
following wounds:-

1) Stab wound right sternal border at the

level of 5th intercastle space I 1/2
inch long.

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
2) Stab wound left sternal border about
O1 inch above the wound# I and 01
inch long.

3) Stab wound right hypocondrum 1 1/2

7) Stab wound just above right iliac wrist
about 2 inches long, skull and muscle
deeply cut-down.”

The time between injury and death was shown

instantaneous; and duration between death and

postmortem as 04 to 05 hours.

4. The same Medical Officer (PW-10)
also examined the injured/complainant, Shakir
Khan, and found two stab wounds, one at left
nipple about 3 inches long, skin and muscle cut
down and the other at left sternal border about
01 inch long, skin and muscles cut down.

5. The investigation in the case was
entrusted to Bashir Ahmed, SI/OII (PW-2), who

proceeded to the spot, inspected the spot, and

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
prepared site plan (Ex. PW-2/1). During spot
inspection, the Investigating Officer secured
bloodstained sand from the place assigned in
the site plan to deceased, Muhammad Mujahid,
and the same alongwith bloodstained garments
sent by the Medical Officer after postmortem
examination was dispatched to the Forensic
Science Laboratory, Peshawar, wherefrom,
positive result was received. Likewise,
bloodstained sand collected from the place
assigned to the injured/complainant in the site
plan was sent alongwith his shirt, and result in
this respect was also received from the FSL in
the affirmative. All the four (4) accused named
in the FIR remained at large, and were
proceeded under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C
and challan was submitted against them under
section 512 Cr.P.C, leading to recording of
statements of 3 PWs; and order of the learned
Judicial Magistrate, Nowshera, dated
25.06.2011, whereby, all the four (4) accused
were declared proclaimed offenders and
perpetual warrants of arrest were issued against
them. The appellants, Imran and Aziz-ur-

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
Rehman, were arrested from Karachi on
08.06.2011. They were shifted from Karachi,
and a joint complete/supplementary challan
were submitted against them; but, later on,
separate challan was submitted against
appellant, Aziz-ur-Rehman, under the Juvenile
Justice System Ordinance, 2000. They were
separately tried, after separate formal charges
were framed against them; firstly, under
sections 302/34 PPC, secondly, under sections
324/34 PPC, thirdly, under sections 337-F
(ii)/34 PPC, and, fourthly, also under sections
337-F = (4i)/34 += PPC, ~=to which, _ the
accused/appellants pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

6. During separate trials, the prosecution
produced the following 11 PWs, namely:-

e Jehanzeb Khan, HC # 440 (PW-1) was
entrusted with warrants of arrest against
absconding accused under section 204
and also proclamation under section 87

Cr.P.C against them;

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
Bashir Ahmad SI/OI (PW-2) was
entrusted with investigation of the case,
and he accordingly conducted
investigation;

Kamran Khan SHO (PW-3) submitted
supplementary challan against
accused/appellants, Imran and Aziz-ur-
Rehman;

Alamzeb Khan SI (PW-4) arrested both
the accused/Appellants, Imran and Aziz-
ur-Rehman, from Karachi and conducted
proceedings of their shifting from

marginal witness to recovery memos
pertaining to recoveries of bloodstained
sand from the spot and bloodstained
garments taken into possession by the
Investigating Officer;

Subhanullah, ASI, (PW-6), registered
case/FIR (Ex. PA) on the receipt of

Murasila;

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
7.

Naseem Khan SI, (PW-7), submitted
challan under section 512 Cr.P.C against
the absconding accused;

Shakir (PW-8), complainant in the case,
and his report was incorporated in the
Murasila (Ex. PW-8/1);

Akhtar Amin (PW-9), the eyewitness
mentioned in the FIR, and he also
verified report of the complainant;

Dr. Muhammad Younas Khan Khattak
(PW-10), the Medical Officer, who
conducted postmortem examination of
deceased, Muhammad Mujahid, and also
medically examined the
injured/complainant, Shakirullah; and
Thsan-ur-Rehman SI (PW-11) drafted
Murasila (Ex. PW-8/1) on the report of

the complainant.

After prosecution closed its evidence,

statements of both the accused/appellants were

recorded. They refuted allegations of the

prosecution, but declined to be examined on

oath or produce defence evidence. On

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
conclusion of trial, the accused/Appellants were
found guilty of the charges levelled against
them, and convicted under section 302 (b)
PPC, and sentenced to life imprisonment and
also held liable to compensation of Rs. 50,000/-
to all the legal heirs of the deceased or in
default thereof to further 6 months SI. The
accused/appellants were also convicted under
section 324 PPC and sentenced to 5 years RI.
The accused/appellants were further convicted
under section 337 F (ii) PPC and sentenced to
one year RI and payment of Daman of Rs.
30,000/- to complainant and in case of non-
payment of Daman, the accused/appellants
were to be kept in jail in simple imprisonment
till payment of Daman. In separate judgments
dated 17.03.2017, the learned Sessions
Judge/Judge Special Court directed that all the
sentences. shall run concurrently, while
extending benefit of section 382 (B) Cr.P.C to
the accused/appellant. Through — separate
criminal appeals, the appellants assailed the
judgment dated 17.03.2014, and also their
conviction and sentences awarded to them.

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
8. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convicts/appellants and learned A.A.G
appearing on behalf of the State assisted by
leaned counsel for the complainant heard; and
record perused.

9. No doubt, complainant in the case,
Shakir Khan, carried stamp of injuries on his
person, but mere presence of injuries on his
person would neither make him a truthful
witness nor his testimony sufficient to result in
conviction of accused, unless his deposition
was consistent with and corroborated by other
ocular and circumstantial evidence, which was
lacking in’ the case. The complainant had
thumb impressed the murasila, drafted on his
report, and PW Akhtar Amin also thumb
impressed the murasila; but when the
complainant appeared as PW.8, he stated in his
statement before the Court that he had signed
his report/murasila in English. Likewise,
Akhtar Amin (PW9) stated that he did not
remember as to whether his “thumb impression

was obtained upon the report or not”. The

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
11

complainant, Shakir, stated that PWs Akhtar
Amin and Faisal had also signed the murasila;
but the murasila bears the thumb impression
of only one so-called eye witness, Akhtar
Amin, besides thumb impression of the
complainant. The lodging of report and drafting
of murasila on the report of the complainant in
the DHQ hospital, Nowshera Kalan, after
delay of one hour and 10 minutes inspite of
police post, Sabir Abad, situated on main road
from village Jabai to Nowshera would certainly
raise question about possibility of prior
consultation and deliberation before lodging

the report/FIR.

10. All the four accused named in the
FIR, being members of the same family,
accused Imran and Naeem real brothers inter-se
and sons of Asif Khan and Shafiq-ur-Rhman
and Aziz-ur-Rehman also real brothers inter-se
and sons of Naimat Khan, were charged for
causing dagger “(Churri)” blows to the deceased

and the complainant; but complainant Shakir

(PW8) improved his statement in this regard by

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
12

saying that he was attacked and assaulted by
Imran and Naeem whereas deceased was hit by
Shafi-ur-Rehman and Aziz-ur-Rhman.

11. Apart from the fact that Akhtar Amin
(PW9) claiming to be an eye witness, did not
receive a single injury despite alleged sudden
attack by four accused having daggers (Churri)
in their possession, their assemblage at the
place of occurrence from different locations
where they were residing, while proceeding
towards the river, which has not been shown in
the site plan, is not finding any explanation
from the record. In the site plan, the place of
occurrence has been shown as Jabai ‘Khawar’,
and deceased, complainant and the so-called
eye witnesses were shown proceeding from
western side towards river situated on the
eastern side; but neither houses of the
complainant party have been shown on the
western side nor their destination i.e. river
shown on the eastern side. It may be added
here that the I.O showed the site plan prepared
on the pointation of the eye witnesses; but the
eye witness, Akhtar Amin (PW9), categorically

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
13

stated in his statement before the Court that ‘the
site plan was not prepared at his instance,
rather the same was prepared on the instance of
PW Faisal’, who was not produced as a witness
by the prosecution. The site plan was
admittedly not prepared on the pointation of
the complainant, Shakir; thus, in other words,
the site plan was not corroborated through the
testimony of the eye witnesses, on whose
alleged pointation the same was prepared by
the IO. Intriguingly, both the deceased and
injured complainant had been shown side by
side with each other in the site plan; but witness
to the recovery memo (EXPW2/2 and
EXPW2/3) i.e. Razifat Shah FC No.1239
(PWS) stated in his statement before the Court
that “the blood stained sand was recovered

from the six paces from each other’.

12. Needless to say that both the eye
witnesses mentioned in the FIR, namely, Faisal
and Akhtar Amin were, admittedly, closely
related to the deceased and the injured

complainant, who were also related inter-se,

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
14

therefore, not only the injured complainant but
also both the eye witnesses mentioned in the
FIR were interested witnesses, being closely
related to each other. Although, scribe of the
murasila, Thsan-ur-Rehman SI (PW11), stated
in his statement before the Court that in the
report of the complainant other relatives of the
complainant were also shown present along
with the complainant while they were
proceeding towards river side, however, their
names had not been mentioned as eye
witnesses of the occurrence; and that the
deceased and the injured complainant were
also accompanied by many persons of the
locality when they were brought to the hospital;
but none of them were cited as PWs to lend

credence to the version of the prosecution.

13. The motive for the occurrence was
mentioned as altercation with the accused one
day prior to the occurrence, but apart from
absence of anything on record regarding
altercation between the accused and unspecified
member (s) of the complainant party one day

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
15

prior to the occurrence, the reason for previous
altercation also remained a matter of
speculation. As such, the alleged motive was
not proved, rather negated by the complainant
(PW8) by saying that “there was no quarrel at
all with the accused party prior to the instant
occurrence”. Undoubtedly, motive is not an
essential pre-requisite for proof of a criminal
case, but once alleged in a case, it becomes
incumbent upon the prosecution to prove the
same, otherwise, the lack of proof can cause

considerable damage to the prosecution case.

14. There is, indeed, another intriguing
aspect of the case of showing no resistance
either by deceased, Mujahid, or by the injured-
complainant, Shakir Khan, and other two eye
witnesses, who escaped unhurt, although not
only the deceased received seven stab wounds
and the injured complainant also received two
stab wounds, but the accused were shown in
possession of daggers (Churri), without being
armed with any firearm; and the deceased,

complainant and the eye witnesses not making

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
16

even an attempt to run away from the scene of
occurrence despite having seen the accused
from a distance of 5/6 paces sitting there having
in their possession daggers (churri). At least,
the deceased and the injured-complainant have
been shown standing like statues and receiving
daggers (churri) blows on their bodies, without
showing any re-action and resistance; and the
eye witnesses also showing no
reaction/resistance, according to the FIR; but
improved their statements in this regard by
deposing that they had tried to rescue the
deceased and injured-complainant and stopped
the accused from fatal dagger (churri) attacks,
but they failed as the situation was out of their
control. Their testimony in this respect all along
remained inconsistent because despite
complainant (PW8) showing Muhammad
Akhtar Amin and Faisal PW trying to rescue
them in his examination-in-chief, contradicted
himself by saying “ that PW Faisal and Akhtar
Amin did not come near to them as the accused
were also attempting at their lives as well”; and
Akhtar Amin (PW9) stated that no attempt was

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
17

made by the accused at them at the time of
scuffle and further that “neither PW Faisal nor
PW Akhtar Amin had separated any one of the
accused from us”. Even this improvement in
their statements did not receive any support
from the record, as neither any injury had been
shown to have been received by them during
their alleged struggle to rescue the deceased
and injured-complainant and stop the accused
from the daggers (churri) attack, nor their
clothes were found stained with blood either
during their said alleged attempt or when they
were removing the deceased, then seriously
injured, and the injured-complainant to the

hospital.

15. The postmortem report also appeared
in conflict with the FIR, by showing time
between injury and death as ‘instantaneous’;
whereas the FIR lodged by the complainant
showed deceased, Mujahid, succumbing to the
injuries on his way to the hospital. The
statement of Medical Officer (PW10), showing

the possibility of injuries on both the deceased

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
18

and the injured caused by Axe would make the
FIR showing all the injuries caused by dagger
(Churri) more doubtful.

16. The above stated discrepancies,
contradictions and improvement, in the case of
the prosecution created seriuous doubts in the
case, benefit of which must have been extended
to the accused. Although, there was much focus
on abscondence of the appellants for
considerable time, but their arrest from Karachi,
statement of Bashir Ahmad S.I (PW2) showing
the accused facing trial/appellant, residing at
Karachi and not at village Jabai, and also
statement of Jehanzeb Khan HC (PW1)
admitting the factum of non-preparation of
sketch of houses of the accused and no private
person accompanying him at the spot at the
time of pointation inspite of his admission of
the fact that many people were attracted to the
spot from the surrounding houses at the time
of pointation but they were not made witnesses
to the pointation proceedings, and further that
no pointation whatsoever had been made by the
accused in his presence and that he had signed

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
19

the pointation memo inside the Police Station,
would not only make abscondence of the
appellants bereft of any evidentiary value for
the case of the prosecution; but would also
render the pointation memo (EXPWI/9), to
which Jehanzeb Khan, HC No.440 (PW1) is
also marginal witness besides being enterested
with warrants of arrest against the accused, not
worthy of any evidentiary value, which was
even otherwise not admissible in evidence in
the absence of any recovery/discovery as a
result of alleged pointation by the
accused/appellants. Likewise, abscondence of
the accused/appellants, per-se, without being
supported by corroborative ocular and
circumstantial evidence, could not bring home
charge against the accused/appellants.

17. There was, as such, no incriminating
evidence on the record to make the
accused/appellants liable to conviction and
sentences awarded to them. Therefore, both the
appeals of Imran (Cr.A No.196-P/2014) and
that of Juvenile Aziz-ur-Rehman (Cr.A No.197-
P/2014) are accepted; and impugned judgments

(D.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Lal Jan Khattak
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Qalandar Ali Khan
20

dated 17.03.2014, together with conviction of
the appellants and sentences awarded to them,
are set aside; and the accused/appellants are
acquitted of the charges. They be set free,
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

Announced.
