SYED MUHAMAMD ATTIQUE SHAH, J:-

Petitioners, through instant petition have
approached this Court for setting aside the
impugned orders passed by the learned lower

Courts below with the following prayer:

“It is humbly prayed that the
judgments and orders of both the
Courts below may graciously be set
aside.”

2. Brief and essential facts leading
to institution of instant revision petition are,
that a case under Section 365-B/34 PPC was
registered on report of one Syed Muzaffar Shah
regarding abuduction of his wife, Mst. Chand

Bibi vide F.I-R No.81 dated 03.07.2013 in PS
Phulra. After recovery, the said Mst. Chand
Bibi in her statement recorded under section
164 Cr.P.C before Judicial Magistrate-III,
Mansehra, showed her willingness to go with
her paternal cousin, namely, Syed Asghar Shah,
(petitioner No.1); learned Judicial Magistrate,
Mansehra allowed her to go with petitioner
No.1, subject to his furnishing of personal bond
in the sum of Rs.500,000/- to the satisfaction of
SHO/I.O concerned, to ensure safety and
security of Mst. Chand Bibi and to produce her
before any Court as and when _ required;
petitioners submitted requisite surety bonds in
Court of learned Judicial Magistrate and she
was handed over to _ petitioner No.1;
subsequently, she was murdered by her
husband, Syed Muzaffar Shah and case was
registered against him; later on, learned Judicial
Magistrate-II], Mansehra forfeited the bond
submitted by the petitioners vide order dated
26.10.2013 and show cause notices dated

10.01.2014 were served upon them, who
submitted their written reply thereto on
18.01.2014 and consequently, the petitioners
were directed by learned Judicial Magistrate to
deposit one third(1/3™) portion of the amount
i.e. Rs.166,666.66/- each, vide order dated
14.03.2015; that the petitioners filed a revision
petition against the said order, which was
dismissed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Mansehra vide order dated
08.06.2015. Hence, the present petition
before this Court.

4. Learned AAG appearing for State,
at the very outset of proceedings, has objected
to the maintainability of present revision
petition and stated that petitioners have already
exhausted the remedy of revision before the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Mansehra, therefore, the present Revision
Petition is not maintainable; further stated that
impugned orders of learned Courts below are
the result of proper appreciation of material

available on record of the case and both the
learned Courts below have not committed any
illegality or irregularity in exercise of their
jurisdiction

5. Learned counsel for petitioners
while rebutting arguments on question of
maintainability stated that this Court has ample
power to convert present Criminal Revision
Petition into a quashment petition under section
561-A Cr.P.C in the larger interest of justice,
and in this respect placed reliance on case
reported as Muhammad Akhtar Vs. The
State (1993 MLD 370).

On merits of the case, learned
counsel for petitioners argued that the
impugned orders of the learned lower Courts
below are illegal and have been passed against
the material available on record of the case,
thus the same are not sustainable in the eye of
law, further urged that the same are also
violative of the true spirit of section 514
Cr.P.C, further submitted that the petitioners

stood sureties and furnished surety bonds on
humanitarian grounds without any
consideration or financial gain/benefits out of
the same and prayed for setting aside of the
impugned orders of lower Courts below.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for
petitioners and learned AAG heard and record
perused with their able assistance.

7. So far as the maintainability of
the petition in hand is concerned, this Court in
view of case law cited at the bar convert the
present criminal revision petition into a petition
under section 561-A Cr.P.C for its disposal on
merits in the larger interest of justice. Office is
directed to make necessary entries in the
relevant record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that
petitioners stood sureties for safety and security
of Mst. Chand Bibi and in this respect they
furnished personal surety bonds before the
Court, however, later on they failed to
discharge their legal obligation for which they

stood sureties. As the petitioners stood sureties
for safety and security through their own sweet
will, therefore, it was mandatory upon them to
discharge their said obligations and duties
diligently but they miserably failed to do so.
Had there been any issues regarding her safety
and security, then they should have applied to
the Court concerned for discharge of their
surety bonds under the law. Moreover, their
replies to the show cause notices are worth
perusal in which they have clearly stated that
they have allowed her to go to her home where
she was murdered by her husband. In view of
above stated facts, it becomes crystal clear that
petitioners have miserably failed in
performance of their legal obligations/duties
which they willingly accepted by submitting
surety bonds, therefore, in the given
circumstances of the case in hand, they cannot
be absolved from their responsibilities as due to
their irresponsible attitude and uncalled for
conduct, an innocent human being lost her life.

The learned Courts below while imposing
penalty upon the petitioners has taken a very
lenient view. Thus, in view of peculiar facts
and circumstances of the present case, it is held
that the findings rendered by both the Courts
below are based on proper appreciation of
material available on record of the case, and the
law applicable thereto, thus warranting no
interference by this Court in its jurisdiction
under section 561-A Cr.P.C.

9. Keeping in view the above referred
reasons and discussion made thereupon, this

petition being devoid of any substance is

dismissed.
