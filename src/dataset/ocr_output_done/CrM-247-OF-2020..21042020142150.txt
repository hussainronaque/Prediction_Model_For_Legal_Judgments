JUDGMENT

a
AHMAD ALI, J. Petitioners (Dora S/o Nosher,
Hussain S/o Siraj, Satbar S/o Doraj and Ajdar S/o
Doraj) through the instant petition, have prayed for
their post arrest bail in case FIR No. 247 dated
18.12.2019 u/s 302/311/148/149 PPC, PS, Dubair,
(Kohistan Lower).

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant
Gulbaz, accompanying the dead body of his
paternal cousin Yousaf Khan, reported the matter
to the local police that he along with his cousin
were returning home after taking groceries and at

about 01:00 PM, when they reached village Sair
Barkalay Ranwalia, accused Siraj S/o Nosher,
Ajdar Khan S/o Doraj, Doraj S/o Nosher, Hussain
S/o Seraj and Satbar S/o Doraj were present in the
way, who were duly armed. On seeing the
complainant and deceased, Seraj and Ajdar Khan
started firing on Yousaf Khan who sustained
injuries and died on the spot. Rest of the accused
were present to aid accused Seraj and Ajdar Khan.
After the occurrence, accused decamped towards
their houses and meanwhile from the house of
accused Doraj, firing was heard and on query
complainant came to know that accused Doraj has
committed murder of his wife Mst. Zahib. The
motive for the occurrence was the suspicion of the
accused that both the deceased had illicit relations.
On the basis of report of the complainant, FIR was
lodged against the accused.

3. I have heard the blue streak arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and gone through
the record with their valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the

complainant has attributed specific role to each of
the accused. Accused Seraj and Ajdar Khan have
been attributed the role of making effective firing
upon deceased Yousaf Khan, accused/petitioners
Doraj, Hussain and Satbar have been attributed the
role of aiding accused Seraj and Ajdar Khan in the
murder of Yousaf Khan and accused/petitioner
Doraj had additionally been charged for
committing murder of his wife Mst. Zahib.

5. First of all, the case of accused/
petitioner Ajdar for the grant of bail is taken. He
has been directly charged for making effective
firing upon deceased Yousaf Khan. The occurrence
is witnessed by the complainant. The medical
report as well as recoveries from the spot,
strengthen the prosecution version and as_ per
available record, he is prima-facie connected with
the commission of offence which entails capital
punishment and falls within the prohibitory clause
of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Therefore, to the extent of
accused/petitioner Ajdar, no case for the grant of

bail is made out.
6. So far as the case of accused/petitioners
Doraj, Hussain and Satbar is concerned, though
they were attributed the role of aiding the main
accused in the commission no offence, however,
no overt act was attributed to them by the
complainant in the commission of offence. The
complainant never mentioned that either of them
was armed with any weapon or any Lalkara was
raised by them to commit murder of deceased
Yousaf Khan. In the case of “Muhammad Shafi &
others Vs. the State (2016 SCMR 1593)”, the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan, while allowing
bail to the accused in a similar case held that:-

“After hearing the learned
counsel for the parties and
going through the record it has
been observed by us that
admittedly both the present
petitioners were empty-handed
during the incident in issue and
they had not caused any injury
to any person during the same.
According to the prosecution
the petitioners had raised a

joint lalkara instigating their

likely to serve any beneficial
purpose. For all these reasons
we have found that the case
against the petitioners calls for
further inquiry into their guilt
within the purview of
subsection (2) of section 497,
Cr.P.C.
Tes The question as to whether the
accused/petitioners Doraj, Hussain and Satbar
were sharing common intention with the co-
accused Seraj and Ajdar, can only be answered by
the trial court. At present, tentative assessment of
the record shows that no overt act towards
commission of offence has been attributed to
accused/petitioners Hussain and Satbar and their
mere presence on the spot is shown. The allegation
of aiding the main accused in commission of
offence, also needs further probe, therefore, the
case of accused/petitioners Hussain and Satbar
squarely falls within sub Section 2 of Section 497
Cr.P.C. entitling them to the concession of bail.
8. Accused/petitioner Doraj has additionally

been charged for committing murder of his wife.
The tentative assessment of the record, however,
suggests that there is no eyewitness of said
occurrence and the father of deceased lady charged
the accused/petitioner Doraj for murder of Mst.
Zahib after 10 days of the occurrence i.e. on
28.12.2019. However, at bail stage before the
learned trial court, he appeared and expressed his
no objection upon release of petitioner Doraj on
bail. Similarly, the female legal heirs of the
deceased Mst. Zahib have also expressed their no
objection upon release of petitioner Doraj on bail.
Even otherwise, there is no eyewitness of the said
occurrence and motive alleged for the occurrence
is yet to be proved by the prosecution after
recording evidence. Though it is alleged that the
accused/petitioner Doraj has not lodged any report
regarding murder of his wife, nor could explain the
presence of dead body of his wife in his house,
however, mere presence of dead body of deceased
in the house of accused/petitioner does not ipso
facto held the petitioner responsible for the murder

and bail could not be withheld merely on the
ground that a person is unable to justify the
presence of dead body in his house. Reliance
placed on “Nasrullah Vs. The State (2017 SCMR
724)”.

9. Moreover, the alleged occurrence of murder
of wife of accused Doraj took place inside the
house of the accused and the complainant has
charged the accused/petitioner Doraj on the basis
of suspicion alone. The motive for the occurrence
is yet to be proved during trial. Moreover, the
mode and manner of murder of Mst. Zahib is also
shrouded in mystery and makes the case to fall
within the ambit of further inquiry as contemplated
in Section 497 (2) Cr.P.C.

10. Before parting with this order, this court
finds it necessary to mention that all the
observations recorded above are tentative
assessment just for the disposal of bail petition and
not intended to influence the mind of trial Court,
which is free to appraise the evidence strictly in

accordance with law and merits of the case.
Guidance could be sought from case law reported
in 1996 SCMR 1845.

11. Resultantly, this petition is partially allowed
to the extent of accused/petitioners Doraj, Hussain
and Satbar and they are admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/-
each with two sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial
Magistrate concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means, while
to the extent of accused/petitioner, Ajdar, this
petition stands dismissed.

12. These are the detailed reasons for my short
order of even date.
