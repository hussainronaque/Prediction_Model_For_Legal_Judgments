JUDGMENT

Ahmad Ali, J. Aggrieved of the grant of pre-arrest bail
to the respondent No.1 vide order dated 16.08.2017
passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II
Nowshera, the petitioner filed present petition under

Section 497(5) Cr.P.C.

2. A brief background of the present B.C.A. is
that on the report of petitioner a case vide FIR No.1287
dated 28.12.2016 u/s 489-F PPC was registered at Police
Station Nowshera Kalan. The respondent No.2/accused
filed application for the grant of pre-arrest bail,

accordingly ad-interim pre-arrest bail was granted to
respondent/accused vide order dated 05.08.2017 subject
to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.70,000/-.
Thereafter, the petitioner/complainant patched-up the
matter with the respondent/accused and submitted the
compromise deed before the learned court ASJ-II
Nowshera as Ex.PA.| Statement of complainant and
accused was recorded wherein they endorsed the terms &
conditions of compromise deed, and accordingly, the ad-
interim pre-arrest (bail granted to respondent
No.2/accused stood | confirmed vide order dated

16.08.2017.

3. After confirmation of pre-arrest bail, the
challan submitted for the trial of accused but he evaded
to appear before the learned trial court, consequently,
proceedings u/s 512 Cr.PC were initiated and finally
perpetual warrant of arrest was issued on 15.12.2017. On
19.06.2018 the respandent/ accused was arrested in
execution of the perpetual warrant of arrest. The
petitioner/complainant! filed petition for cancellation of
bail before the learned|Addl. Sessions Judge-II Nowshera
which was dismissed vide order dated 28.06.2018.
Meanwhile the responident/accused, who was arrested in

the execution of perpetual warrant of arrest, submitted

bail petition before the learned Judicial Magistrate-[
Nowshera. The said bail petition, in view of the already
granted pre-arrest | bail, was accepted and
respondent/accused was directed to furnish fresh bail
bonds worth Rs.200,000/- with two sureties. Now the
petitioner/complainant| filed present petition for the
cancellation of pre-arrest bail on the sole ground of
condition of cancellation of bail as stipulated in the

compromise deed Ex.PA.

4. Learned counsel for the
petitioner/complainant| argued that the compromise was
affected between parties with certain conditions. It was
stipulated in the compromise deed that in case the
accused failed to honour the compromise, complainant
will have the right to) apply for the cancellation of his
bail. The accused had hot only reneged the conditions of
compromise but after the grant of bail he went into
hiding and thereby betrayed the confidence of court.

Hence, his bail was liable to be recalled.

5. Learned ¢ounsel for the respondent/accused
argued that the terms of conditional bail is alien to the law

relating to criminal administration of justice. The accused

had neither tempered the record nor repeated the offence,

therefore, bail cancellation petitioner may be dismissed.

6. I have given my deep thought to the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused

the record with their able assistance.

7. After scrutinizing the record of case, it is
undisputed fact that the ad-interim pre-arrest bail of the
respondent/accused was confirmed on the basis of
compromise. There is no mention of any condition in the
impugned order which|call for the cancellation of bail.
Besides, a thorough perusal of the compromise deed
Ex.PA reveals that no/time limit for the fulfilment of
promise was fixed, therefore, it cannot be held that the
accused reneged his promise. Nothing is there to suggest
the misuse of the concession of bail or tampering with

the evidence and investigation process.

8. The stipulation of the cancellation of bail in
the compromise deed, produced as Ex.PA at BBA stage,
and the consent of parties cannot override the law.
Provisions of Section 497(5) Cr.P.C. cannot be made

subservient to the consent of complainant. Prerogative of

the Court to cancel

complainant on the basis of mutual agreement between
parties. Grant of bail on the basis of condition cannot be
sustained as principles for the grant of bail and
cancellation thereof are altogether different. in this regard
I place reliance on the wiew of this Court rendered in the

case of “Haji Hukmat Khan Vs. The State and another”

(2012 PCr.LJ 1018), wherein it was held:

“Moreover, it cannot be left to the

sweet will,

discretion and prerogative

of the complainant that he may at a
0

certain p
before a
objection

int of time make a request
Court of law for his no
over the release of an

accused on bail and still at another
time of his own choice may make a

request to

recall the bail order. The

process of law cannot be made

subservien
individual.

9, I am also

by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of “Muhammad

Tanveer VS. The St

t to the will of an
>

Supreme Court 733), wherein it was held:

“11. Itis
once the
discretion

pettled principle of law that
egislature has conferred
ion the Court to exercise

jurisdiction in particular category of

offences

without placing any

prohibition on such discretion then,
the Court) shall not import to the

the bail cannot be shifted to

fortified by the dictum laid down

ate and another? (PLD 2017
provision jof law, reasons or factors
alien thereto and not specifically
mentioned in the Statute.

12,---

13. one this Court has held in
categorical terms that grant of bail in
offences [not falling within the
prohibito limb of section 497,
Cr.P.C. shall be a rule and refusal
shall be an exception then, the Courts
of the country should follow this
principle jin its letter and_ spirit
because principles of law enunciated
by this Court are constitutionally
binding on all Courts throughout the
country including the Special
Tribunals and Special Courts.”

10. For what has been discussed above, learned
counsel for the petitioner failed to demonstrate that the
bail granting order is patently illegal, erroneous, factually
incorrect and has resulted in miscarriage of justice. No
reasonable ground exists for the cancellation of bail
granted to the respondent No.2. Consequently, the

present application is dismissed
