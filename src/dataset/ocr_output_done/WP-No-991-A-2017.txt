Date of hearing 15.11.2022.

Petitioner/s (Sheikh Zahoor Ahmed) by
Mr. Awais Khan Alizai, Advocate.

Respondent/s (The State) by Sardar Ali
Raza, AAG and respondents No. 2 and 3
(Muhammad Imtiaz & Muhamad Fiaz)
by Mr. Muhammad Shafique Awan,
Advocate.

FAZAL SUBHAN, J. Through the instant
petition filed under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, petitioner Sheikh Zahoor
Ahmed son of Sheikh Karam Bakhsh, has
invoked the jurisdiction of this Court with
the following prayer:-

“Tt is therefore, most humbly
prayed that on acceptance of
instant writ petition, — the
impugned order dated:
26.04.2016 may graciously
be set aside/ quashed and
respondents No. 2&3 may
kindly be directed to face the

trial of the case’.
2. Brief but relevant facts, giving rise to
the instant writ petition, are that on the
application of petitioner to District Police
Officer, Abbottabad case FIR No. 902
dated 10.10.2015 under Section 489-F,
420, 506, 34 PPC of PS Mirpur, District
Abbottabad was registered against
respondents No. 2 & 3 and their brother
Muhammad Khalid. After investigation
two challans were submitted, one after
another, and in the first challan, the names
of respondents No. 2 and 3 were shown in
column No. 2 but in the second challan
their names were omitted. During trial
petitioner was unaware of the factum of
discharge of respondents No. 2 & 3,
however, when the said respondents
instituted a suit for damages and when he
obtained copies of order dated 26.04.2016,
he came to know that they have been
discharged in the case. Petitioner being
dis-satisfied with the said order

approached this Court through instant
constitutional petition, under Article 199
read with Section 561 Cr.P.C.

3. | Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties heard as well as learned AAG heard
and record perused.

4.  Perusal of the record reveals that on
the application of petitioner dated
08.10.2015, addressed to the DPO,
Abbottabad, SHO Mirpur was directed for
legal action, who after inquiry into the
matter registered the above referred case.
The contentions of petitioner in the
referred application was that he had
acquaintance with Muhammad Imtiaz and
Muhammad Fayaz, respondents No. 2 & 3,
who approached him for sale of his vehicle
to their brother Khalid. On arriving to
understanding, accused Khalid provided a
cheque of 15,50,000/- of Summit Bank but
on presentation, it was dishonored and
when he demanded the amount, they
started threatening him. That upon his

application, FIR was registered but when
challan was submitted and case was put in
court for trial, impugned order dated
26.04.2016 was passed = whereby
respondents No. 2 & 3 were discharged.

5. The record reveals that at the
time of submission of first challan the
names of respondents No. 2 and 3 were
mentioned therein but later-on in the
second challan their names did not figured
there. Record depicts that as per report on
challan form, the prosecution opined that
the dishonored cheque was issued by
Khalid accused and respondents No. 2 & 3
having no role in the offence of issuing
cheque, were recommended for discharge
under Section 169 Cr.P.C, and keeping in
view the opinion of prosecution branch and
facts arising from the record, the Ilaqa
Judicial Magistrate on 26.04.2016, passed
an order of their discharge and proceeded
to try co-accused Khalid.

6. Though it is argued at length

by learned counsel for petitioner that the
IO of the case was not supposed to assume
the role of adjudicator and his duty was to
investigate the case and submit challan and
leave the sufficiency or otherwise, of
evidence to the court, however, in our
mind, this is not the situation in the present
case. In the challan, the names of
respondent No. 2 & 3 were included,
however, on the opinion of prosecution
their names were omitted from the challan
and separate application for their discharge
in the case was moved and the Ilaqa
Judicial Magistrate while keeping in view
the material on record ordered for their
discharge. At the same time prosecution
also omitted Section 420 506/34 PPC from
the challan.

7. The preamble, which is
integral part of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, has laid down the
aim objective and purpose of constitution
and it has been laid down therein that

beside other rights and obligations the
object of constitution is to observed
principle of democracy, freedom, equality,
tolerance and social justice. Such an
objective can only be achieved when laws
are made in line with the above cherished
goals. With the passage of time and
dwindling social values, laws are flouted,
molded or misused for personal gains and
objectives. In such a_ scenario, the
importance of an efficient Judicial System,
especially at criminal side, has attained
great significance to coop with ever
changing circumstance, for the reason that
it mainly effects the life and liberty of a
person/citizen. In this respect Section 169
Cr.P.C is an important tool available to an
investigation officer, conducting an
investigation in a criminal case. This
provision empowers the investigation
officer to release an accused person, if,
after investigation, he arrives to a
conclusion that there is no sufficient

evidence, reasons or grounds to justify
forwarding the accused to a Magistrate. In
that case, the SHO/IO may forward the
challan to the Magistrate and _ the
Magistrate, so empowered, has to decide
either to take cognizance on police report
and try the accused or forward him for
trial. Though the SHO/IO may report the
insufficiency of evidence but final order of
discharge is the domain of Magistrate. In
the present case, the order passed by the
Magistrate, in view of insufficient material
on record against the respondents No. 2 &
3, is neither found to be illegal nor
erroneous to call for interference and is
quite in accordance with Section 169
Cr.P.C. In this respect reliance is placed on
the judgment of this court in the case of
“Naseem Khan Vs Banaras Khan Jadoon
and 3 others, reported in 2019 P Cr.L J
154 Peshawar’ [Abbottabad Bench]
wherein it was held that;

“Perusal of record reveals
that respondent No.1 has filed
an application to the District
Police Officer, Abbottabad for
registration FIR against the
present petitioner, which was
marked to SHO _ for
registration of case and under
section 154 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, the Incharge
of Police Station is bound to
register FIR if the information
received by him relates to
commission of cognizable
offence. The arguments of
learned counsel for the
petitioner that the contents of
FIR are fake and the matter
relates to a _ transaction
regarding the sale of some
property, which did not
materialize, therefore, the
cheque in question was never
given regarding any
outstanding liability, cannot
be considered by the High
Court for quashing an FIR.
However, after registration of
the FIR, the Investigation
Officer has the authority to
determine the truthfulness or
falsehood of the allegations
levelled against the accused
but the same is subject to
affirmation of the competent
Court. If the Investigation
Officer comes to the
conclusion that the allegations
contained in the FIR are
incorrect, he may under
section 63, Cr.P.C. refer the
matter to the Magistrate for
discharge of the accused. The
Police Officer has also the
authority to release accused in
terms of section 169, Cr.P.C.,
if he comes to the conclusion
that there is no sufficient
evidence or reasonable
ground of suspicion to justify
the forwarding of accused to
the Magistrate, such Officer
shall, if such person is in
custody, release him on
executing of bond with or
without sureties and direct
him to appear, if and when
required before the Magistrate
empowered to take cognizance
of the offence. It is then the
Magistrate to pass such order
as deemed appropriate under
section 173, Cr.P.C. for
discharge of such bond or
otherwise he deems fit”.

8. Similarly, in the case of “Basar
Khan Vs the State and another”, reported
in 2009 P Cr. L J Karachi 964, it was
observed in the following words;-

No doubt it is not the ipse dixit
of police to decide the fate of
the case and opinion of
Investigating Officer is not
binding upon the Court, but it
would also be most unfair to
drag an innocent person into
Court and leave him to face
hardships of criminal _ trial,
though prima facie offence is
not made out against him. The
police and Magistrate are not
prevented and precluded by any
provision of law to act fairly
and justly. On the contrary the
law favours justice and fair
play at every stage of the case.

9. For the above reasons, we are
of the considered view that the impugned
order was neither illegal nor unjustified

and the Magistrate, while keeping in view
10

the result of investigation and _ the
allegations in the FIR, has passed a just
and valid order, which cannot be disturbed
in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction,
hence, this petition being without any
merits, is dismissed.

Announced.
