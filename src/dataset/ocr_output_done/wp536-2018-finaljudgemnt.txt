“a Supreme Court and in the case of “Said Zaman Khan and
Page | 144
others versus Federation of Pakistan through Secretary
Ministry of Defence and others reported in 2017 SCMR
1249. Wherein it has been held that any order/sentence passed
by any forum including military courts, is open for judicial
review under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan to
the High Court and under Article 184 (3) to the Supreme
Court of Pakistan on grounds of (i) jurisdiction, (ii)
Malafide, (iii) Malice in Law, (iv) Infringements of rights,
(v) violation of Law, (vi) non-treating as per law and unfair
trial.

6. In the reported judgment PLD 2015 SC 401, the
amendment i.e. constitutional 21 Amendment Act, No. 1 of
2015, has been elaborately discussed in view of different
constitutional provisions by holding it a lawful and legal
document and within the basic structure of the constitution. It
may be pointed out here that 21 Amendment Act No. 1 of
2015 was a sunset legislation i.e. for a period of two years,
therefore on its expiry 23’ Amendment Act, XII of 2017, was
promulgated from 07.01.2017, for yet another period of two
years. Precisely vide the said judgment, while discussing all
other aspects, in reference to Pakistan Army Act No. XXXIX,

A 1952, it has been held that ouster of jurisdiction of high court
Page | 145
under Article 199 (3) of the Constitution was not relevant
where the impugned proceedings, action, or order of Military
Court was without jurisdiction, corum non judice and malafide
etc.

7. In the reported judgment, in the case of “Said
Zaman Khan and others versus Federation of Pakistan”
reported in 2017 SCMR 1249, the Hon’ble Apex court while
dilating upon the convictions and sentence awarded by Field
General Court Martial (FGCM) or other forums under the
Pakistan Army Act, 1952, as amended by Pak Army Amended
Act, 2015, was subjected to judicial review both by the High
Court and the Supreme Court, interalia, on the ground of corum
non judice, without jurisdiction or suffering from malafides
including malice of law, and has defined the said propositions
of law. While defining corum non judice, words & phrases it
has been held as under;-

(c) Corum Non Judice

“ Coram non judice, was a fatal flaw germane to the very
constitution of the judicial forum rendering its proceedings non est
in the eye of law. - - Forum may be vested with the jurisdiction yet

its actions may be invalid, if such forum had been set up in clear and
absolute violation of the law applicable in such behalf.

(f) Malice---
----'Malice of fact' and 'malice in law'---Distinction and proof.

Where any action was taken or order passed by any forum not
/’ with the intention of fulfilling its mandate or to achieve its purpose
‘)

but was inspired by a collateral purpose or instigated by a personal
motive to wrongfully hurt somebody or benefit oneself or another, it
was said to suffer from 'malice of facts’. In such cases, the seat of the
malice or bad faith was the evil mind of the person taking the action
be it spite or personal bias or ulterior motive. Mere allegations, in
such behalf, did not suffice. Malice of fact must be pleaded and
established at least prima facie on record through supporting
material.

All persons purporting to act under a law are presumed to be
aware of it. Hence, where an action taken was so unreasonable,
improbable or blatantly illegal that it ceased to be an action
countenanced or contemplated by the law under which it was
purportedly taken malice would be implied and the act would be
deemed to suffer from ‘malice in law’ or 'constructive malice’. Strict
proof of bad faith or collateral propose in such cases may not be
required.

Judicial review---Grounds---'Malafides of fact'---Any proceedings
taken, convictions and sentences awarded by the Field General Court
Martial (FGCM) could be called into question on the ground of
malafides of fact i.e. being tainted with bias or bad faith or taken for
a collateral purpose or inspired by a personal motive to hurt a person
or benefit oneself or another---Mere allegation that an action had
been taken wrongly was not sufficient to establish malafide of fact---
Specific allegations of the collateral purpose or an ulterior motive
must be made and proved to the satisfaction of the Court.

purpose it was sufficient to establish that the action complained of
was not only illegal but so unreasonable and improbable that it could
not be said to be contemplated or countenanced by the law where
under such action had purportedly been taken---Malice in law would
include an act done wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or
probable justification.

----S. 97---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 184(3) & 199---Conviction
and sentence awarded by Field General Court Martial (FGCM)---
Judicial review---Grounds---'Coram non judice' and ‘without

constitution of the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) the actions
taken thereby would be Coram non judice and hence, also without
jurisdiction---Actions complained of could even otherwise be
without jurisdiction, a separate and independent ground available to
challenge the sentences and convictions of the FGCM, therefore, it
must necessarily be examined whether the FGCM had the
jurisdiction over the person tried and the offence for which such trial
had taken place and to ascertain existence or otherwise of any other
defect or a gross illegality in the exercise of jurisdiction denuding
the same of validity.

(j) Pakistan Army Act (XXXIX of 1952)---

----S. 97---Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 199---Conviction and
sentence awarded by Field General Court Martial (FGCM)---Judicial
review by the High Court---Scope---Powers of judicial review under
Art. 199 of the Constitution, against the sentences and convictions of
the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) was not legally identical to
the powers of an Appellate Court---Evidence produced could not be
analyzed in detail to displace any reasonable or probable conclusion
drawn by the FGCM nor could the High Court venture into the realm
of the "merits" of the case---High Court could, however, always
satisfy itself that it was not a case of no evidence or insufficient
evidence or the absence of jurisdiction.

8. The perusal of above quoted judgments of the apex
court and finally the judgment of our own High Court, in the
case of Muhammad Ayaz versus Superintendent District Jail,
Taimergara, District Lower Dir and three others reported in
(PLD 2018 Peshawar 1), it is held that, High Court, in its
constitutional jurisdiction only had the legal mandate to
positively interfere with the decision of the Military Courts, on
certain fundamental grounds i.e. If the case of the prosecution

A was based, firstly, on no evidence, secondly, insufficient
C)

Page |148
evidence, thirdly, absence of jurisdiction, finally malice of
facts & law.

9. On merits each and every case individually, argued
by the private counsel of the convict / petitioners and the sacred
record, photocopy of which delivered at the time of arguments
by the respondents/representative of the Field General Court
Martial (FGCM)/Military Personnel in civil dress alongwith
with Deputy Attorney General & AAG also heard and record
examined.

10 It is observed from the record, so produced that
they have erased each and every date, the names of the
prosecution’s witnesses, their designations, and many other
things. On the direction of this court the record was made
available to the learned counsel for the convicts/petitioners, but
for a very short time and they were permitted to take their own
notes and that too with a pencil. By the end of arguments since
it was observed that all these proceedings of the prosecution are
based only on confession/judicial confession, representative
were directed to produce the list of Judicial Magistrates, who
recorded the same as all the particulars on the confessional
statements so recorded were erased by them in the photocopies,

A which after much discussion were provided in a sealed
C+

Page [149

envelope with the assurance from court that the same will not
be published or be made public in order to protect the said
judicial officers from any harm in the hands of terrorist. The
said document is with the Court Officer and will not be placed
on record whereas rest of the entire record in the shape of
Photostat has been made part and parcel of the file/writ petition.
11. The perusal of entire record in each and every case
would show that none of the convict was ever, by name
mentioned or nominated in any of the report, so formulated or
registered by the prosecution. In majority of the cases there is
no FIR or any authentic report of the PATA/FATA authorities
in this respect. Even in the secret reports of the
prosecution/Army/Intelligence no one has been named till the
time, someone was apprehended/arrested and he was shifted to
the internment center, where each and every one who has been
apprehended or arrested from anywhere in the down country, is
framed in a particular charge and then after years of
confinement, he is abruptly produced before the authorities for
recording of confessional statements and that too in the same
tone and language and then before the Field General Court
Martial (FGCM). In the case reported in P L D 1976 Supreme

4 Court 57, titled Islamic Republic of Pakistan through

Page | 150

secretary, Ministry of Interior and Kashmir affairs,
Islamabad-_applicant/referring authority Versus Abdul

Wali Khan, M. N. A., Former President of Defunct National

Awami Party, the apex Court in similar situation has held as

under:-

(n) Evidence Act (I of 1872) -

S.  3-Hearsay _ evidence-Spy-Informer-Oral
evidence based purely on hearsay-Not admissible
unless informant, or source of evidence,
produced to give evidence-Such sources, in most
cases, either spies or informers-Authenticity of
source of such information-Not on higher level
than evidence of spy or informer-Courts usually
tend to look upon such evidence with some
"degree of disfavour"- Spy or informer not
called in to support version given by him-
Reliability of report based on information given
by spy or informer not enhanced even if coming
through agency of a very highly placed
responsible officer.

(0) Evidence Act (I of 1872)-

-- S. 35-Source Reports, evidentiary value of-
Material contained in source or intelligence
reports-May well be of great value for executive
decisions-For purposes of judicial inquiry,
however. such reports of no assistance at all
unless authorities concerned prepared to
produce sources themselves for giving evidence
before Court-Adoption of such course, however,
tending to expose such sources to grave personal
dangers and to destroy entire intelligence
collecting system of Government, source
material collected from foreign countries
accepted and allowed to be drawn upon only to
such extent as it stood corroborated from
happenings of events mentioned in report
provided such events established all under by
reliable evidence.

The material contained in such source or

Intelligence Reports may well be of great value

so far as executive’ decisions are concerned, but

for the purposes of a judicial enquiry, they

cannot be of any assistance at all unless the

A authorities concerned are prepared to produce
¢
Page | 151

the sources themselves for giving evidence before
the Court. This the authorities have not done in
the present case on the ground that to do so
would expose the source to grave personal
dangers and destroy the entire intelligence
collecting system of the Government. The
Attorney-General, therefore, suggested that so
far as information collected from foreign
countries is concerned, the source material may
be accepted by relaxing, if necessary, the rules of
evidence, as indicated in an earlier order of the
Court for otherwise, it would amount to asking
him to discharge an almost impossible onus. The
Court held that it was not unconscious of his
difficulties and, therefore, will allow him to draw
upon the source report only to the extent that it
has received corroboration from the happening
of the events mentioned in the report, if those
events have been established aliunde by reliable
evidence. Thus, if the source report discloses that
a certain line of action is planned or proposed to
be taken by certain persona and such actions do
in fact take place, then to the extent that the
actions take place, the source report may be
relied upon as confirmation of the fact that the
action was taken in pursuance of a plan as
ascribed to in the report.

Likewise, in the case reported in 1982 SCMR-321, titled

The State versus Asfandyar Wali and two others (d), it was

held as under:-

(c) Evidence Act (I of 1872)-
-S. 35-Intelligence reports-Admissibility-Evidence
of witness based on intelligence reports and
witness not author of such reports Such evidence,
held, inadmissible in evidence.

12. The proceedings after the arrest of each and every
convict are exactly the same, to a question where one of the
convict has said NO or YES the same is till the last

a convict/petitioner. No one has deviated from the principle stand
>

(

Page | 152

of the prosecution where-under they are required to produce the
evidence, recorded the confessional statement, except the
presence of private counsel nominated by the prosecution etc
and finally the plead guilty statement. There is no eye witness
of the occurrence or for the presence of convicts even, the
injured were never produced in any of the case reflecting that
all the proceedings conducted by three such courts established,
had a clear mind-set.

13. Tentatively, to be discussed later on, the entire
judicial confessional statements recorded in Urdu are in one and
the same hand writing and in one specific tone/style. All these
facts and figures are to be discussed as, in view of the above
legal premises/parameters defined by the apex court, permit this
court to dilate upon, specially Article 10(A) of the
Constitutional of Islamic Republic of Pakistan which
guaranteed fair trial to its citizen and admittedly all the convicts
are Pakistani civilians, illiterate and Pushto speaking citizens.
In the case of Waris Ali and 5 others versus the State (f) (2),

reported in 2017 SCMR-1572, it was held as under:-

(f) Interpretation of statutes-—-

--—-"Penal statute"---Scope---Whenever a penal

statute required interpretation, it shall be

interpreted in a way which favored the accused

yA person and not the State—-If statute was
i susceptible to two interpretations, then it must
)

Page | 153

be interpreted in favour of the accused.
(g) Constitution of Pakistan---

---Art. 4(1)---Right to be dealt with in
accordance with law---Scope---If any citizen was
triable under the ordinary penal law of the land,
then, treating him harshly under a special law,
not clearly applicable to him, would be a
violation of Art. 4(1) of the Constitution.

14. The conduct of the prosecution as well as the
security agencies, in relations to the present convictions could
be discussed as by now the agencies are not security agencies
rather have become prosecutors and as such the norms of justice
in view of the Cr.P.C and Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are
to be taken into consideration.

15. The record so produced in all the cases, which is in
the shape of photocopies, names, designations and dates
including the signatures are erased, reasons best known to the
respondents. In all the cases there are four prosecution
witnesses except % cases where 5/7 witnessed entered in the
witness box. It is admitted at the bar that for Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa there were in all three Field General Court
Martial (FGCM) Courts and each and every document on file
would show that all the three courts were functioning on one
and the same patron not even a single accused has deviated,

A differently to the questions put on him. None of the
Page | 154
accused/convict has objected to the President of the said courts.
The waiting member in all the proceedings was directed to
withdraw from the court rooms and then he withdraws. The
questions put to the all accused are one and the same with
exactly the same answers in all the cases. Even for the purpose
of engaging private counsel the same format would reflect there
were planed proceeding in all the three said courts. For ready
reference the proceedings on plea of not guilty, decision of the

court in this respect are quoted as under;-

PROCEEDINGS O PLEA OF NOT GUILTY.

Question to accused.

Do you wish to apply for adjournment on the ground that
any of the rules relating to the procedure before the trial have not
been complied with, and that you have been prejudiced thereby or
on the ground that you have not had sufficient opportunity for
preparing your defense?

Answer by the accused. No.

Question to accused,
Do you wish to engage a Civil Defense Counsel of your
own choice to plead your case at your own expense?

Answer by the accused. No.
Question to accused.
Do you wish that Civil Defense Counsel be provided to

you at state expense or you want to defending officer to
plead your case?

Answer by the accused. I want services of Civil Defense
Counsel on state expense.

DECISION BY THE COURT.

L The court decides, that as desired by the accused, a Civil
of Defense Counsel be engaged to plead the case of the accused on
Page | 155

state expense, and therefore, the court should be adjourned. Then
one and the same counsel.

16. The prosecution first witness in all the cases,
although a different person but in a same language, patron and
tone has recorded his statement except the date and time of
occurrence with the names of the casualties. The said witness is
crossed examined by the defense counsel, which again if
compared in all the cases, in the same waves and then there is a
reexamination by the prosecutor and questioned by the court in
which same language has been used not only by the same court
but by all three courts. Same is the position of second to fourth
prosecution witnesses then cross examined by the defense
counsel, reexamination by the prosecution and question by the
court. In the defense statement none of the accused intended to
call any witness in defense with a big answer of NO. All the
accused/convicts very consistently replied to the question,
“have you anything to say in your defense, and they said YES”
and then the statement of the accused/convict would show that
whatever he/they were briefed in the internment center and
witness No. 1 has uttered in his evidence before court, and
he/they narrated in the confessional statement and finally in the

A statement so recorded in the court. It is important to mention

Page | 156

here that all the proceedings are in English except judicial
confession. It is also appreciated that the accused/convict in
each and every case was cross examined by the prosecutor,
reexamined by the defense counsel, and then questioned by the
court. This court was able to go through certain numbers of
files record; clearly showing that one and the same patron of the
questions were put and replied. The witness to the character of .
the accused in almost all cases was asked exactly similar
questions by the President of the proceedings; reply was the
same and in the end it has been typed that the defense counsel
declines to cross examine this witness. The parties decline to
suggest any questions. In the end of the proceedings a question
to the accused was put i.e. “Do you wish to address the court,
answer by the accused, I have done all these deeds
considering them a just cause however, now I realized that I
has suffered a lot and except my follies I should be treated
leniently and given a chance to prove myself as a changed
man and become a useful member of the society.” Such
working in all the cases is observed. The accused after
remaining in the Internment Centres for years astonishingly
remember the date, time and minutes, which is witnessed for

A the first time in the criminal proceedings. The confessional
Page | 187
statements recorded after accused remained in police custody
even for six days and then he was handed over to the
investigating officer after recording of his confessional
statement is always discouraged. These defects have been
declared as material and in these circumstances the confessional
statement would become unbelievable. Likewise such
confessions would be concocted easily, therefore, the same are
always looked with doubt and suspicion. The extra judicial
confession could be taken as collaborative of the charge if it, in
the first instance, ranged true and then found support from other
evidence of unimpeachable character, which is totally missing
in all the cases, discussed herein. It has been time and again
held by the Courts that if the other evidence lacked such
attribute, such confession had to be excluded from
consideration. Since, long it has become a practice that the
Courts generally refrained from basing conviction solely on
confession and have always sought for same reliable
collaborative evidence regarding material particulars in the
confessional statements. In the instant cases, the confessional
statements are belated and retracted one ranging from six

Wi months to five / eight years. In this respect the law which has

C }

Page | 158

developed is 2016 SCMR-1144, 1995 SCMR-351, 2009
SCMR-04 & PLD, 2012 Pesh-22.

17. In certain cases there are FIRs on record, in which
there are number of accused as well, by name and according to
the petitioners/convicts the co-accused were treated under the
normal law and the accused arrayed in those cases have been
acquitted as well. Whereas Maj: Kashif and Col: Rizwan
alongwith Deputy Attorney General and Assistant Advocate
General categorically stated at the bar that they have no record
to the effect as they have no liaison with the civil
administration. Even time was given to produce such record to
which the reply was the same. Few such acquittal orders are
placed on record by the petitioners.

18. On record there are certain death certificates, but
no postmortem report is available, regarding injured, as already
observed that not even a single injured was produced in any of
the case. A document placed on each and every file under the
heading Secret Part-II, the date of apprehension from the area
(arrest) is erased and subsequently he was interned on the date
mentioned therein which is months and months apart. Nothing

is on record that during this period where accused/convict was

A kept. There is nothing on record showing that for months and
_ Page | 159
months in the internment center accused/convict was in whose
custody and was kept in which condition, who took them before
the Judicial Magistrate for recording the confessional statement
and thereafter; to whom they were handed over. During the
period of internment or the period when trial was under process
whether any accused was given excess to the relatives because
in number of cases the complaints were received in the Human
Right Cell, P.H.C.P, regarding the missing of convicts by the
parents, spouses and the children/close blood relatives, which
complaints were converted into writ petition, and when put to
notice, the respondents for months and months sought time for
replies. The matter were delayed for a considerable time and
during this time they use to inform the court that “NOT
HELD” and subsequently in some of the cases they came up,
that so and so is held in the interment centers. The reasons for
giving these particulars are to show that no independent advised
was available to the accused during their confinement and trial
and all the proceedings are like the Police formula of untraced
cases.

19. After the provisions of private defense counsel and
that too; on State expense the respondents / prosecution did

WA engage private counsel belonging to the Province of Punjab and

,
Page | 160
his standing at the bar seems to be, not more then 5/6 years.
How, he represented the accused/convicts and in which
language and at which place he use to consult them is a
mystery. Even the face / photo of learned counsel on the
photocopy of LD card issued by Punjab Bar Counsel has been
erased.

20. We have before us the confessional statements of
almost all the convicts and we appreciate with naked eye that
all of them are recorded in one & the same handwriting. All
these statements have been thumb impressed by the accused /
convicts with no mention of identity card number etc. Although
the Judicial Magistrate have signed the same confession but
nothing is on record showing that all the formalities for
recording the judicial confessional statements were complied
with or not? However one thing is very much clear that they
were produced by the prosecution and after recording their
confessional statements they were handed over to the same
persons. These confessional statements were recorded after
much delay from the date of arrest, confined in internment
center, when they were having no excess or the facility to meet
their relatives even the parents/close blood relations. Nothing is

A on record to justify, which was even otherwise the
Page | 161

responsibility of the prosecution to show, that they were having

independent advice at their arms, before the confession and

during trial. In the case of STATE Versus Asfandyar Wali

And 2 Others reported in 1982 SCMR-321, (a), (b) & (c) it

was held as under:-

Gl

(a) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)-

--S. 164-Confession-Coercion-Confession
obtained after six weeks of detention in
Police custody-No remand order or order
for such detention produced-Confession
having been obtained after keeping
accused in illegal Police custody for six
weeks, hell, justifiably refused to be
accepted as genuine.

(b) Criminal Procedure Code (V of
1898)-

-- S. 164-Confession-Coercion-Accused
kept in dungeons of a medieval Fort
depicting ghastly picture of grave where
none could maintain balance of his mind,
even if kept for a day-Such dungeons "
dark and dingy where none could keep
his stamina in tact and in order to get
temporary relief would be prepared to
take any course even though detrimental
to him-Confession recorded during such a
situation, held, can hardly be said to have
not been obtained under coercion.

(c) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)-

S. 164-Confession-Coercion-Magistrate's
duty-Delay in recording confession
absolutely shocking-Accused literally
produced from dungeons of a medieval
Fort-Such circumstances having invited
suspicion, Magistrate recording
confession, held, ought to have questioned
accused about his treatment in custody
and should have satisfied for himself as to
accused’s body having not borne any
marks of _ ill-treatment-Elementary
safeguards for recording confession
having been disregarded, no reliance,
held, can be placed on confession.

Likewise, in the case titled as Muhammad Pervez and

others the State and others, reported in 2007 SCMR-670,

it was held as under:-

(a) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)---

-—--Ss. 395, 396, 397, 412 & 148---
Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898),
S.164--Reappraisal of evidence---Judicial
confession---Unexplained delay—-
Exculpatory _—statement--Return _ of
accused to police custody after recording
their confession---Accused, after their
arrest, were subjected to torture and
thereafter confessional statement was
recorded before Magistrate---Trial Court
as well as Federal Shariat Court mainly
relied upon the confessional statement of
accused and convicted and sentenced
them to life imprisonment---Plea raised
by accused was that confessional
statement was recorded with unexplained
delay and was a result of torture---
Validity---Delay of over 24 hours would
normally be fatal to acceptance of judicial
confession and prosecution failed to
explain the delay in recording of
confessional statement--Such delay
created doubt regarding confessional
piece of evidence--Mere delay of 24
hours in recording confessional
statements was not fatal but surrounding
circumstances were also to be considered
regarding believing or not believing
confessional statement---Accused were
tortured by police, therefore, courts
below were not justified to come to the
conclusion that confessional statement
was voluntarily made by accused---
Accused, after recording of confessional
statement were handed back to police,
such type of confession was irrelevant---
Accused remained in police custody
before and after recording confession for
24 hours and Magistrate had taken only
one hour to record confession of the
accused, such type of confession would
not fall in the category of voluntary
confession---Both the courts below erred
in law to accept confessional statement,
which was exculpatory in  nature---
Statements of eye-witnesses-was not in
consonance with each other and there
were material contradictions and
ee

o

Ismail Versus the State, the apex Court has held as under:-

improvements in their statements which
were not noted by Federal Shariat Court
in their true perspective---Person making
improvements could not be held worthy
of credence---Supreme Court converted
petition for leave to appeal into appeal
and set aside the conviction and sentence
awarded to accused by the courts below--
-Appeal was allowed.

The most important factors and required standards of

@

Gi)

(iii)

(iv)

(¥)

(vi)

(vii)

confession may be cited below:-
"Tt should be ensured,

that the accused is in full senses and understands
the consequences of making a confession;

that, the confession was not a result of any
duress, coercion or any promise by the
prosecution, to be made an approver;

that, during transit of the accused by the police
from and to the Trial Court from the prison, on
each "Paishi" no threat or pressure was applied
by the escorting police guard or incharge
thereof;

what were the actual facts, which induced the
accused to confess after facing trial, during
which he pleaded innocence all the way;

the court recording the confession has to ensure
that the mental capacity of the accused is not
diminished due to any illness and if some
indication of abnormality is suspected by the
Court, it is better to refer the accused to the
Standing Medical Board to ascertain the true
cause thereof;

While recording the confession, the same
safeguards and precautions be adopted, by
directing the Public Prosecutor, the
complainant's counsel, the Naib Court and all
other officials to leave the Court. If need be, the
counsel who represents him, may be given an
opportunity to be present inside the Court
during the whole process, if the accused person,
on asking by the Trial Judge, so demands;

the handcuffs of the accused be removed and he
be provided a chair on the dais. He may be given
some time to think over the making of the

Page | 163

In the case, reported in 2017 SCMR-713, titled Muhammad
a

confession and in that regard particular
questions be put to him, as to why he was
making the confession when he has already
pleaded innocence and claimed trial at the time,
the formal charge was framed;

(viii) the Trial Judge shall explain to the accused that, in case

(ix)

of making confession, he has to face a capital
sentence in a murder case or any offence
punishable with death;

the entire record of all the questions and answers
recorded, be properly maintained and
thereafter, a proper certificate be appended
thereto, showing the satisfaction of the Trial
Judge that the accused person was not mentally
sick and he was making the confession
voluntarily, based on true facts and that, there
was no other compelling reason behind that.

As the above procedure was not adopted,
therefore, it was incorrectly construed by the
Courts below as confession of the accused. Under
the law, it may be treated as an admission of the
appellant, however, on the basis of admission
alone, accused person cannot be awarded a
capital punishment because admission, as has
been defined by Article 30 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, is only a relevant fact and
not a proof by itself, as has been envisaged in
Article 43 of the Order, 1984, where a proved,
voluntary and true confession alone is held to be
a proof against the maker therefore, both the
Courts below have fallen in error by treating this
halfway admission to be a confession of guilt on
the part of the appellant.

It is a bedrock principle of law that, once a
Statute or rule directs that a particular act must
be performed and shall be construed in a
particular way then, acting contrary to that is
impliedly prohibited. That means, doing of
something contrary to the requirements of law
and rules, is impliedly prohibited. Therefore, it is
held that the admission of the appellant cannot
be a substitute for a true and voluntary
confession, recorded after adopting a due
process of law and it cannot be made the sole
basis of conviction on a capital charge.

Similarly in the case reported in 2016 SCMR-274, (c) Azeem

Khan versus Mujahid Khan, a view has been rendered which reads

as under:-

(c) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)-

----Ss. 164 & 364--High Court (Lahore) Rules and
Page | 165

Orders, Vol. HI, Chap. XII---Judicial confession before
Magistrate, recording of---Procedure and precautions
to be observed by Magistrate for recording judicial
confession of an accused.

Following procedure and precautions are to be
observed by a Trial Court for recording judicial
confession of an accused.

Before recording confession and that too in crimes
entailing capital punishment, the recording Magistrate
had to essentially observe all the mandatory precautions
(laid down in the High Court Rules and Orders).
Fundamental logic behind the same was that, all signs
of fear inculcated by the investigating agency in the
mind of the accused were to be shed out and he was to
be provided full assurance that in case he was not guilty
or was not making a confession voluntarily then in that
case, he would not be handed over back to the police.
Thereafter, sufficient time for reflection was to be given
after the first warning was administered. At the expiry
of such time, recording Magistrate had to administer
the second warning and the accused shall be assured
that now he was in the safe hands, All police officials
whether in uniform or otherwise, including Naib Court
attached to the Court must be kept outside the Court
and beyond the view of the accused. After observing all
these legal requirements if the accused person was
willing to confess then, all required questions as
formulated by the High Court Rules and Orders should
be put to him and the answers given, be recorded in the
words spoken by him. Statement of accused should be
recorded by the Magistrate with his own hand and in
case there was a genuine compelling reason then, a
special note was to be given that the same was dictated
to a responsible official of the Court like stenographer
or reader and oath shall also be administered to such
official that he would correctly type or write the true
and correct version. In case, the accused was illiterate,
and made a confession, which was recorded in another
language i.e. Urdu or English, then the same should be
read-over and explained to him in the language he fully
understood, and thereafter a certificate, as required
under section 364, Cr.P.C. with regard to these
proceedings should be given by the Magistrate under
his seal and signatures and the accused shall be sent to
jail on judicial remand and during this process at no
occasion he shall be handed over to any police
official/officer whether he was Naib Court wearing
police uniform, or any other police official/officer,
because such careless dispensation would considerably
diminish the voluntary nature of the confession, made
by the accused.

21. In almost all the writ petitions there is no order of
conviction / sentence showing that it was communicated to the

a said relatives as they are alleging that they came to know
_ Page | 166
regarding the conviction and sentence through press. There is
nothing on record showing that during trial the relatives, who
were frequently requesting for a meeting with the apprehended /
accused in interment center, were informed or were of the
knowledge regarding the trial proceedings. Before this court in
all the writ petitions, the relatives have engaged costly and
senior counsel which reflects that during trial the same facility
was not made available to the accused / convicts. Out of the lot
in seventy plus cases, no one opted for engaging a private
counsel at their own expenses but the fact is obvious that it was
a complete prosecution show and accused / convicts were
denied of their legal and fundamental right for engaging a
private counsel at their expenses. The so called private counsel
at state expenses was just a dummy, to fill in the blanks in this
respect as is done in all other proceedings.

22. The PWs 1 and 2 in all the cases narrated the story
as in the confessional statement so obtained from the
accused/convicts. The court statement of the accused is exactly
in the same patron as in all the cases. Even the witness to
signing of voluntary statement by the accused, also belongs to

the prosecution confirming that there was a complete

A prosecution.
Page | 167
23. In each and every case the photocopies of the
record so provided, each and every date, designation, signature
has been erased however, probably inadvertently few such dates
have been left un attended by the respondent. In WP 3461-
P/2018, the judicial magistrate has recorded in response to
question No. 5 that how long you have been in police custody?
Since these documents of the prosecution are entirely same in
all the cases, therefore word police has not been erased. In
response to the same the accused convicts says, in army custody
since 03.07.2016 and at the bottom RO&AC date is given
12.07.2017 which means that exactly after one year and nine
days of his custody with army he was produced for confessional
statement. Such proceedings could not be put to any prudent
mind for the purpose of criminal trial and that too for the
conviction and capital sentence. Even in the deep appreciation
while going through the confessional statement not even a
single statement in the entire, more than 72 writ petitions,
would show that no one has confessed that I did this particular
act by killing so & so. Yes of course each and every rule of the
Pakistan Army Act has been followed and prepared by just
getting signature of the others which is not appealing to the

fp prudent mind that how and why all the three Field General
Page | 168

Court Martial (FGCM), president, prosecution witnesses, so
called private counsel and others were thinking with the same
mind and question to be put to the accused facing trial and with
same mind set. As already observed above there is no report
prior to the arrest of the particular person/accused/convict that
he is by name charged in any particular case rather after the
arrest each and every accused/convict was kept and framed in a
particular occurrence/act.

24. All the cases, in view of the above facts and
figures are cases of no evidence, if the alleged confessional
statements are subtracted, pulled out of the entire proceedings.
The alleged confessional statement with no independent advice
after months / years of confinement with military and
internment centers is a manufactured story obtained and
subscribed one, totally reflecting the intention to fill in the
blanks, by way of untraced cases. All circumstances must be so
interlinked, making out a single unbroken chain, where one and
of the same touches the dead body and other, the neck of the
accused. Any missing link in the chain would destroy the whole
and would render the same unreliable for recording a conviction
on a capital charge. In case of circumstantial evidence there are

wa chances of procuring and fabrication of evidence, therefore,
Page | 169

courts were required to take extra care and caution to narrowly
examine such evidence with pure judicial approach to satisfy
itself, about its intrinsic worth and reliability, also ensuring that
no dishonesty was committed during the course of collecting
such evidence by the investigators. The illegality and
irregularities in recording confessional statements, recorded
after long custody, benefit of which is always given to the
accused. In this respect reliance is placed on the case reported
in 2007 SCMR-670, titled Muhammad Pervez and _ others
versus The State _and others, Haq Nawaz and another v.
State 2000 SCMR 785; Mehmood Ahmed _ and 2 others vy.

25. In all these cases, the plea of the convicts is that
confessional statements were recorded with unexplained delay
and was a result of torture. The delay of over 24 hours would
normally be fatal to acceptance of judicial confession and in all
these cases; there is no reason, whatsoever by the prosecution
regarding such delay. In all the cases wherein there is a loss of
human life, capital punishment has been awarded, even if the
charge is of abetment. In the case of injuries in an occurrence,
the punishment of life has been awarded, even to the charge of
abetment also. For lost to the property the punishment of fifteen
years to twenty years has been awarded, with no proof
whatsoever regarding the physical presence on spot of the
convicts, except the so called confessional statements. There is
nothing on record showing that anyone was acquitted in any
case.

26. Article 10-A of the Constitution guarantees right to
fair trial, which reads “For the determination of his civil rights
and obligations or in any criminal charge agsint him a person
shall be entitled to a fair trial and due process”. The fair
trial means grant of a proper hearing to an accused person by an
unbiased comptent forum and that justice should not only be

4 done but be seen to be done. Right of fair trial, cast on an
Page |171
adjudicating tribunal or forum, a duty to treat a person in
accordance with law, to grant him a fair hearing, and for
himself to be an impartial and a fair tribunal. In this respect we

are forfeited by the judgment of apex Court in the case reported

in PLD 2012 Supreme Court-553, Suo Motu Case No. 4 of
2010, (Contempt proceedings against Syed Yousaf_ Raza
Gillani, the Prime Minister _of Pakistan regarding non-
compliance of Court order dated 16.12.2009, which reads as
under:-

(a) Constitution of Pakistan---

---Art. 10A---"Right to fair trial---Scope and
meaning---Right to a ‘fair trial' means right to a
proper hearing by an unbiased competent forum,
with the latter component being based on the
maxim: "Nemo debet esse judex in propria causa"
that "no man can be a judge in his own cause"---
Said principle has been expounded to mean that a
Judge must not hear a case in which he has
personal interest, whether or not his decision is
influenced by his interest, for "justice should not
only be done but be seen to have been done"---
Right to a fair trial has been associated with the
fundamental right of access to justice, which
should be read in every statute even if not
expressly provided for unless specifically
excluded---While incorporating Article 10A in the
Constitution and making the right, to a ‘fair trial’
a fundamental right, the legislature did not define
or describe the requisites of a ‘fair trial’, which
showed that perhaps the intention was to give it
the same meaning as is broadly universally
recognized and embedded in jurisprudence in
Pakistan.

(b) Constitution of Pakistan---

----Arts. 8 & 10A--- Law, custom or usage
which is inconsistent with the right to a fair
trial---Scope---Law, or custom or usage
having the force of law, which is
inconsistent with the right to a 'fair trial’
AL would be void by virtue of Article 8 of the
ca ° a
° Constitution.
Page |172
Likewise, in the case reported in 2016 SCMR-943, titled
Ishtiag_ Ahmad versus Hon’ble Competent Authority through

Registrar, Supreme Court of Pakistan.

(a) Constitution of Pakistan--

-—-Art. 9---'Access to justice'---Definition—-
Access to justice had been defined as an equal
right to participate in every institution where
law was debated, created, found, organized,
administered interpreted and applied---Broadly
it had been described as an integral part of the
rule of law in constitutional democracies and was
a hallmark of civilized society.

(e) Constitution of Pakistan---

----Art. 10-A--Right of fair trial---Scope—Right of
fair trial meant grant of a proper hearing to an
accused person by an unbiased competent forum,
and that justice should not only be done but be seen
to be done---Right of fair trial cast on an
adjudicatory tribunal or forum a duty to treat a
person in accordance with law, to grant him a fair
hearing, and for itself to be an impartial and a fair
tribunal.

Similarly in the case reported in PLD-2014 Supreme Court-232

titled Sarfraz Saleem versus Federation of Pakistan and others, it was

held as under:-

(c) Constitution of Pakistan---

-—Arts. 4 & 10A---Equal protection of law—
Scope—-Articles 4 & 10A of the Constitution
ensured that all individuals should enjoy equal
protection of law and should be treated in
accordance with law, which was their inalienable
right--Every person for determination of his civil
rights and obligations or in any criminal charge
against him should be entitled to fair trial and due
process.

In the case of Malak Jehangir Khan and others versus Sardar

Ali and 2 others, reported in 2007 SCMR-1404, the apex Court has

held as under:-

----Ss. 302(b) & 201---Constitution of Pakistan
(1973), Art.185(3)--- Appeal against acquittal---
4 ? Only piece of evidence against the accused was
Page | 173

retracted judicial confession which even according
to High Court was not corroborated by any other
independent evidence and was disbelieved---No
illegality, misreading or non-appreciation of
evidence warranting interference by
Supreme Court could be pointed out---
Impugned judgment acquitting the accused had
been passed after duly appraising the entire
evidence collected by the prosecution---Leave to
appeal was refused accordingly.

27. The entire facts and circumstances discussed above
in reference to the judgments of apex Court, it is held that all
these cases of conviction are the cases of no evidence and based
on malice of facts and law. The way all the convicts have been
proceeded right from their arrest, from different part of the
country, in the custody of the agencies and landing them in the
Internment Centers for months / years, are not appreciated at all
for the purpose of convictions. Therefore, we while exercising
our powers of Judicial Review in the light of the referred
judgments of the apex Court, accept all the writ petitions, set
aside the impugned convictions & sentences, being based on
malice in law and facts, as well and resultantly, respondents are
directed to set free all the convicts / internee, if not required in

any other case.
