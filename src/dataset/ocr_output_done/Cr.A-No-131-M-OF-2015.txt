Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
connected Cr.R No. 30-M/2015 as both these
matters emanate from one and the same
judgment dated 28.05.2015 rendered by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla
Qazi, Chakdara, Camp Court Timergara,
District Dir Lower in case F.I.R No. 636 dated
21.09.2013 under Section 302 PPC registered
at Police Station Khall, District Dir Lower
whereby the appellant was convicted under
Section 302 (c) PPC and sentenced to fourteen
(14) years simple imprisonment with payment
of rupees one million as compensation to legal
heirs of the deceased under Section 544-A,
Cr.P.C or in default thereof he was ordered to
undergo further six months S.I.

2. Abstract of the prosecution case
as set out in the first information report is that
on 21.09.2013 ASI Bakhtiar Khan of Police
Station Khall received information regarding
murder in Bila. For confirmation he rushed to
the spot where he found the dead body of a
young boy namely Afsar Ali alias Sheno son

of Bakht Zamin. Mujahid Khan, brother of the

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
deceased, who was present with the dead body
reported to the local police that the deceased
was dealing in tyre? vulcanizing at Khall
Bazaar. He went out of his house on
20.09.2013 at evening time by saying that he
has received a phone call from someone and is
going to meet him and will return, however,
he did not return till the next morning. The
complainant further reported that today (on the
day of report) he came to know through his
villagers that a dead body is lying in the fields
near hospital Kooz Kalay Bila. When he
rushed to the spot he found the dead body of
his brother Afsar Ali who had been done to
death by some unknown accused by causing
firearm injuries at his neck, eye and head. The
complainant while reporting the matter further
stated that neither he nor his deceased brother
had any enmity with anyone and may be the
occurrence have been witnessed by someone.
He charged unknown accused for the murder
of his brother. It is noteworthy that later on
correction was made in the name of deceased

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
from Afsar Ali to Afsar Zamin Khan vide
Ex.PW-13/6.

3. The ASI named above (PW-11)
reduced the report of complainant into
Murasila (Ex.PA/1). He also prepared injury
sheet/inquest report of the deceased
(Ex.PW11/1 & Ex.PW-11/2) and sent the
Murasila through Constable Azimullah No.
2325 to police station hall where
Muhammad Ibrar Muharrir (PW-10) chalked
out F.I.R (Ex.PA) by incorporating therein the
contents of Murasila.

4. The task of investigation in the
case was entrusted to Bagh-e-Haram S.I
(PW-13) who prepared the site plan (Ex.PB)
on pointation of complainant, collected blood-
stained earth from the place of presence of
deceased vide recovery memo (Ex.PW-2/1)
and collected two empty shells vide recovery
memo (Ex.PW-2/2). He also took into
possession the blood stained garments of
deceased vide recovery memo (Ex.PW-2/3)
whereas through recovery memo (Ex.PW-2/4)

Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
he took into possession packing of Nokia
mobile phone. Vide application (Ex.PW-13/5)
the I.O sought CDR data of the accused and
the report in this regard was placed on file as
Ex.PW-13/8.

4. On 02.10.2013, Bakht Zamin
Khan and Mujahid Khan (complainant), father
and brother of the deceased respectively
recorded their statements under Section 164,
Cr.P.C wherein they charged Zahir Rehman,
the present appellant, for the murder of Afsar
Zamin Khan who was arrested by local police
on the same day. The I.O allegedly recovered
the crime weapon on pointation of the accused
and took the same into possession vide
recovery memo (Ex.PW-13/15). Likewise the
crime empties as well as the crime weapon
were sent to F.S.L and positive report thereof
was placed on file as Ex.PW-13/24.

3: Investigation in the case was
completed whereafter complete challan was
submitted in Court for trial of the accused. On
30.11.2013, the learned trial Court formally

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaqg Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
indicted the appellant for the offence to which
he pleaded not guilty and opted to face the
trial. Prosecution produced and examined as
many as thirteen witnesses and closed its
evidence whereafter statement of the accused
under Section 342, Cr.P.C was recorded
wherein he denied the allegations leveled by
prosecution. In response to the offer made by
the trial Court, the accused did not opt either
to produce evidence in his defence or to record
his own statement on oath in terms of Section
340(2), Cr.P.C. At the conclusion of the trial,
the accused was convicted and sentenced as
mentioned earlier, hence, this appeal. The
complainant, being aggrieved of the lesser
punishment awarded to the appellant, has filed
Cr.R No. 30-M/2015 seeking enhancement in
the sentence.

6. Learned counsel for the
appellant, inter alia, contended that the
impugned judgment regarding conviction of
the appellant is against law, facts on record
and provisions of Juvenile Justice System

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
Ordinance, 2000. That there is no direct
evidence against the appellant and the trial
Court has relied only upon circumstantial
pieces of evidence of unsafe nature in the form
of CDR data, alleged confessional statement
of the convict and recovery of pistol. Further
contended that the learned trial Court has
wrongly associated the CDR data with the
appellant as he was minor and student of 3"
Class having no identity card at the time of the
alleged occurrence, hence, the prosecution has
badly failed to prove that the SIM was
registered in the name of the appellant.
Learned counsel added that in fact the
appellant has made no confession at all
because at the time of recording his statement
the appellant was a juvenile and was afforded
no opportunity of consultation with his
parents/guardian or a counsel before recording
his confessional statement under the Juvenile
Justice Ordinance, hence, the same having no
evidentiary value cannot be used against the
appellant. Learned counsel maintained that the

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
pistol allegedly recovered from an open room
which was not in the exclusive use of the
appellant, as such, the alleged recovery of
pistol is highly doubtful. That there are
material contradictions in the statements of
prosecution evidence which have totally been
ignored by the learned trial Court while
convicting the appellant. That the prosecution
has badly failed to prove the guilt of the
appellant beyond shadow of reasonable doubt
and while ignoring this aspect of the case, the
learned trial Court has deviated from the well
settled principles of criminal justice. Learned
counsel submitted that conviction and
sentence of the appellant be set aside by
allowing this appeal.

Zz As against that learned counsel
for the complainant argued that the appellant
has confessed his guilt before the competent
Court and his statement is duly corroborated
by other circumstantial evidence available on
the record, therefore, the learned trial Court
has rightly convicted him in accordance with

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
law. Further contended that sufficient
trustworthy and convincing evidence is
available on the record which proves the guilt
of the appellant beyond any doubt, hence, the
prosecution is successful in discharging its
burden. Learned counsel maintained that the
learned trial Court has properly appreciated
the prosecution evidence and convicted the
appellant through a well-reasoned judgment
the legality whereof cannot be questioned in
on any ground whatsoever. He requested that
this appeal, having no merits, be dismissed
and the sentence awarded to the appellant be
enhanced in accordance with law.

8. Learned Assistant Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State
followed the arguments of learned counsel for
the complainant and contended that the
appellant being convicted for the brutal
murder of an innocent person, is not entitled to

any concession.

9. We have gone through the record

in the light of valuable assistance of learned
counsel for the parties as well learned A.A.G.
10. Before proceeding further with
this judgment, we deem it appropriate to give
detail of the injuries on the body of the
deceased as observed by Dr. Muhammad
Kamil Khan, Medical Officer, D.H.Q Hospital
Timergara (PW-9) who examined the dead
body and prepared his report as Ex.PM. The
detail of wounds is as under:-

i) An entry wound penetrating and
destroying right eye globe. The exit
wound is on right occipital area.

ii) One entry wound with charring
circular ring is present on right side of
neck.

Rigor mortis and signs of levidity fully
developed. Mazzal brought out by a deep
cut on left lateral neck and bullet found
behind vertebral column. Mazzal and
report handed over to A.S.I Bakhtiar Khan
No. 106, P.S Khall.

Duration of death and injury is about 10-18

hours.

No other signs of violence found”.

il. Admittedly, the occurrence is
unseen one and the prosecution case mainly
hinges on confessional statement
(Ex.PW-12/2) recorded by the appellant

before the Judicial Magistrate, recovery of

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
=1ls

pistol and report of F.S.L qua the two empties
collected from the spot and C.D.R data
brought on the record.

12. While framing formal charge
against the accused, his age was mentioned by
the trial Court as 16/17 years. Admittedly, the
appellant was minor and that is why he was
tried under the Juvenile Justice System
Ordinance, 2000, a special law enforced in
order to safeguard the rights of children/
minors and to provide for their protection and
rehabilitation in the society. The question
before this Court is as to whether the Judicial
Magistrate has carefully recorded the
confessional statement of the appellant who
was admittedly a minor at that time. In the
present case, the trial Court has mainly relied
on circumstantial evidence and in the
circumstances of the case, the trial Court was
under the obligation to consider each and
every aspect of the confessional statement for
getting the satisfaction as to whether all the
formalities have been complied with or not. It

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
. (0-

is well settled that before recording
confessional statement of an accused, the
Judicial Magistrate should essentially observe
all the mandatory precautions as per High
Court Rules and Procedure so that all signs of
fear inculcated by the investigating agency in
the mind of the accused are to be shed out.
Reliance is placed on the case titled “Azeem

Khan_and_another V/s. Mujahid Khan_and

others” (2016 SCMR 274). But we see no
such precautionary measures in the present
case which, in the circumstances of the case,
were pre-requisite for recording the confession
of a minor.

13. Before this Court is the case of a
minor who has mainly been convicted on the
basis of his judicial confession, therefore,
extra ordinary care and caution was required
to have been taken by the concerned Judicial
Magistrate before recording his confessional
statement. Record shows that the appellant
was arrested on 02.10.2013 and produced

before the Judicial Magistrate on 03.10.2013.

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)

The appellant, being a minor, was provided no
opportunity of counseling neither by his
guardian nor by a lawyer rather his confession
was recorded in presence of Naib Court who
was duly uniformed at that time. It was
desirable in the interest of justice that the
appellant, being a juvenile, should have been
provided counseling facility of guardian or a
lawyer of his choice but no such opportunity
has been afforded to him by the Judicial
Magistrate before recording his confessional
statement. Reliance in this regard is placed on
the judgment of the apex Court in the case
titled “Hashim Qasim and another V/s. The
State” (2017 SCMR 986).

In cross-examination, the Judicial
Magistrate (PW-12) stated that the appellant
refused when he asked him to have a meeting
with his counsel but no such question and
answer is available in the questionnaire. There
is no other independent source from which the
above assertion of the Judicial Magistrate
could be ascertained, hence, we have on other

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
=14s

option but to presume that no offer was made
to the appellant for counseling. Even during
the time given to the appellant for thinking,
the Judicial Magistrate afforded him no
opportunity to be alone rather he remained
sitting on the dice alongwith the Judicial
Magistrate during the said period of half an
hour for deliberation. Admittedly, the offence
with which the appellant has been charged
entails capital punishment and keeping in
view the intensity of the charge on one hand
and minority of the appellant on the other, the
Judicial Magistrate ought to be extra-cautious
while recording the confessional statement of
a minor as the same statement could be used
for his conviction at trial stage. Reliance is
placed on the case of “Abdul Haleem V/s. The
State” (1984 P Cr.L J (Karachi) 611)
wherein it was held that:-

© sess Accordingly we are inclined to
agree with the view that the accused of
his age could easily be duped to give
statement as was tutored to him by the
police. In the case of this nature, the
learned magistrate had to be extra-
cautious in recording the confession of
the accused of his age. He had to make
sure that accused had given the

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
« 15-

confessional statement under absolute
freedom, without any pressure or
coercion having been brought to bear
upon him for giving the said statement”.

14. Perusal of the confessional
statement further reveals that Question No. 13
was put before the appellant which is
reproduced alongwith reply of the appellant
for convenience.
Set S PZ IPI Kyrie (ir
UKE IZ

The answer given to the above
question by the appellant on its face appears to
be irrational and indicates that the appellant
was not in a position to give reasonable
answers to the questions of the Judicial
Magistrate. The Judicial Magistrate has also
admitted this fact in his cross examination that
the appellant did not disclose any reason for
recording his confessional statement. The
logic behind such question is to bring forth
many clues regarding truth or voluntariness of
confessional statement but from the above
answer of the appellant it cannot be

ascertained whether the confession was

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
= 16 =

voluntarily made or otherwise. In this regard
we would refer the judgment rendered by this
Court in case titled “Murtaza and two others
V/s. State” (PLJ 1996 Cr.C (Peshawar) 371)
wherein it was held that:-

esiaysiee In the circumstances, it is
not believable that the accused
would make a confession in the
normal course. Obviously a
question would arise in the mind
of the Court as to why at all the
accused were going to make a
confession. Such question was
never asked by the _ learned
Magistrate before recording the
confessional statement. An answer
to such question can _ provide
many clues regarding the truth or
voluntariness of the confessional
statements. No such question is
asked”.

In the present case though the
same question was asked from the appellant
but his reply is quite ambiguous, as such, the
very purpose for which the question was asked
could not be achieved and so voluntariness of
the appellant qua his judicial confession
appears highly improbable in the given
circumstances.

15. Confession of a minor is to be

assessed on the same touchstone as to that of

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
=17 =

statement of a child witness rather child
witness is brought to the dock by relatives
while on the contrary child accused is brought
to the Court by police officials for recording
his confessional statement where possibility of
tutoring and police fear is always there.
Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case
of “State through Advocate General, Sindh
Karachi_V/s. Farman Hussain _and_others”.
(PLD 1995 Supreme Court 1).

Whether the appellant was able to
understand the nature of questions put to him
by the Judicial Magistrate or otherwise, in this
regard an example of answer given by the
appellant to Question No.13 has already been
given in the preceding para from which it can
easily be assessed that the appellant was not
able to understand the nature of the questions
or to give rational answers thereof. This Court
while deciding the case of “Abdul Hamid V/s.
The State” (PLD 1980 Peshawar 25)
observed that :-

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
-18-

* .eseeeebesides the other
discrepancies in their statements,
one thing is very significant and it
suggests very strongly that though
they are disinterested witnesses
yet because of their tender age,
they were positively under the
influence of the Investigating
Agency. This we say so because
unless they were tutored either by
the Investigating Agency or by
their elders they could not have
possibly stated that the accused
was armed with a rifle and has
used the same in the commission
of the offence”.

16. In the circumstances when utmost
care is to be taken while assessing the
testimony of a child witness, on the same
yardstick extraordinary care and caution
should have been taken by the Judicial
Magistrate while recording the confessional
statement of the appellant and the learned trial
Court as well by evaluating his such statement
for his conviction especially when the offence
carries capital punishment. It appears from the
printed questionnaire form that the Judicial
Magistrate filled the answers by adopting a
stereotypical way without adhering to the
codal formalities and without considering the

intellectual level of the minor who was

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
-19-

unaware of the consequences of his statement.
Likewise, the possibility of the appellant,
being minor, to have been tutored or tortured
by the local police before recording his
confessional statement cannot be ruled out
especially when no opportunity of counseling
by parents or a lawyer was afforded to him.
By considering the above facts and
circumstances regarding the judicial
confession of the appellant, we feel no
hesitation in holding that the requisite care and
vigilence has been taken neither by the
Judicial | Magistrate before recording
confessional statement of the appellant nor by
the trial Court when he was convicting him on
the basis of the same statement, hence, it
would be highly unsafe to rely upon the
confessional statement of the appellant for
maintaining his conviction.

17. Coming to corroborative
evidence in shape of alleged recovery of pistol
on pointation of the appellant. Record shows
that the pistol has been recovered from a room

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
-20-

(hall) of the house clung to a wooden
pillar. This room was jointly used by all the
inmates of the house and was not in the
exclusive use/control of the appellant. Moreso,
no independent witness was associated with
the alleged recovery. The application for
opinion of the arms expert regarding the crime
weapon and the empty shells was made on
02.10.2013 but the same received to F.S.L on
11.10.2013 though prior to that there was an
application for verification of the empties as to
whether the same were fired from one or
different weapons. There is nothing on the
record to explain that why the above
incriminating articles were retained for 9 days
and the prosecution has not bothered to
examine the person who took the parcel to
F.S.L or Muharrir of the police station who
might have kept the same in his custody.
Moreso, the contents of F.S.L report (Ex.PW-
13/24) and that of the application for opinion
of arms expert (Ex.PW-12/17) are
contradictory. As per prosecution version, the

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
= 2 =

crime empties had already been sent to F.S.L
and were still there in safe custody till
recovery of the pistol but according to the
F.S.L report both the pistol and the crime
empties were received to the laboratory on
11.10.2013 as there is no explanation in the
said report that the crime empties were already
available there. Thus, not only the recovery is
doubtful but the status of the F.S.L report has
also become suspicious in view of the above
mentioned unexplained delay as well as
contradictions inter se the F.S.L report and
application moved by local police to the lab,
hence, the same is of no use to the
prosecution.

18. Adverting to the other evidence
in the shape of C.D.R data, it is not clear as to
whether the telephone/SIM number was in the
name of the appellant as the same fact has not
been established through record. Even
assuming that the last call was made by the
appellant to the deceased that may be for any
other reason and not for the offence, therefore,

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
2°99)

just by placing mobile data on the record

would hardly be of any use to the prosecution.

19. The above discrepancies in the
prosecution evidence not only create serious
and reasonable doubts in prudent mind the
benefit of which must go the accused, being a
well cherished principle of criminal justice but
the same have further obscured the retracted
confessional statement of the appellant. It is
settled principle of law that conviction cannot
be based only on the confessional statement of
the accused unless the prosecution is able to
substantiate its case against the accused by
trustworthy and inspiring evidence which is
not available in the present case. Even
otherwise, the confession here in this case
being retracted one which is not corroborated
by the other oral as well as circumstantial
evidence on the record, hence, the same
cannot be used for conviction of the accused.
Reliance is placed on the judgment in the case
titled Muhammad Ismail and others V/s. The
State (2017 SCMR 898) the Superior Court

held that:-

Tajamul/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 131-M of 2015 Zahir Rahman Vs. The State and one other)
-23-

“The only other piece of evidence
remaining in the field was a
judicial confession allegedly made
by Muhammad [Iqrar, Khalid
Hussain and Shakir Ali appellants
before a Magistrate under Section
164, Cr.P.C. but admittedly the
said judicial confession had been
retracted by the appellants before
the trial Court and in the absence
of any independent corroboration
such retracted judicial confession
could not suffice all by itself for
recording or upholding the
appellants’ convictions”.

20. In the backdrop of the above
discussion, the learned trial Court has failed to
properly analyze the prosecution evidence
especially the confessional statement of the
appellant according to the principles laid
down by the Superior Courts, therefore, this
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment
dated 28.05.2015 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge Juvenile Court,
Chakdara at Camp Court Timergara, Dir
Lower is set aside and the appellant-convict
Zahir Rahman son of Muhammad Rahman is
acquitted of the charge in case F.I.R No. 636
