Judgment Sheet

IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, PESHAWAR

JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Cr.M/BA NO. 1023-P/2017

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 2.6.2017
Petitioner: (Shehnaz) by Mr. Umer Zafran, Advocate.

Respondents (The State) by Mian Arshad Jan, AAG.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.- Accused-petitioner, | Shehnaz

W/o Inayatullah, seeks bail in case FIR No. 1174 dated

24.9.2016 under Section 302 PPC registered at Police Station

Bhana Mari, Peshawar. She has been refused bail by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge-VI, Peshawar vide order dated

5.5.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same purpose.

2. The order sheet dated 25.5.2017 of Deputy

Registrar of this Court is revealed that notice was issued to

respondent No.2, which has been returned with the report that

he is residing in Chitral, however, he was served through his

Cell Phone No. 0345-1114882 but none turned up; hence, the

case was placed before the Court for today.
3. Arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as learned Additional Advocate General were heard and

record of the case was perused.

4. Perusal of the record would reveal that initially,

Latifullah, complainant lodged a report vide Naqal Mad No. 57

dated 19.9.2016 regarding the murder of his sister/cousin Mst.

Amara, who was murdered by giving her poison, and no body

was charged. After receiving post mortem report, on 26.9.2016,

the complainant recorded his statement under Section 164

Cr.P.C. and charged the present accused-petitioner along with

her husband Inayatullah for the commission of offence, which

fact was further supported by Iqrar-ud-Din, brother of deceased,

in his statement recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. on

1.10.2016. No doubt, the accused-petitioner is charged for the

murder of Mst. Amara but there is suckling baby with the

accused-petitioner, who is behind the bars for more than one

and a half months and three other children outside the jail and at

this stage, the welfare of the minors will be taken into account.

It is an admitted fact that the punishment provided for the

offence is death etc, which falls within the prohibitory clause of
Section 497(1) Cr.P.C. and the accused-petitioner cannot be

released on bail but there is suckling baby inside the jail, who is

undoubtedly innocent and is kept in jail with the

mother/accused-petitioner for his welfare and three other

children outside the jail. The concept of ‘welfare of minor’ is

incompatible with jail life. So, instead of detaining the innocent

child infant in the jail for the crime allegedly committed by his

mother/accused-petitioner, it would be in the interest of justice

as well as welfare of the children if the mother is released from

jail. In the famous case of Ghamidiyyah, our Holy Prophet

Muhammad (P.B.U.H) had suspended the sentence of pregnant

woman, not only till delivery of the child but also postponed it

till suckling period i.e. two years, obviously for the welfare of

the child. This shows the paramount important and significance

of the right of a suckling baby in Islam and the unprecedented

care taken of, and the protection given to a child or expected to

be born, by our Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H). This

golden principle of administration of justice enunciated by the

Holy Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) must be strictly observed

and followed in our country.
5. The above said basic principle has been followed

by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Mst. Nusrat vs. The

State (1996 SCMR 973) and the Hon’ble Lahore High Court in

the case of Sadiq Waqas vs. The State and another_ (2012

PCr.LJ 841). Since the petitioner having suckling baby inside

the jail and three other children outside the jail, therefore, she

should not be kept in jail and the superior Courts had been

pleased to grant bail in such situation.

6. In view of the above, this bail application is

accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided

she furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four

lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure

that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

7. Above are the reasons of my short order of even
date.

Announced. JUDGE
