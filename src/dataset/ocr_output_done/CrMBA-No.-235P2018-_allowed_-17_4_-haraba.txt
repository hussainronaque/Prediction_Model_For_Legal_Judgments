JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 19.03.2018
Petitioner: Masaud
vs

Respondent: The State etc

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.- Petitioner, Masaud son
of Ismail, seeks his post arrest bail in case F.I.R. No. 01 dated
01.01.2017 under Sections 17(4) Offences Against Property
(Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 read with Sections
458/459/460/109 PPC registered at Police Station Badaber,
Peshawar. He has been refused bail by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Peshawar vide order dated 26.01.2018;

hence, the instant petition for the same purpose.

2. As per contents of F.I.R. on 01.01.2017 at 0400
hours, complainant Attaullah in injured condition at Casualty,
LRH Peshawar reported the matter to the local police to the
effect that on the fateful night at 0100 hours, he along with his

wife Mst. Ambareen, was present in the room of their house
-2-

situated at Bazid Khel stop, in the meanwhile, they heard some

commotion in the courtyard of the house. Complainant and his

wife opened the door of the room and found four armed

persons present in the courtyard of the house. One of the

accused started firing at the complainant and his wife, as a

result of which, they hit and severely injured. Wife of the

complainant succumbed to her injuries and died on the spot;

thus, the instant FIR was registered against unknown accused.

Subsequently, on 09.02.2017, complainant

Attaullah recorded his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C.

and charged the present petitioner along with others for the

commission of offence.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Admittedly, the petitioner has not been charged in

the F.I.R. rather he has been nominated by co-accused

Rahatullah in his statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. on

31.01.2017 and subsequently, complainant Attaullah in his

statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. on 09.02.2017. It is also

an admitted fact that in the F.I.R. the complainant had shown
-3-
four persons present in the courtyard of his house but while
recording his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C., he charged
six (06) persons for the commission of offence. Similarly, co-
accused of the petitioner, namely, Niaz Muhammad alias
Nakoo recorded his confessional statement and narrated the
entire story but does not disclose the name of petitioner
regarding his participation in the commission of offence.
Moreover, the petitioner remained in police custody for
sufficient time but nothing has been recovered/discovered from
his possession. Petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest.
Investigation in the case is complete and the petitioner is no
more required for further investigation and keeping him behind
the bars would serve no useful purpose.

5. As far as the abscondence of petitioner is
concerned, it has been settled law that mere abscondence is no
ground to decline the bail, if the case of an accused is
otherwise found fit for bail on merits and the bail cannot be
refused even if he had remained an absconder. Reliance can be
placed on the cases of State v. Malik Mukhtiar Ahmed

(1991 SCMR 322) and Mitho Pitafi versus The State (2009
-4-

SCMR 299). Thus, keeping in view the above facts and

circumstances of case, this Court is inclined to extend the

concession of bail to the petitioner.

6. Resultantly, this bail petition is allowed and the

accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes

bail bond in the sum of Rs. 4,00,000/- (Rs. Four lacs) with two

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

Illaqa/Duty Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties are

local, reliable and men of means.

7. Above are the reasons of my short order of even

date.
