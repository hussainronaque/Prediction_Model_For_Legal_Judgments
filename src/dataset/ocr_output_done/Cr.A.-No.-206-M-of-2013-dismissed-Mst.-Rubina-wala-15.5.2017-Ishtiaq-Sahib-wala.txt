4. At the end after closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused/Respondent was examined under
section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein she denied the charges,
posed innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case. She however wished to
produce no defence, not to examine herself on oath
as required under section 340(2), Cr.P.C.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi 1° Swat
acquitted the accused/Respondent Mst. Robina
Guvenile) from the charges of murder levelled
against her through the judgment impugned herein.
6. Having heard arguments of the learned
counsel for the complainant/Appellant, learned
counsel for the accused/Respondent and learned
A.A.G, record gone through with their valuable
assistance.

7. Learned counsel for the
complainant/Appellant though did not rely any

dictum of the Hon’ble superior Courts, however
Nawab

-8-

vehemently argued the case of his client ie.

complainant by submitting that heinous offence has

been attributed to the accused/Respondent Mst.

Rubina due to which a young lady has lost her life in

brutal manner. On the other hand, learned counsel

for the accused/Respondent referred to 1997 P Cr.LJ

113 (Lahore) “ Afgaal Hussain Shah vs the State”,

2013 YLR 230 (Lahore) “ Bakht Zada vs the State”,

2013 P_ Cr. LJ 708 (Peshawar) “ Umer Zaman ys

the State” and 2014 P Cr. LJ 611 (Sindh) “ Qazi

alias Dost Muhammad and another vs the State”

and prayed for the dismissal of the appeal out-rightly

being shorn of merits.

8. Although the requirement was that this

being a juvenile trial under Juvenile Justice System,

the trial was to be conducted exclusively by

recording statements of the prosecution witnesses,

yet the learned Trial Court has recorded statements

of all the prosecution PWs in verbatim form as the

trial of the co-accused in Sessions Case No. 31/7
Nawab

-9.

of the year 2012 was also under trial side by side.

Thus when the allegations as per report of the

complainant Mst. Tahira are taken up for

consideration, deposition in her report that she was

in the wedlock of one Saba Khan. Out of their

wedlock the spouses were blessed with one male

child Asmat Ali. Later the relationship became

strained and she opted to live in the house of her

parents. Her husband Saba Khan made several

attempts in person as well as through Jirga to bring

her back to her house and finally after hectic efforts

on behalf of the husband Saba Khan she came to the

house of her husband on 07.08.2012. When on

11.03.2012 she being present in her house alongwith

her husband Saba Khan and her son, who at that time

was listening songs through mobile when she came

outside her room and opened the door someone else

not named, thrown something on her body and due to

darkness of the night she could not identify anyone.

However she is in doubt that her mother-in-law
Nawab

-10-

Mst. Taj Bibi and sister-in-law Mst. Rubina had

thrown acid upon her body. She was severely injured

due to acid burns and became unconscious. She was

brought to the casualty hospital by her husband and

inmates of the house. Because of the strained

relationship mother-in-law and sister-in-law are

suspected, therefore for the offence Mst. Robina

alongwith other co-accused have been charged in the

present case.

9. It is obviously happening of an untoward

incident happened in the house of the complainant

Mst. Tahira at /sha time, there was no one in the

house except inmates. According to her own words

of Mst. Tahira, the acid was thrown upon her which

resulted into burns on her body, but this fact in the

statements of the Medical Officers has been totally

negated. All Medical Officers whether that be PW-1

Dr. Manzoor Ali member of the Medical Board

constituted on 20.04.2012, PW-3 Dr. Mir Alam

Afridi who is Associate Professor of Forensic
Nawab

-ll-

Science Saidu Group of Teaching Hospital and is a

senior lecturer as well as PW-6 Lady Doctor

Shaukat Haider Ali who has examined the injured

Mst. Tahira. It is by all such evidence through

medical experts that the burns on the body of Mst.

Tahira were caused by Thermal and not acidic burns.

The burns were 1-2 months old with scab formation

over the wounds and quick remedies (Hakeem's

powder) were applied on it which has masked the

identification features further. The statement of Lady

Doctor Shaukat Haider Ali who has conducted

postmortem of the deceased has also given her

opinion as member of the Medical Board alongwith

other medical experts which too is not in line with

the version of the prosecution. So by all

probabilities accused/Respondent who has _ been

acquitted of the charges levelled against her to be a

young girl of 17 years has only been charged on

account of suspicion of the relationship with the

deceased Mst. Tahira being her sister-in-law (2).

10. Rest of the findings contained in the

judgment of learned trial Court being rendered in

accordance with settled principles of criminal

administration of justice are not open to any

exception, as there are reasons to believe that such

findings are based on proper appreciation of the

medical evidence and other material brought by the

prosecution on the record.

11. The cardinal principle of justice always

laid emphasis on the quality of evidence which must

be of first degree in quality and shall be sufficient

enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court with

regard to the implication of innocent persons

alongwith guilty one by the prosecution. The golden

principle of justice would come into play that even a

single doubt if found reasonable would be sufficient

for the acquittal of accused, giving him/them benefit

of doubt, because bundle of doubts is not required to

be extended to the accused in this regard. Reliance is

placed on a view held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
Nawab

-13-

in the case of Muhammad Shafi vs. Muhammad Raza and

another (2008 SCMR 329).

12. Above all, there is no cavil to the

proposition that the scope of interference in appeal

against acquittal is most narrow and limited because in

case of acquittal the presumption of innocence is

significantly added to the cardinal rule of criminal

jurisprudence that an accused shall be presumed to be

innocent unless proved guilty. Simple is that the

presumption of innocence is doubled and the Courts

shall be very slow in interfering with such an acquittal

judgment, unless it is shown to be perverse, based on

gross violation of law, suffering from the errors of

grave misreading or non-reading of the evidence. Such

judgments should not be usually interfered and heavy

burden lies on the prosecution to rebut the presumption

of innocence which the accused has earned and

attained on account of his acquittal. Reliance is placed

on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
Nawab

-14-

in the case of "Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. State"

(N LR 1995 Cr.SC 694).

13. After reappraisal of evidence, evaluation

of record in view of above discussion and criteria

laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, this court

does not propose to draw a different conclusion from

what the learned trial Court has drawn, thus we

uphold the acquittal of the accused/Respondent,

ergo, maintain the impugned judgment and

accordingly dismissed the appeal in hand being

shorn of merits.
