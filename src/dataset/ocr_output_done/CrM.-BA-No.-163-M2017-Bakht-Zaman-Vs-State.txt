ABDUL SHAKOOR., J: Accused-petitioner arter

having refused the concession of bail in case FIR No.8)
dated 24.03.2017, which was registered at police station
Gandigar, District Dir Upper under sections 337-A
(1/337 A Gii)-337-F (1334 PPC by the fora below. now
seeks the concession of bail from this court.

2. The prosecution case as per FIR which was
lodged on the basis of daily diary No.7 dated 17.3.2017
are that) Muhammad Sultan Ahmad complainant
alongwith his brothers on 47.03.2017 at about 6:30
hours reached to the fields owned by them situated at
place known as Nangaro Nala, wherein accused’
petitioner and his brother Imran have made a field
(adai). When they were dismantling the walls in the

said field suddenly the accused/petitioner and his
te

brother Imran who was duly armed with rifle emerged
at the scene and started pelting stone at complainant
party. As a result of which complainant got injured on
sain and right thigh which caused pain in his whole
body, whereas his brother Anwar gol injured on right
thigh, foot and left leg and brother Ghulamullah got
injured on right foot, ankle and left leg. Accused Imran
has also resorted to firing from his rifle.

3. It was argued by the learned counsel for
petitioner that complainant in FIR has not attributed the

'

allegations of nasal injury to petitioner but medical
report shows thal amongst other injuries petitioner nose
was also [ractured. This shows that there is a clear cut
conflict between the FIR and medical report, thus
require further inquiry into the alleged guilt of
petitioner. Due to that allegations accused/petitioner
amongst other was booked under section 337-A (i)
PPC. He further argued that except the accusation of

nasal fracture no other fetal injury is caused ta

petitioner. Petitioner is neither previous convict nor is

habitual, hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal. In

this regard he further stated that now: it is well settled
through the interpretation of superior courts that in all

cases provided for in Chapter XVI PPC the normal
punishment to be awarded to an offender is payment of
‘Arsh’ and Daman and the optional punishment of
imprisonment as Tazeer’ provided for the relevant
offence can be awarded to an offender only where he js
previous convict, habitual, hardened or dangerous
criminal or the offence has been committed by him in
the name of honour and in the case of such offender, the
sentence of imprisonment as ‘Tazeer’ is not to be less
than 1/3” of the maximum imprisonment provided for
the hurt caused. Being a case of further inquiry, the
petitioner is entitled to the concession of bail.

4. The learned State counse] assisted by
Mr.Mugqadar Khan, Advocate learned counsel for the
complainant vehemently argued that accused/petitioner
in view of the injury caused to the complainant is not
entitled for the concession of bail. As, his that act is an
offence under section 337-A (iii) (Shaja-e-Hashmia)
whereunder the maximum imprisonment is ten years.

5. I have given serious thought to the contention
of learned counsel for the accused/petitioner as well as
the learned State counsel, No doubt, accused/petitioner
according to medical report, inter alia, was charged
under section 337-4 (iil) PPC for causing nasal fracture

to the complainant, but it is ironical that complainant
¥

has not remotely attributed the accusation of nasal
injury/fracture in his statement which reduced into FIR.
This means medical report is in direct conflict with the
allegation contained in the FIR. Case of accused:
petitioner, thus, requires further inquiry into the alleged
guilt of petitioner. It is also noticed by this court that
medical officer has opined that petitioner was having
nasal fracture but there is no X-Ray film on the record
to support such opinion. The case against the
accused/petitioner require further probe on this count as
well. Further, the trial of the case has not been
commenced as vet,

In view of above circumstances and the fact
that trial is yet to take some time to commence, further
detention of accused petitioner Bakht Zameen would
not serve any useful purpose and it would be in fitness
of things that he be released on bail. This application is
allowed and the petitioner is directed to be released on
bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the like amount
lo the satisfaction of the leamed trial court, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of

means.
a

Above are the reasons for my earlier short order

of even date.
