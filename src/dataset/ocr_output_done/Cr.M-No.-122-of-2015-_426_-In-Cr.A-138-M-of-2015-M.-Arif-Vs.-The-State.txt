Cr.M No. 122/2015
In Cr.A No. 138-M/2015

Present: Mr. Sher Muhammad Khan, Advocate for the

petitioner/appellant.

Mr. Sabir Shah, A.A.G. for the State.

KKK

HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- Through the instant Cr.M
under section 426, Cr.P.C the petitioner/convict seeks
suspension of life sentence awarded to him by the trial
Court and his release on bail till final disposal of the
main appeal.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner referred to
Paragraph 9 of Shari Nizam-e-Adal Regulation, 2009 and
contended that under the Islamic law only legal heirs of a
deceased are entitled to charge a person for the murder of
their predecessor but in the present case neither the
deceased then injured Shah Zamin nor his legal heirs
have charged the present petitioner/convict for his
murder. In this regard the learned counsel also referred to

Verse No.35 of Sura Bani-Israiel and further contended

Tajamul

that “Sultan” mentioned in the verse means a person who
is legally authorized to charge or pardon. The learned
counsel concluded that in view of the prevailing legal
position, the petitioner/convict is entitled to the
concession of bail till disposal of his appeal.

3. On the other hand, the learned A.A.G.
contended that the petitioner/convict has been convicted
by a competent Court after proper appraisal of evidence
and the present case does not come within the ambit of
any of the parameters mentioned in section 426, Cr.P.C,

therefore, the present application is liable to be

dismissed.

4. Arguments heard and available record
perused.

5. Admittedly, the accused was 15/16 years of

age at the time of the commission of the offence who all
along remained on bail until conclusion of the trial and
he was tried as juvenile offender by the trial Court under
the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance. Record shows
that two separate FIRs were registered regarding the
same occurrence. This Court considers application of the
petitioner on the grounds firstly taht one FIR bearing
No.49 was lodged by Mst. Gulshan Bibi against the

deceased Shah Zamin and his two sons Shakil Ahmad

Tajamul

and the present petitioner/convict Muhamamd Arif.
Shakil Ahmad absconding co-accused was given the role
of effective firing at her husband Muslim Khan whereas
the present petitioner/convict Muhammad Arif was given
the role of firing at his father Shah Zamin. Secondly, that
the second FIR No.50 was registered by the deceased
then injured Shah Zamin (father of the petitioner/convict)
against Muhammad Salim. A bare reading of FIR No. 50
reveals that the deceased Shah Zamin while lodging the
FIR, did not charge the present petitioner/convict for
attempting at his life. He later on succumbed to his
injuries and died.

6. Thirdly, the record shows that the main
appeal was fixed for 03.7.2015 and notice was issued to
the other side for today. Widow, major daughter and
father of the deceased Shah Zamin (mother, sister and
grandfather of the petitioner) are present before the Court
and stated that they never charged the petitioner/convict
for the murder of their predecessor rather he was charged
by the complainant Mst. Gulshan Bibi in cross FIR
No. 49 for firing at his own father. This version stands
belied by the the complainant Shah Zamin then injured
who did not utter a single word regarding any role of the

present petitioner/convict in his FIR No.50. Fourthly, that

Tajamul

in this backdrop the learned trial Court passed conviction
on the petitioner/convict for life imprisonment under
section 302(b) PPC as ‘Tazir’ in disregard of the sharia
law as envisaged by Paragraph 9(1) of the Shari Nizam-
e-Adl Regulation, 2009, according to which a Qazi is
required to seek guidance form Quran, Sunnah and Figah
for conduct and resolution of cases. For convenience sake
the Paragaraph 9(1) of the Regulation ibid is reproduced

herein below:-

6

9. Proceedings to be in accordance with
Shariah.----(1) A Qazi or _ Executive

Magistrate shall seeks guidance from Quarn
Majeed, Sunnah-e-Nabwi (Sallallaho Alaihe
Wasallam), jam and Qiyas for the purposes
of procedure and proceedings for conduct and
resolution of cases and shall decide the same
in accordance with Shariah. While
expounding and interpreting the Quran
Majeed, Sunnah-e-Nabwi (Sallaho Aliahe
Wassallam) the Qazi and _ Executive
Magistrate shall follow the established
principles of exposition and interpretation of
Quran Majeed, Sunnah-e-Nabwi (Sallallaho
Alaihe Wasallam) and, for this purpose, shall
also consider the expositions and opinions of
recognized Fuqaha of Islam”.

The PLD 1989 Supreme Court (Shariat
Appellate Bench) page 633 is also supporting the
petitioner’s version regarding the application of Sharia

Law in such like cases.

7. The legal question raised by learned counsel

Tajamul

for the petitioner/convict needs thorough deliberation.
Moreover, the petitioner is a student of F.Sc who
attempted one paper from jail, therefore, keeping in view
provisions of Paragraph 9 of Shari Nizam-e-Adl
Regulation, 2009 as well as the judgment reported as
PLD 1989 Supreme Court (Shariat Appellate Bench)
page 633, this Cr.M is allowed. The petitioner/convict is
directed to be released on bail untill 17.9.2015 provided
he furnishes a bail bond for Rs.200,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court, who shall ensure that the sureties are
local, reliable and men means. Office is directed to fix
the main appeal on the date aforementioned and ensure
attendance of all concerned as the case will be positively
argued on that date.
