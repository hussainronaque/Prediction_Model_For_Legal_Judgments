1997, P.S CTD (Peshawar) against the accused.

3. Arrest of the Accused/appellant has been
procured on 12.04.2021.

4. On completion of the investigation, the matter
was sent up for trial and the prosecution, in order to
bring home charge against the accused/appellant, the
account of the prosecution is consisting of fourteen
PWs including complainant. The prosecution windup
its account and the learned trial Court confronted the
accused with the evidence so furnished against him
during the trial through a questionnaire & examined
ws 342 Cr.P.C. However, the accused neither wish to
be examined on oath u/s 340 Cr.P.C nor opted to
furnish defence, however, professed to be innocent.

5. In view of the assistance so rendered by the
learned prosecutor and learned defence counsel, the
learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion that the
prosecution has successfully bring home charge
against the accused, as such, the appellant/accused
was convicted & sentenced to: -

(a)u/s 387 PPC for 05 years RI with fine of Rs:

20,000/- or 20 days SI in default.

(e) U/s 25-D Telegraph Act, 1885 convicted &
sentenced to one (01) years with fine of Rs:5000/-
or 08 days SI in default of payment of fine.

() U/s 14. Foreign Act, 1946, the

appellant/accused was acquitted.

However, benefit of 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to the appellant with remarks that the subject

sentences shall run concurrently.

6. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
th True enough, the prosecution’s case

against the appellant/accused pertaining to demand of
Donation (Bhatta), criminal intimidation, cheating
etc, however, based/foundation of the prosecution

case is, are cell phones calls from cell phone # 0333-
9279797 to the complainant’s cell phone # 0311-
9404448.

8. The evidence so collected during the
investigation could not substantiate that sim registered
through its number 0333-9279797 is in the name of
the appellant/accused. Other than it, cogent and
reliable evidence is missing which could prima facie
speak loud & clear that the accused facing trial was
well connected through the subject cell number either
with his family members or his other nearer & dearer
so that it could prima facie be observed that the
appellant/accused being clever & crook enough not to
avail the subject cell number in his name rather
through a proxy. The Court is conscious enough that
the subject sim number may be registered in the name
of the appellant/accused but it shall not skip the
attention of the Court that record of call data so
furnished only speak of the cellular connectivity of
the appellant/accused and respondent/complainant but
it is hard fact that the demand/request in respect of the
proposed collection was for the welfare of the orphans
and widows. An iota of evidence has neither been
collected during the investigation nor furnished
during the trial which could prima facie speak of the

fact that in-fact the subject collection was Bhatta
amount or extortion but to avoid any penal
consequences it was posed as donation for the
orphans & widows.

9. Close perusal of the evidence so
furnished during the trial would transpire that Yar
Gul, PW-4 has very fairly conceded that no threat
calls through cellular phone has ever been received by
him. Likewise, he expressed his ignorance regarding
the name of the caller nor any sort of threat. It has
also been admitted that he has never furnished any
application to the local police in respect of the subject
threat calls and Bhatta. He denied the suggestion
regarding the complaint/Mad attributed to him to had
been written against accused Alamzeb. He has very
fairly conceded that no threat calls were given to him
by the caller/appellant-accused.

10. Similarly, the account of
complainant/star witness of the prosecution, Sher
Ahmad as PW-6 speak loud & clear that the
application and complaint was drafted by Muharrir of
the Police Post, Akhun Abad. He did disclose
regarding the receipt of the threatening call, however,
he very fairly conceded in his examination-in-cross
that he had never ever mentioned the name of the

appellant/accused either in the application nor in his
%S

examination-in-chief recorded during the trial. He
disclosed that on his visit to the police station to
approach the local police through an application for
redressal, a police official, namely Imtiaz who
checked through software his cell phone in respect of
the threatening calls and highlighted that the cell
number with respect to the threatening call is in the
name of Zahid r/o Akhun Abad No.4 Peshawar.

11. Deep analysis of the evidence so
furnished, particularly, account of Sher Ahmad as
PW-6 and Yar Gul PW-4, star. witnesses of the
prosecution would transpire that the subject witnesses
have never ever attributed the alleged threatening
calls to the accused Zahid and expressed their
ignorance regarding the alleged threat calls.

12. It is floating fact on surface of the record
that during the trial the star witnesses have repeatedly
disclosed the demand with respect to the event in
hand from the caller was with regard to donation for
the welfare of orphans and widows and nothing as
such has been highlighted which could give a slight
presumption of Bhatta amounts to extortion.

13. In the circumstances where the
complainant in his account has very fairly conceded

that he has not disclosed the name of Zahid, the
Me

accused facing trial during the investigation to the I.O
and his account not only falsify the allegations of
demand of Bhatta by the appellant-accused, whereas,
the subject demand has been conceded as donation for
the welfare of the suppressed class of the society, it
would be unfair to connect the accused Zahid with the
allegation of extortion/Bhatta.

14. An iota of evidence has not been led by
the prosecution to prove any link/nexus of the
appellant/accused with a commission of offence.

15. The evidence led by the prosecution is
suffering from material contradictions and
discrepancies which make the prosecution case highly
doubtful, and, benefit of the same should have been
extended to the appellant, but the learned trial Court
by not appreciating the evidence in its true
perspective, reached to a wrong conclusion by
holding the appellant guilty of the offence. It has been
held, umpteenth times by the superior courts, that a
slightest doubt occurs in the prosecution case is
sufficient to grant acquittal to an accused “Muhammad
Akram Vs. State (2009 SCMR 230) Khalid Mahmood vs.
State (2011 SCMR_664), Tahir Khan Vs. State (2011

SCMR 646), Nazim Khan Vs. State (1984 PLD SC 433),
Farman Ahmad Vs, Muhammad Inayat (2007 SCMR
1825). The conclusions drawn by the learned trial
Court are not borne out of the case evidence,
therefore, the impugned judgment is not sustainable in
the eye of law.

16. Accordingly, for the forgoing reasons,
the appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentences of the
appellant recorded by the learned trial Court through
impugned judgment is hereby set-aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges leveled against
him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to
be detained in any other case.
