ORDER

cr

Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J.- Brief facts of the case are that -

an FIR No. 127 dated 10.05.2002 was registered by one
Muhammad Ilyas (‘complainant’) ‘under sections 302, 109 and
Pakistan Penal Code, (PPC) at Police Station, City Samundri,
District Faisalabad against the appellant, co-accused Muhammad
Shafique and two unknown persons. It is alleged that the appellant
made firing upon Haji Muhammad Ishaq and Mushtaq Ahmad,
who fell down and thereafter, the other co-accused also made
indiscriminating firing as a result whereof, Haji Muhammad Ishaq
and Mushtaq Ahmad succumbed to their injuries. The appellant
absconded whereas, Muhammad Shafiq was arrested. He faced

trial and was acquitted of the charge by the Trial Court.

2. The appellant was subsequently arrested on 25 May 2006.
During the investigation, upon a disclosure of the appellant, a 12.
bore gun allegedly used in the commission of the offence was

recovered on his pointation. After completion of the investigation, a

fe

Cri.A No. .56 of 2019

report under section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC)
was submitted before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge,
Faisalabad (Trial Court). After conclusion of the trial, the appellant
was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and Was ‘wentenced to
death on two counts by the Trial Court, vide judgment dated
26.01.2008. An appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the
High Court, maintaining the judgment of the Trial Court and
answered the Murder Reference in affirmative through the
impugned judgment. Feeling aggrieved, a petition for leave to

appeal was filed, wherein leave was granted.

3. Arguments ‘heard and have perused the record. In order to
_ prove its case, out of the three eye-witnesses, the prosecution has
“produced Muhammad Ilyas, PW-10, Muhammad Amjad, PW-11.
According to the eparabincanin and as per the FIR, the appellant
made four successive fire shots upon the person of Mushtaq
Ahmad and five successive fire shots upon Muhammad Ishaq who
fell down, Seta the other three co-accused also made
indiscriminate firing upon the deceased. Therefore, it cannot be
said with certainty that out of all the four assailants, how many
shots were fired and whose fire shot had resulted into causing
death of the deceased. As far as the recovery of a crime weapon is
concerned, it is the case of the prosecution that the appellant fired
shots with rifle, however, there is a divergent version on the record
qua the recovery of gun 12 bore and a pistol instead of gun 12 bore
and that too had not been sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for
examination, hence the recovery of crime weapon is
inconsequential. Therefore, the High Court has rightly disbelieved

the recovery,
' te Pd s ; 3
Cri.A No. .56 of 2019 : :

4. Facts and circumstances of the case, lead us to a conclusion
that the occurrence had taken place all of a sudden without there
being any proof of premeditation. It was a free fight, without any
motive. On the basis of the available material, it is proved that all
the accused committed firing upon the deceased, but it is not
established that the appellant alone was responsible for the
commission of the murder or the injury esainlad due to his firing
was fatal. However, the prosecution has succeeded in proving its
case iit the appellant under section 302(b) read with section
34, PPC for the act done by him along with the co-accused. In view
of the facts and circumstances discussed herein above, there are
reasonable grounds for mitigation. Thus, awarding capital
: praniblancdt to the appellant in the given circumstances, is
“unjustified. The fora below were required to have had exercised
their discretion by awarding lesser punishment as provided by

section 302(2), PPC, but the needful was not done.

5. Even otherwise, the appellant was arrested in the month of
May 2006 and it took two years to oouniets his trial in the year
2008. The appeal filed before the High Court remained pending for
more than five years till its dismissal. The petition for leave to
appeal filed against the impugned judgment before this Court in
the year 2013 was fixed for hearing for the first time on 28
January 2019, and leave was granted. Lastly, the case was heard
finally on 24 March 2024. The appellant remained in custody w.e.f.
May 2006 till date, out of which, he was incarcerated in death cell
w.e.f, 2013, almost for more than eleven years, for no fault of his.
Section 302(b), PPC provides a punishment for death or
imprisonment for life as Taazir. If an accused is sentenced to
death, he is shifted to a death cell and while incarcerated, he is not

entitled for remissions. On the other hand, if an accused is

Cri,A No. 56 of 2019

sentenced to imprisonment for life, he is detained in normal jail
and is also entitled for remissions as per the law. The appellant
has served almost an imprisonment for life, including eleven years
detention in death cell. Under such circumstances, executing his
death sentence at this stage would be harsh, especially, when
there are mitigating circumstances as well. Reliance in this behalf
can be placed upon the judgment of this Court passed in the case

of Ghulam Shabbir!.

Thus, in view of the above, the appeal is dismissed. The
«conviction awarded to the appellant under section 302(b), PPC on
two counts is maintained, however, the sentence of death awarded

to the appellant is altered to that of imprisonment for life on two
“counts, All the sentences awarded to the appellant, that is, in FIR
No. 51 dated 02.03.2000 (Criminal Appeal No. 57/2019) and FIR
No. 127 dated 10.05.2022 (the subject appeal) shall run

concurrently with the benefit of section 382-B, Cr.PC.

JUDGMENT

Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J:- I have had the
privilege of going through the judgment (“majority judgment”)
authored by my learned Colleague Mr. Jamal Khan Mandokhail, J.
With great respect, I do not find myself in agreement to it for the
facts and reasons mentioned herein.
2. Facts in brief are that an FIR No. 127 dated
10.05.2002 under section 302 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code,

1860 (“PPC”) was registered by one Muhammad Ilyas

- (“Complainant”) at the Police Station, City Samundari, District

” Faisalabad against the appellant, co-accused Muhammad Shafique

and two unknown persons. The allegation against the appellant
wot the .co-accused persons is that on 10.05.2002, at
approximately 6:30 a.m., Haji Muhammad Ishaq.and his son,
Mushtaq Ahmed (both now deceased), were present at their shop
when the appellant, armed with a rifle, along with three co-accused
persons including Muhammad Shafiq and two unknown, each
carrying .30. bore pistols, raised a lalkara. The appellant then fired
four consecutive shots at Mushtaq Ahmed and five shots at
Muhammad Ishaq, causing both to fall. Subsequently, the co-
accused ierenes indiscriminately fired upon them leading to their
deaths. Following the incident, the appellant absconded from the
place of incident, while co-accused Muhammad Shafiq was
apprehended and faced trial but was acquitted of the charges.

3. The appellant was arrested on 25.05.2006 and after a
full-fledged trial he was convicted and sentencéd to death penalty
by the Trial Court. The death sentence was subsequently
confirmed by the High Court, and his appeal against the conviction

was dismissed.

Dissent in Cri.Appeal No.56/2019 : 2.

4. Although the majority judgment recognizes that the
prosecution effectively established its case against the appellant,
however, it has, in light of following consideration of mitigating
circumstances, altered the death sentence to life imprisonment.

i) That it remains uncertain how many shots were fired og
each of the four assailanta, and it is unclear whose shot
caused the deaths of the victims.

ii) That the incident occurred spontaneously, with no
evidence of premeditation, and it was deemed a free fight
without any discernible motive.

iii) That co-accused Muhammad Shafiq has been acquitted.

iv) That there were considerable delays in the conclusion of
trial and hearing of appeal consequently the appellant
remained in custody w.e.f. May 2006 till date.

I find myself unable to concur with any of these considerations.

5. Perusal of the record demonstrates ‘that in order to
prove the case, the prosecution produced sixteen witnesses during
the trial. Complainant Muhammad Ilyas (PW-10), Muhammad
Amjad (PW-11) and Aslam are the eye-witnesses. The occurrence in
this case took place in front of the shop owned by the Muhammad
Ishaq and Muhammad Mushtaq (deceased persons). All eye-
witnesses are residents of the same area, Furthermore,
Muhammad Ishaq, one of the deceased, was the maternal uncle of
both Muhammad Ilyas and Muhammad Amjad, making their
presence at the shop neither unnatural nor improbable. The
appellant is named in the FIR with specific role of causing
successive firearm injuries on the deceased persons. The relevant
part of the testimony of the complainant Muhammad Ilyas (PW-10)

is reproduced below for the ease of reference:-
Dissent in CrAppeal No,56/2019 3

“.. On 10.05.2006, at about 06:30 a.m, Mushtaq was
standing in the street, while Ishaq was in his shop. J,
Amjad and Aslam were standing in the outer door of Ahata
near the shop of Muhammad Ishaq and were talking with
each other. All of sudden, we hear lalkara and saw in the
street that Ghulam Rasool accused present in the Court,

armed

itted armed wit i u
persons duly armed with pistols z whom ts can an identify if
confronted. In our view, the accused Ghulam Rasool made
four fire shots with his rifle at Mushtag Ahmad, which hit

&
ebrow, forhead, neck

< layique and two NKNOWT Persons Started firing
which hit on different parts of bodies of Muhammad Ishaq
and Muhammad Mushtaq. ...”

This version was supported by the testimony of the second

; eye-witness, Muhammad Amjad (PW-11). Both witnesses provided

consistent ocular account on details of the case, such as the
incident's tation. the weapon used by the appellant, the timing,
and the sequence of events. Their testimonies were straightforward
and convincing. Even after undergoing extensive and rigorous
cross-examination, both witnesses remained steadfast and
demonstrated a high degree of reliability and consistency in their
testimony.

6. The ocular account furnished by the eye-witnesses
finds full. corroboration by the medical evidence provided by.Dr.
Muhammad Ayub (PW-12). Dr. Ayub conducted the post-mortem
examination on Muhammad Ishaq on 10.05.2002 and identified
the following injuries:

1-A. A firearm wound of entry 2 x 2 cm present on the
medial side of left eye brow, with burnt inverted margins
deep going to injury No.1-B which, was wound of exit 5x 3

5-A. A grazing firearm wound 4 cm x 1 cm with everted
margins on the outer lower right forearm.

Thus, specific injuries attributed to the appellant by the eye-

witnesses find corroboration from the post-mortem report. Based

on the post mortem report, Dr. Ayub rendered the opinion as

if

reproduced below:-

Opinion: After internal and external post mortem

. examination of the dead body, the cause of death in the

opinion of PW-12 was haemorrhage and shock as the result
of injuries No.1 to 5. In ordinary course of nature, the cause

of death. Injury Nos.1, 2 and 3 are individually fatal while -

injury No.4. and 5 were simple.

Moreover, following injuries were found on the

body of the Muhammad Mushtaq:-

dead

Based on the findings detailed in the post-mortem report, Dr. Ayub

provided the following opinion:

Dissent in Crl Appeal No.56/2019 -5-

“Opinion: After internal and external post mortem
examination of the dead body, the cause of death was
haemorrhage and shock as the result of injuries No.1 to 5
which were sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause
death. Injury Nos.2,3, and 5 are individually fatal while
injury No.1 & 4. were simple in nature All injuries were
ante-mortem and caused by firearm.” i

Thus, perusal of the evidence indicates that specific injuries
attributed to the appellant were sufficient in ordinary course of
nature to cause death.

8. The motive behind the occurrence, as per prosecution

case, was that Muhammad Ishaq deceased was the complainant in

I the case FIR No. 51/2000 registered under section 302/109/201

PPC at Police station Samundari City against the appellant. The

appellant threatened Muhammad Ishaq the deceased, not to
pursue the said case and due to this grudge the appellant
committed murder of Muhammad Ishaq and Mushtaq Ahmed. The
motive was proved by the witnesses as revealed by their
testimonies. For ready reference the relevant portions from the
cross examination of the Muhammad Ilyas (PW-10) is reproduced
below:-

«_.It is correct that Farman Ali deceased was murdered
by on the 2/3/2000 and case was registered against
Ghulam Rasool etc, in which Muhammad Ishag deceased
was the complainant... .

“,.. It is incorrect to suggest that no proceedings in the
case of Farman Ali deceased was in progress during the
days of occurrence of instant case. It is incorrect to
suggest that Muhammad Ishaq deceased was not gone
anywhere to follow the case of murder of Farman.”

9. Perusal of the evidence clearly demonstrates that the
motive is firmly established and was correctly upheld by the High
Court. Given the evidence and facts of the case, it is impossible, by

any stretch of the imagination, to consider the incident as a mere

spontancous fight or an act of unpremeditated murder.

Dissent in Crl.Appeal No.56/2019 -6-

10. As far as acquittal of the Muhammad Shafiq (co-
accused) is concerned, it is pertinent to highlight that his case is
quite distinguishable from the appellant. Muhammad Shafiq was
not implicated in causing any specific injuries to Muhammad Ishaq
or Mushtaq Ahmed, whereas the appellant was directly attributed
with the role of inflicting firearm injuries. The role assigned to
Muhammad Shafiq was not substantiated by the medical evidence,
in contrast to the appellant’s role, which is fully supported by such
evidence. Additionally, no motive was established against

- Muhammad Shafiq, whereas a specific motive was clearly identified

* in relation to the appellant. Consequently, as Muhammad Shafiq’s

case is fundamentally distinct from that of the appellant, his
acquittal holds no bearing on the appellant’s case.
11. As far recovery of weapon of crime is concerned, it was
rightly disbelieved by the lower fora. It has been rightly held by the
High Court that even if recovery is excluded there is sufficient
incriminating material against the appellant in the form of
testimony of eye-witnesses corroborated by the medical evidence
and motive. Reference in this regard may be made to the case of
Mukhtar Ahmed v. The State (2004 SCMR 220) wherein it has
been observed that:-

“2, We have gone through the evidence of these two
witnesses and find that the same, inspires confidence and
_ presence of these two witnesses at the spot at the relevant
time is also proved beyond any doubt. The only defence
plea raised in the crossexamination of P. W.6 by the
petitioner was that on the day of occurrence, there was
cross -firing between Nathoo party and Haji Sultan
Mughal party and that the deceased was hit by bullet on
account of this cross-firing. No suggestion was made that
the cross-firing took place at 6-00 a.m, when the incident
took place.
3. When questioned, learned counsel frankly admitted
that no report or F.I.R. was lodged for the said cross-firing
on the said date in the village by anyone. He however,
submitted that no recovery of .7 mm rifle was made which
was allegedly used by the petitioner. He also admitted that
no empty from the spot was also recovered, therefore, in
our view, non-recovery of weapon of offence in the
t

Dissent in Crl.Appeal No.56/2019 -T-

se,

circumstances of the case was not fatal to the prosecution
case. The ocular account given by the witnesses was such

‘ which could be sufficient to bring home guilt to the

petitioner.” :
12. In the case of Miss Najiba and another vs. Ahmed

Sultan Alias Sattar and 2 others (2001 SCMR 988) it has been

noted that:-

“6, It is obvious from the above-cited case-law that it has
been consistently held that when prosecution proves its
case beyond any doubt then it is the legal duty of the
Court to impose deterrent punishment on the offenders to
make the evil doers an example and a warning to the
likeminded people. 'Despite the fact that the crime is
increasing in the society yet the Courts normally avoid to
award normal penalty of death in offences punishable with
- death which amounts to gross miscarriage of justice
whereas the Courts are duty-bound to do complete justice
with both the parties. It has been observed with great
concern that whenever people fail to get due justice from
the Court of law, they resort to take the law in their own
hands to settle their matters themselves. Such a situation
is very alarming and it is the need of the hour that the
Courts should hold the scale of justice even in.
dispensation of justice to the parties. In offences
punishable with death, the normal penalty prescribed by
law is death sentence, however, in cases where there are
mitigating or extenuating circumstances warranting lesser
punishment, the Courts while awarding lesser
punishment have to record reasons justifying the same.”

As demonstrated by the prosecution's evidence, the appellant
committed murder in a particularly brutal and sacauttioas manner,
killing two individuals who were actively pursuing a case against
the etipeiian® for a previous murder of Farman Ali deceased. Given
the gravity of the offence and the appellant's conduct, he is not
entitled to any leniency in sentencing.

13. An important question that needs deteteinaticn is
that whether a delay in trial or deciding the appeal in the cases of
death sentence constitutes a mitigating circumstance to award a
lesser punishment. A similar question came up before the Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of Muhammad Hassan vs. The State

(1973 SCMR 344) wherein it has been observed that:- ‘

“Sh. Shaukat Ali, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of
. the petitioner has not disputed before us the conviction of
the petitioner for the murder of the two girls. He has,
Dissent in Crl.Appeal No.56/2019 -8-

however, contended that in the facts and circumstances of
the case the petitioner should not have been awarded the
extreme penalty of law, namely, death. He has contended
in the first instance, that having regard to the fact that a
long time had elapsed between the occurrence and the
sentence of death passed upon the petitioner, the High
Court should not have confirmed the death sentence. He
has submitted that the occurrence took place on the 3rd
of November 1969, and the petitioner was convicted and
sentenced to death on the 19th of May 1971, by the trial
Court and his death sentence was confirmed by the High
Court on the 30th of September 1972. In support of this
contention he has drawn our attention to Chapter 24-B,
Rule 6 of the Rules and Orders of the High Court of
Judicature at Lahore, Vol. III, which says that the High
_ Court requires explanations to be furnished in monthly
Sessions Statements of any cases pending over two
months... .
We do not find any substance in this contention. The afore’

Moreover in the case of Samano v. The State (1973 SCMR 162) it

was ruled that:-

“I am, therefore, of the view that both the appellants have
been rightly convicted and no distinction can be made
between the two. As regards the sentence, it is true that
the incident took place as long ago as November 1954, but
the mere length of time taken in concluding the trial and
in deciding the appeals filed by the appellants would not
by itself constitute an extenuating circumstance justifying
the imposition of the lesser penalty. The appellants acted
in a cruel and cold-blooded manner by allowing
themselves to be hired as assassins. They do not deserve
any leniency in the matter of punishment. I would,
therefore, maintain their sentences and dismiss both the
appeals.”

Similar view was also taken in the case of Shah Muhammad v. The State

(PLD 1973 SC 332) as reproduced below:-

In this view of the matter, we have, after giving our
anxious consideration to all the facts and circumstances
of the case and the able arguments advanced on behalf of
the appellant, come to the conclusion that this appeal
must fail and accordingly dismiss it. The convictions and
sentences of the appellant are upheld. The fact that more
than 4 1/2 years have elapsed since his conviction is not a
circumstance, which we can take into consideration. If the
delay in the execution of the sentence can by itself be a
sufficient ground for commutation then the appellant can
approach the Executive authorities for such commutation;
but, so far as this Court is concerned, it cannot, in the
Dissent in CrLAppeal No.56/2019 -9-

facts and circumstances of this case, recommend any
such action.

In the case of Bakshish Elahi v. The State (1977 SCMR 389) it was
noted that:-

“The Legislature has conferred very wide discretion on the
Courts in the matter of sentences under the Penal Code,
but as the discretion has to be exercised judicially, the
Courts would be entitled to take into account the law and
order situation, if the object of punishment or one of the
objects of punishment be to deter the commission of
further crimes. Now, I do not see how there can be any.
doubt about this question. Salmond observes in his book
on Jurisprudence (Tenth Edition) at page 111
"Punishment is before all things deterrent, and the chief
end of the law of crime is to make the evil doer an example

. and a warning to all that are likeminded with him" would
agree with this passage, and the learned Single Judge
yeas justified in holding that a severer sentence was
“necessary on account of the increase of crime, provided of
course culpable homicides of the type under consideration
have increased, as held by the learned Single Judge.”

14. In the present case, the prosecution clearly
i demonstrated that the appellant, along with others, was involved
in a deliberate and premeditated murder. Because of the brutality
and dangerousness of the act committed intentionally by the
appellant, it is necessary to impose the strict punishment i.e.
capital punishment, in order to deliver justice and protect society.
1a: Mitigating the punishment based on the long trial or
the time the appellant spent in custody does not change the
severity of the crime. While it is unfortunate that the appellant is
in custody for a long time due to delays in the trial and appeals,
however it does not justify leniency. The length of time in custody
is a result of the legal process and cannot be considered by any
cannons of interpretation to be an indication that the crime
committed by the appellant is not serious. oe perusal of the clear
evidence of the appellant's involvement in a brutal murder, the

death penalty remains the appropriate and necessary punishment.

The appellant is a habitual criminal of committing the murder of

the innocent persons. Therefore, reducing the sentence would
Dissent in Cri. Appeat No.56/2019 +10-

undermine the justice deserved by the victims and the severity of

the crime committed.

16. In light of the above discussion, I find that both the

Trial court and the High Court have thoroughly examined all

aspects of the case, appreciated the evidence, and have rightly

imposed the death penalty as a just and appropriate sentence.
fi - Consequently, this appeal is dismissed and death

penalty imposed by the learned High Court is maintained.
