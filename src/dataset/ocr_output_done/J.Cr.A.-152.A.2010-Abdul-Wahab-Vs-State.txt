QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J-. This single
judgment shall also dispose of Criminal Revision
No.50-A/2010, moved by complainant, Mian Khan,
for enhancement of punishment awarded to
convict/appellant by the learned Sessions Judge,
Battagram, in case FIR No.22 dated 05.03.2009
under Sections 302/324/34 PPC Police Station
Shamlai, Battagram, vide the impugned judgment
dated 23.08.2010.

2. The FIR in the case would show that
Muhammad Amjad SHO of the Police Station
received information about an injured person
brought to CH Hospital Battagram when he was
present alongwith a police contingent in Battagram
in connection with a meeting whereupon he rushed

to the emergency ward of CH
Battarrtgram, where complainant, Mian Khan,
lodged report at 14:10 hours that in the morning at
08:00 hours he alongwith his brother Umar, and
Ishaq son of Toor were proceeding towards Jungle
from their residence for grazing goats and _ the
moment they came out of the house, they found the
accused/appellant, Abdul Wahab, and co-accused,
Muhammad Hilal, present there with Pistol and
Kalashnikov and started altercation over cutting of
tree, and also started firing at them, and with firing
of Kalashnikov by the accused/appellant his brother
Umar was hit on his head and died instantaneously,
while he was hit with the firing of co-accused
Muhammad Hilal who was armed with Pistol and
sustained firearm injuries on different parts of his
body, whereas Ishaq escaped unhurt. The
complainant specifically named Ishaq as the eye-
witness alongwith other persons while charging both
the accused named above for the Qat/-i- Amd of his
brother and attempt at his life by causing him
firearm injuries.

3. After drafting murasila on his report, the
SHO arrested the injured complainant as he was
proclaimed offender in case No.23/01 under

sections 302/34 PPC PS Shamlai. Meanwhile, dead
body of deceased Umar was brought to the hospital,
and was referred to the Medical Officer for Post
Mortem Examination. On receipt of murasila in the
Police Station, the case was registered, and
investigation in the case was assigned to the
investigation branch of the local police.

4. During investigation, the 1.0. visited the
spot, conducted spot inspection, during which, he
secured blood stained earth from the places
assigned to the deceased and injured complainant
in the site plan and also recovered two crimes
empties each of 7.62 bore and 30 bore,
respectively, from the places assigned to both the
accused in the site plan prepared by the IO on the
pointation of the eye-witnesses. The 1.0. raided
house of Raghbat Mian on prior information of
presence of the accused/appellant in his house and
arrested the accused/appellant and recovered the
Kalashnikov from his possession, and both the
Kalashnikovs and crime empties of 7.62 bore
recovered during spot inspection were dispatched to
the firearms expert, wherefrom the report
was received in the _ affirmative. Likewise,
the blood stained earth collected from the

places of deceased and injured
complainant alongwith their blood stained garments
were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory
(FSL), and the report received therefrom was also in
the affirmative. The accused/appellant also reported
to Muhammad Riaz Khan Inspector Investigation
Battagram in village Nairay at the time of his arrest
at 17:30 hours on the eventful day that he had gone
to the Jungle for fetching wooden logs and when he
was lifting the log, the complainant and his brother
came there and altercation ensued on _ the
ownership of log, resulting in axe blow on his head
by brother of the complainant (not named in the
report), while during scuffle, he snatched
Kalashinkov from complainant and in the meantime
firing also took place, and he managed to flee and
take refuge in the house of Raghbat Mian and
Aimal Mian; and handed over the Kalashinkov
alongwith 15 rounds to the police and also
surrendered himself to the police for his arrest.
While also complaining injury on his left hand
beside the stated injury on his head, the
accused/appellant cited dispute over Jungle as
motive for the offence, and cited co-accused
Muhammad Hilal as the eye-witness. The report of

the accused/appellant was recorded in the Daily
Diary of the Police Station at Serial.No.13 dated
05.03.2009. On the receipt of medical report, the
report initially recorded in the Daily Diary of the
Police Station was incorporated in FIR No. 25 dated
09.03.2009 under sections 337-A iii/F iii/34 PPC at
Police Station, Shamlai, Battagram.

5. The deceased, Umar, was examined by
the medical officer, who furnished the following post

bones on left temporal bone 10 cm deep 8 % cm lat to
middle line vertex exit wound.

2. | cm circular and 10 cm deep inverted margins

lobe “Entry wound”.

3. Bruises around both eyes left and right side.
4. Fresh bleeding from both ears.”
6. Similarly, the same medical officer

as follows;

4. Circular 1 cm circumference and 4 to 5 cm
deep wound. 8 to 9 cm above right iliac crest. Entry
wound fresh bleeding.

2. Circular averted margin around 2 % cm round

renal area. 8 to 9 cm deep exit wound, fresh bleeding.
3. Left elbow wound 2 cm diameter dorsal aspect
with crepitus.

4. Left blue eye with sub _ conjunctival
hemorrhage.”

7. The co-accused, Muhammad Hilal,
could not be arrested and was therefore proceeded
against under sections 204 & 87 Cr.P.C and challan

was submitted against him under section 512 Cr.PC
when challan was submitted against the
accused/appellant after completion of investigation.
8. The trial Court framed charge under
section 302/324/34 PPC against the
accused/appellant to which he pleaded not guilty
and claimed trial. During trial, the prosecution
produced 08 PWs. PW-1, Abdul Wahid, Muharrir
Police Station Shamlai registered case/FIR on the
receipt of murasila; PW-2, Muhammad Amjad, ASI
drafted murasila on the report of the complainant
and also prepared his injury sheet as well as injury
sheet and inquest report of the deceased and
referred both of them for medical and PM
examination, respectively, and also submitted
complete challan in the case after completion of
investigation; PW-3, Mian Khan, is the complainant
and lodger of FIR and furnished ocular account of
the occurrence; PW-4, Mst: Saira, appeared as an
eye-witness; PW-5, Dr. Lal Kumar, is the medical
officer who conducted medical examination of the
injured complainant as well as post mortem
examination of deceased Umar; PW-6, Zahoor
Ahmad, IHC is marginal witness to several recovery
memos prepared by the I|.0. during investigation;

PW-7, Muhammad Riaz Khan, Inspector conducted
investigation in the case and PW-8, Muhammad
Babar, was entrusted with warrant under Section
204 Cr.PC as well as proclamation against
absconding accused Muhammad Hilal. The
prosecution abandoned PW Ishaq “being won over’,
and also abandoned rest of the PWs being
unnecessary, and closed its evidence; whereafter,
statement of the accused/appellant was recorded
under section 342 Cr.PC, wherein he refuted
allegations of the prosecution but declined to be
either examined on oath on the ground that he was
already examined on oath in the cross case, or
produce defence on the ground that he had already
exhibited defence.

9. On conclusion of the trial, the
accused/appellant was convicted under section
302-B PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life
as Tazeer. The accused/appellant was, however,
acquitted of the charge under section 324 PPC; and
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was also extended
to him, vide the impugned judgment of the learned
trial Court) Sessions Judge, Battagram, dated
23.08.2010; whereby, the co-accused Muhammad

Hilal was declared a proclaimed offender.
10. Arguments of the learned counsel for
the accused/appellant, learned Addl: AG assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant heard, and
record perused.

11. The learned counsel for the
accused/appellant argued that there was a cross
version to the version of complainant given in the
FIR and that the accused/appellant had also
sustained serious injuries on his head caused by
sharp and blunt means and was therefore not in a
position to cause firearm injuries to the complainant,
who was a proclaimed offender and was having the
weapons of offence i.e. Kalashinkov with him, which
was snatched from him by the accused/appellant
during scuffle and handed over to the police at the
time of his arrest. The learned counsel further
argued that the only eye-witness named in the FIR,
Ishaq, was abandoned by the prosecution, and,
instead, wife of Mian Khan complainant, namely
Mst. Saira, was produced as an eye-witness, who
was not mentioned as an eye-witness in the FIR.
According to the learned counsel, there was no
trustworthy ocular or circumstantial evidence to

bring home charge against the accused/appellant.
12. The learned Addl: AG assisted by the
learned counsel for the complainant, on the other
hand, not only defended conviction of the
accused/appellant but also prayed for awarding the
normal penalty of death to the accused/appellant for
the Qatl-i-Amd, and also his conviction and
awarding him sentence under section 324 PPC, as,
according to them, the accused was not only
charged by name in the promptly lodged FIR, but he
was also assigned the specific role of Qatl-i- Amd of
deceased Umar by firing at him with Kalashnikov
which was later on recovered from his possession
at the time of his arrest. They contended that not
only a positive report was received from the FSL in
respect of blood stained earth collected by the I.O.
from the spot and blood stained garments of the
deceased and injured complainant but the firearms
expert also furnished an affirmative report with
regard to the weapon of offence and crime empties
recovered from the place assigned to the
accused/appellant in the site plan prepared after
spot inspection by the |.0. They maintained that
there was no doubt about the presence of the
accused/appellant on the spot at the time of

occurrence as he received injury and himself lodged
a report thereby admitting his presence on the spot
at the time of occurrence.

13. The following striking features of the
case need to be taken into consideration for just
adjudication of the appeal by the accused/appellant
and criminal revision by the complainant:

a) The occurrence took place in the Jungle at
08:00 AM while report was lodged by the
complainant after more than O06 hours at 14:10
hours in CH Battagram to Muhammad Amjad SHO
when he arrived in the hospital on receiving
information about arrival of an injured person in the
hospital. The SHO drafted murasila on the report of
the complainant, and FIR was registered in the
Police Station after 03 hours and 20 minutes at
17:30 hours; but according to the PM report, the
dead body was brought by constable Gul Rehman
No.237 from Police Station Shamlai at 03:00 PM
and PM examination conducted at 04:00 PM. The
lodging of report with considerable delay, that too in
the hospital on arrival of the police, instead of Police
Station Shamlai where the dead body was taken in
the first instance and then brought therefrom to C.H.
Battagram, thus creating serious questions about

credibility of the FIR.
b) The complainant was admittedly a proclaimed
offender in case No.23/01 under section 302/34
Police Station Shamlai at the time of lodging report
to the police, and was arrested by the SHO after
recording his report; but it remained a mystery as to
how the SHO remembered even the case number
while sitting away from the Police Station in the
hospital.

c) It is not unusual that a proclaimed offender
would carry some kind of weapon with him; but it is
unlikely that the accused/appellant would carry
Kalashnikov while present on the spot for lifting
wooden logs. Therefore, the version’ of
accused/appellant would ring true to the extent that
the Kalashnikov was snatched by him from the
complainant during scuffle, and was_ voluntarily
handed over by him to the 1.0. at the time of his
arrest.

d) ‘The Kalashnikov was, allegedly, recovered by
the 1.0. when he conducted raid on the house of
Raghbat Mian son of Aimal Mian, on_ prior
information, for arrest of the accused/appellant; but

neither the said Raghbat Mian has been produced
as a PW, nor the persons shown present in the said
house at the time of arrest of the accused and
recovery of Kalashinkov from him have been
examined as witnesses of the prosecution in
support of the recovery of weapons of offence, thus
making both recovery of the so called weapon of
offence and report of firearms expert doubtful.
Above all, the accused/appellant has also been
acquitted of the charge against him in regard to
recovery of the Kalashinkov under section 13-AO
vide a separate judgment of today.

e) There is, admittedly, a cross version furnished
by the accused/appellant vide FIR No.25 dated
05.03.2009 under section 337-A iii/ F iii/34 PPC
Police Station, Shamlai, showing injuries caused to
him, mainly, on his head by axe blows by the
unnamed brother of the complainant, which have
been confirmed during medical examination by the
medical officer. This question remained unanswered
as to how brother of the complainant could come
closer to him when he was armed with Kalashinkov.
f) The only eye-witness mentioned in the FIR,
namely, Ishaq was abandoned by the prosecution.
The said Ishag had not only made pointation of the

spot to the 1.0. but had also recorded statement
13

under section 164 Cr.P.C during investigation,
whereby he supported version of the
accused/appellant and negated the version given by
the complainant in the FIR, despite being brother in
law and cousin of the complainant. The other eye-
witnesses, though not named in the FIR, yet
mentioned in the site plan, namely, Maah Gul and
Haroon were also abandoned, and only wife of the
complainant, Mst. Saira, was produced as an eye-
witness, who, besides being an interested witness,
was not mentioned as an eye-witness in the FIR,
and created serious doubts about the scene of
occurrence when stated in her statement before the
Court that the occurrence took place in their fields
and further that the empties and blood were not
recovered from banchar forest i.e. the scene of
occurrence, but were recovered from a field. She
made fatal improvements in her statement in order
to make out a case against the accused/appellant
on the one hand, and bring her statement in
conformity with the case of the prosecution on the
other.

13. The above narrated facts would show
serious discrepancies in the prosecution case,

thereby demolishing the edifice of the prosecution
case, which is replete with doubts. It is cardinal
principal of criminal law that the prosecution must
prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt, as
benefit of even a single doubt must go to the
accused. The prosecution has not been able to
establish its case and bring home charge against
the accused/appellant.

14. Consequently, the instant appeal is
allowed. Impugned conviction and sentences of
appellant, namely, Abdul Wahab son of Atiqullah
recorded under section 302 PPC by the learned
Sessions Judge, Battagram, vide judgment dated
23.08.2010 are set aside, and he be set free
forthwith if not required in any other case.
Resultantly, Cr.R. No.50-A/2010 is also dismissed.

Announced.
