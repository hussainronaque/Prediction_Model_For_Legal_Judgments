3. After completion of investigation, challan was
drawn and sent up for trial to the Court of competent

jurisdiction.

4, To bring home charge against the appellant/
accused, the prosecution placed reliance on the testimonies of
11 witnesses, followed by to confront the accused with the
evidence so furnished as his statement within the meaning of
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, the accused denied the

allegations of the prosecution and professed innocence.

5. On conclusion of the trial followed by arguments
of the learned prosecutor & learned defence counsel, the
learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion that the
prosecution has successfully brought home charge against the
accused, as such, the accused was convicted and sentenced to
death vide judgment, dated 06.12.2022, Sessions case No.36 of
2020, hence the subject criminal appeal alongwith Murder

Reference.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the
impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court is against the
law, facts and evidence available on record. The complainant
could not establish his presence on the scene of occurrence at
the fateful time coupled with the cause and purpose to

accompany the deceased by then; considerable delay with
-4-
regard to the registration of the event left behind due scope of
consultation and deliberation to falsely implicate an innocent
person. Concluded the mode & manner of the event so alleged
by the prosecution is not only unbelievable but has not been
substantiated through direct, cogent & worth reliable evidence

during the trial.

7, Conversely, learned A.A.G assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant argued that appellant is directly
charged for effective firing at the deceased and injured Ajmal
Khan; that ocular account furnished by the PWs is
straightforward and confidence inspiring which is
corroborated by the circumstantial & medical evidence, site
plan, recoveries of blood and crime empties from the spot; that
the FSL report also corroborates the prosecution case by
elaborating that the firing has been made from one and the
same weapon of offence (pistol .30 bore); that the prosecution
has successfully proved the guilt of the appellant through
overwhelming evidence available on record and sought

dismissal of appeal of the appellant.
8. Arguments heard and record perused.

9. Undeniably, the deceased is the sister in law of
the convict/appellant and husband of the deceased being real

brother of the convict/appellant, therefore, as per record made
-5-
available Ex.PW10/1 their respective residential units are
adjacent, however, separated by a boundary wall. Because of
the blood relation of the accused and husband of the deceased,
as per custom, culture & tradition of the locality, frequent
visits without formal permission is common phenomenon in

this part of country.

10. The story of the prosecution is that on the fateful
date, day & time, the convict/appellant armed with pistol
entered and fired at Mst. Robina Bibi, as a result of it, she was
hit and succumbed to her injuries. The learned trial Court has
placed reliance on the account of Laiq Zaman & Ajmal Khan,
PW-7 and PW-8, their account is direct, consistent and
unequivocal in terms that the convict/appellant the moment
came there, started firing at the deceased, as a result of it, she
was hit and fell down on the ground and the accused fled
away. Needless to highlight, PW Ajmal Khan also received
fire arm injuries. Because of the blood relation of the accused,
the question of false implication can safely be excluded,
whereas, the account of PW-7 Laiq Zaman is also direct,
consistent & unequivocal on the material points coupled with
the fact that his presence on the scene of occurrence at the
fateful time is also natural for the reason to pay a visit to the
house of his daughter and it is common culture & tradition of

the society in this part of country to pay a visit to the nearer &
-6-

dearer as a token of love and affection on the day of
celebration of social & religious occasions i.e. marriage, Eid
etc. However, account of the PW-7 is also silent regarding the

motive of occurrence.

11. It is transparent from the record that motive of the
occurrence does not figure at all either while lodging the
report at the initial stage followed by the exercise of
investigation and even during the trial none of the
prosecution's witnesses could be able to utter a single word in
this regard. In the prevailing circumstances where the
prosecution has neither alleged motive of the occurrence at the
first instance nor it has been even highlighted during the trial,
therefore, the peculiar facts & circumstances has driven the
Court to the conclusion that during the investigation followed
by during the trial nothing as such been surfaced which could

be treated as a motive for the subject event.

12. On this score alone, while lodging the report, the
complainant could not highlight motive for the occurrence and
on his turn in the witness box nothing as such has been
brought on record. Likewise, father of the deceased did furnish
his account during the trial but he could also not be able to
utter even a single word in respect of the motive of the fateful
incident at the earlier stage. The law of the land in this regard

is much settled by now that absence of motive or absence of
-7-

proof of the same would be a sufficient mitigating
circumstance to determine the quantum of sentence. The
Court can lay hands on some of the latest judgments of this
court for a matter of reference i.e. Mst. Nazia Anwar vy.
The State (2018 SCMR 911), Nadeem Ramzan v. The
State (2018 SCMR 149), Haq Nawaz v. The State (2018
SCMR 21), Ghulam Muhammad v. State (2017 SCMR
2048), Saif Ullah v. State (2017 SCMR 2041), Waris Ali

v. The State (2017 SCMR 1572).

13. In view of the evidence so furnished and made
as part of the record coupled with the assistance so provided
at the bar, the Court is of the considered view that the
prosecution has neither disclosed motive of the event at the
first instance nor has even highlighted the same during the
trial, benefit of which for the purpose of quantum of
sentence in this case will have to go to the appellant and the
appellant in the given circumstances, major penalty as death

shall be unwise.

14. In the circumstances where presence of the star
witnesses, husband of the deceased and father of the deceased
on the fateful time on the scene of occurrence could no way be
denied and their account regarding the involvement of the
convict/appellant in the commission of offence could also not

be under estimated for the simple reason that false implication
-8-
of the convict/appellant cannot even be imagine because
nothing as such is part of the investigation followed by the
record made available which could amount to clash of interest

of the PWs and accused.

15. To conclude, all such circumstances are taken as
sufficient justification for reduction of the sentence from
normal penalty of death to life imprisonment. Resultantly,
the instant appeal is partially allowed, conviction of the
convict/appellant is maintained, however, the quantum of
sentence as death awarded to the appellant under section
302(b), P.P.C. is reduced to life imprisonment. Benefit of
section 382-B, Cr.P.C. is extended to the appellant as well.
Rest of the sentences awarded by learned trial Court through
the impugned judgment shall remain intact. Murder

Reference No. 05-B of 2022 is answered in “negative”.
