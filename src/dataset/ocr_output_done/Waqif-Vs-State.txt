JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.- Petitioner

Wadif, seeks bail in case FIR No.1014 dated 21.09.2015,
registered under sections 399/400/401 PPC and S.15 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, in Police Station Yakatoot,
Peshawar.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are that he
being a member of gang of dacoits and thieves, on
21.09.2015 at 12.00 hours, alongwith co-accused was
present in the graveyard of Rehman Baba for the purpose of
dacoity, thus was nabbed by the local police and from his
possession a 30 bore pistol alongwith 5 live rounds was
recovered from his possession.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. In absence of any previous history of the
petitioner qua his involvement in the cases of dacoity and

theft as well as qua the factum of his preparation for the

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

purpose of dacoity at the time of his arrest, application of
sections 399, 400 and 401 PPC, requires further probe. So
far as recovery of 30 bore pistol from possession of the
petitioner is concerned, punishment of S.15 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, does not fall within the
Prohibitory Clause of $.497 Cr.P.C. and in such like cases
bail is a rule and refusal thereof an exception. There exists
no exceptional circumstance to clog the way of bail to the
petitioner.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes
bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local,
reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned Illagqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD,
concerned.
