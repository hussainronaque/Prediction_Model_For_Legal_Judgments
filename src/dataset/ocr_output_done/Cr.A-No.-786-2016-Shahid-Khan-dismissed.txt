JUDGMENT

KEKE

AHMAD ALL J. Through appeal in hand,
the appellant (Shahid Khan) has impugned
the judgment dated 22.11.2016, whereby he
was convicted and _ sentenced to life
imprisonment with fine of Rs.200,000/- or in
default of payment of fine to undergo 06
months S.I. with benefit u/s 382-B, by the
Court of learned Judge, Special Court (CNS),
Peshawar, in case FIR No.30 dated
21.04.2012, u/s 9(c)-13 CNSA 1997, Police

Station, ANF (Peshawar).

2. Brief facts of the case are that
complainant/Mumtaz Hussain, Sub-

Inspector/PW4 along with other officials of
ANF, pursuant to information from their
high-ups regarding smuggling, was present
on the spot. In the meantime, a Suzuki Pick-
Up was seen coming from Karkhano Market,
which was stopped. On query, the driver
disclosed his name as Shahid Khan. On
preliminary inquiry, the accused-
appellant/driver disclosed about the narcotics
concealed in the right door and the backside
of the seat. On his pointation, search of
vehicle led to recovery of 24 packets of
charas from its left side door and 7 packets
from the back of the seat. On weighment the
total contraband turned out to be 20.100 kgs.
31 samples of 10/10 grams sample from each
packet were separated for the purpose of
chemical analysis of FSL and sealed into
parcels No. 1 to 31 whereas the remaining
quantity was also sealed into a separate
plastic bag. Accused-appellant was arrested.
The Contraband and vehicle were taken into
possession vide recovery memo. On the basis
of murasila, FIR ibid was registered against
the accused-appellant.

2. On completion of investigation,

challan was submitted in Court where the
appellant was charge-sheeted to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

3. The prosecution in order to prove its
case, produced and examined as many as five
witnesses whereafter statement of the
accused was recorded, wherein, he professed
his innocence. The learned Trial Court, after
conclusion of trial, found the appellant guilty
of the charge and, while recording his
conviction, sentenced him as mentioned
above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has

filed the instant appeal before this Court.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of record shows that the

prosecution’s case against the appellant
hinges on evidence furnished by five
witnesses. Complainant of the case, namely,
Mumtaz Hussain Sub-Inspector appeared
before the court as PW-4, who deposed that
on 21.04.2012, there was information to the
high ups that narcotics smuggler Shahid
Khan will transport narcotics through Suzuki
pick up No. B-8018-Mardan from tribal
territory via Jamrod Road to Punjab, so he
alongwith other ANF personnel was present

on the spot/Nakabandi where he signaled the
vehicle in question driven by the appellant to
stop, which was searched and 24+7 packets
of charas, concealed in its left door and in
the back of the seat, were recovered, which
on weighment, turned out to be 20.800 kgs in
total. He separated 10/10 grams chars from
each packet and packed the remaining stuff
in a separate plastic bag. He prepared
recovery memo Ex.PW4/1 in presence of
marginal witnesses and also drafted murasila
Ex.PW4/2. The application for sending
samples to FSL is Ex.PW4/4. Accused and
contraband were then taken to police station
by him and handed over to Moharrir of the
police Station for safe custody. Moharrir sent
the samples to FSL through constable Tariq
who handed over the same in FSL and his
statement to this effect was also recorded by
him. The report of FSL Ex.PW4/10 is in

positive.

6. The recovery process was witnessed
by PW-5. This witness has deposed that in
his presence, the complainant had recovered
24 packets chars concealed in left door of the
vehicle and 7 packets hidden in the back of

the seat. He further deposed that the
complainant had separated 10/10 grams
chars from each packet in parcels No.1 to 31
for the purpose of FSL and sealed the
remaining stuff in a plastic bag duly

monogrammed by the complainant.

7. PW-3 is Tariq Afridi FC P.S. ANF,
Peshawar, who deposed in his statement
before the learned Trial Court that, after
handing over samples to him by the Moharrir
of the police station concerned, he took the
same to FSL in sealed parcels No.1 to 31
alongwith application of the I.0., English
docket and rout permit and obtained an
acknowledgement receipt from the concerned

official of FSL.

8. Moharrir of the police station, namely,
Shafiq Hussain, ASI, PS, ANF, Peshawar,
was examined being PW-1, who affirmed the
stances of Seizing Officer/PW4, witness to
the recovery memo PW-5 and PW-3 to
whom he handed over the sealed parcels
No.1 to 31 for taking to FSL. This witness
also confirmed the safe custody of
contraband being dumped in the warehouse/
malkhana of PS concerned. In the situation,

the very chain, from recovery to safe custody
and transmission of samples to FSL, has
obviously been established by _ the

prosecution without any shadow of doubt.

9. All the prosecution witnesses are
consistent and coherent in their statements
qua stopping the car, search of the vehicle,
recovery of case contraband there-from, its
weighment and separation of samples from
the recovered stuff, its transmission to the
FSL for chemical analysis and safe custody
of the remaining contraband in the Malkhana.
The defence did not succeed in bringing
anything from the witnesses’ mouth, which
could shatter their evidence. They were
unanimous in all major aspects of the case
and there is nothing on record, which could
cast any doubt on the prosecution case.

10. By producing worth reliable and
confidence inspiring evidence, the
prosecution has successfully discharged the
burden, which lay on its shoulder, whereafter
it was for the appellant to disproof the
prosecution’s case set up against him as per
Section 29 of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997. He could not produce

any reliable defence to show that either he
was not driving the vehicle at the relevant
time when same was stopped and he was
arrested or that the case contraband was
foisted upon him by the complainant. Though
he did examine two DWs but testimony of
these witnesses is not sufficient to dislodge
the prosecution case against him.

11. Learned counsel for the appellant also
contended with vehemence that the samples
were sent to FSL with a considerable delay
of 2 days, therefore, the prosecution case
against the appellant has lost its legal worth
as the very chain in it is missing.

12. We are not in agreement with the
learned counsel for the appellant on his ibid
proposition. Though there is a minor delay of
two days in sending the samples to FSL, but
the rules to that effect are directory and not
mandatory. There is nothing on record to
establish that the said parcels were ever
tampered with rather the evidence led by the
prosecution established that the parcels
received by the said laboratory, remained
intact. The arguments regarding applicability
of section 103, Cr.P.C. has no force as

section 25 of the Act had ousted the
applicability of section 103, Cr.P.C. in the
cases of narcotics. Reliance could be safely
placed on 2017 SCMR 1874. Further, said
Rules had placed no bar on Investigating
Officer to send samples beyond seventy-two
hours of the seizure, receive the F.S.L. report
after fifteen days and report so received to
place before Trial Court, as the same were
directory and not mandatory and could not
control the substantive provisions of Control
of Narcotic Substances, Act, 1997 and to be
applied in such a manner that its operation
would not frustrate the purpose of the Act
under which those Rules were framed.
Failure to follow R-4 & 5 of Control of
Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts)
Rules, 2001 would not render search, seizure
and arrest under Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 an absolute nullity and
make entire case doubtful, except for the
consequences provided in the Rules. Case
laws referred to 2006 YLR 340 & 2006
YLR_2925. Substantial compliance was
sufficient in directory provisions and even
where there was no compliance at all, act was

not invalidated by such non-compliance if act
otherwise was done in accordance with law.
Delay otherwise in sending incriminating
articles to concerned quarter for expert
opinion could not be treated fatal in absence
of objection regarding same having been

tampered with or manipulated.

13. Moreover, in the present case
prosecution has proved the custody of parcels
No.1 to 31 in the Malkhana of the police
station concerned prior to their dispatch to
FSL. Be that as it may, such omission on
their part would not be enough to cause any
cracks in the prosecution case against the
appellant as it was not the appellant’s case
that samples other than the separated one
were dispatched to FSL by the Investigating
Officer.

14. Furthermore, the time consumed
would not be taken into account for washing
out the prosecution case against the appellant
coupled with the fact that huge quantity of
narcotic cannot be foisted upon the appellant
by the police official to whom no malafide or
ill-will had been attributed by the appellant.
Delay in sending the samples to laboratory
due to rush of work is of no consequences in

view of huge quantity recovered from the
10

secret cavity of the vehicle under the direct
possession of the appellant. Reference can be
made to PLD 2009 SC 39. Besides, wisdom
can be also drawn from the judgments

reported in 2007 YLR_ 1962, 2007 YLR_ 1799

2006 MLD 747, 2005 YLR 529, 2006 YLR 2925,
2006 YLR 2504, 2006 MLD 361, 2006 YLR 340,
PLD 2006 Peshawar 176, 2005 PCrLJ 254, PLD
2008 Lahore 243, 2015 PCrLJ_ 30, 2013 PCrLJ
557, 2014 MLD 837, 2015 PCr.L.J_ 143 & 2010

MLD 1453.

15. Thorough and careful examination of the
case record shows that the prosecution has
successfully proved its case against the appellant
beyond any shadow of doubt through worth
reliable and convincing evidence. The impugned
judgment of the learned trial court is based on
proper appreciation of the case evidence to
which no exception could be taken by this court,
which is hereby maintained.

16. For what has been discussed above, this
appeal, being bereft of any merit, is hereby
dismissed.
