SAHIBZADA _ASADULLAH, J.- This judgment shall
dispose of two criminal appeals bearing Cr.A. No.22-B/2018,
titled Shah Naraz Vs. The State & Cr.A. No.24-B/2018, titled
Akram Khan Vs. The State, as both are arising from one and
the same judgment dated 24.01.2018, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court Banda Daud
Shah, Karak, in case FIR No.92 dated 02.4.2016, registered
under Section 9(C) CNSA at police station Gurguri, District
Karak, whereby both the appellants have been convicted
under section 9 (C) CNSA and sentenced to life imprisonment
with fine of Rs.1,00,000/- each or in default thereof to further
undergo six months simple imprisonment. Benefit of section

382-B, Cr.P.C was also extended to them.

2. The prosecution case, as disclosed in the F.IL.R
Ex.PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex. PA/1, is that on

02.4.2016, Shah Baraz Khan SHO (PW-4) alongwith police
contingent, after receiving spy information regarding
trafficking of Charas in a motorcar, laid a barricade at FRP
Check Post Amankot on main Gurguri Road, it was about
1200 hours, when a motorcar bearing registration No.ARS
281/Sindh, came from Gurguri side which was signaled to stop.
The driver in suspicious condition was deboarded therefrom
and was arrested under Section 54, Cr.P.C., who introduced
himself as Akram Khan. The motorcar was searched and on
the pointation of accused Akram, 21 packets containing
Gardah Charas concealed in the CNG cylinder fixed in the
trunk of the motorcar were recovered. The recovered
contraband was weighed on the spot through a digital scale,
1100 grams Charas in each five packets was found, whereas
sixteen packets contained 1050 grams each. The total
recovered Charas stood 22 Kgs and 200 grams. Five gram
sample from each packet were separated for chemical analysis
and sealed in parcels No.1 to 21, whereas the remaining
contraband was sealed in parcel No.22. The seizing officer
prepared recovery memo Ex. PC/1 in this respect. The
motorcar alongwith its registration copy and the recovered
Charas were taken into possession and accused was booked in

the captioned FIR.

3. During course of investigation, the accused
confessed his guilt before the Investigating Officer as well as
before the Court of Judicial Magistrate on 05.4.2016, wherein

he besides confessing his guilt also nominated co-accused
3

Shah Naraz alias Hashim Daraz. On completion of
investigation against arrested accused Akram, complete
challan against him was submitted before the learned trial
Court. He was charged for the offence to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. During course of trial, co-accused.
Shah Naraz was arrested and supplementary challan was
submitted against him, so charge was re-framed by the trial
Court which was denied by both the accused who claimed to
face the trial. The prosecution, in order to substantiate charge
against the accused, produced and examined as many as
twelve (12) witnesses, whereafter, accused were examined
under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they professed innocence
and false implication, however, neither they opted to be
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C., nor produced
evidence in their defence. Learned trial Court, after hearing
both the sides, vide impugned judgment dated 24.01.2018,
convicted the accused and sentenced them, as mentioned
above, which has been assailed by the appellants in separate

appeals.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for appellants and
the learned Additional Advocate-General, representing the

State heard and record scanned with their able assistance.

5. It was on 02.4.2016, that Shah Baraz Khan SHO
received information regarding trafficking of Charas in a
motorcar, so he alongwith police Najfri laid a barricade at FRP

Check Post Amankot on main Gurguri Road, meanwhile at
4

about 1200 hours, a motorcar bearing registration No.ARS
281/Sindh, appeared from Gurguri side which was signaled to
stop. On inquiry the driver could not satisfy the police which
increased the suspicion, so the driver was taken into custody
under section 54 of the Cr.P.C., who introduced himself as
Akram Khan. The motorcar was searched and on- the
pointation of accused Akram, 21 packets containing Gardah
Charas concealed in the CNG cylinder fixed in the trunk of
the motorcar were recovered. The recovered Charas was
weighed on the spot which stood 22 Kgs and 300 grams.
After arrest of the convict/ appellant the motorcar was taken
to the police lines Karak, whereon 06.04.2016 with the help
of official mechanic Abdul Qayyum alongwith private
mechanic further 14 packets containing charas was recovered
from its secrete cavities, which was taken into possession vide
recovery memo Ex: PC, which on wieghment stood 17 Kgs ©
and 560 grams. Out of each packet five grams Charas was
separated for chemical analysis which were sealed into

separate parcels and so the remaining contraband.

6. The record transpires that the appellant Akram
Khan was arrested on the spot and huge quantity of narcotics
was recovered from his motorcar on his pointation. The test
samples were dispatched to the office of chemical examiner
for analysis wherefrom a positive report was received. The
prosecution produced as many as 12 witnesses and all the

witnesses remained consistent on material aspects of the case.
5

The motorcar was taken into possession and no rival claimant
turned up to claim its ownership and even the appellant could
not disassociate himself from the car in question. The
witnesses were put to lengthy cross-examination but nothing
favourable could be extracted from their mouth to favour the
appellant. The record is silent that what mala fide was
attributed and proved against the witnesses who arrested and
effected the recovery. The quantity recovered was huge and
we see no reasons that witnesses were so interested that the
contraband was planted against the appellant to implicate him
in the instant case. There is nothing on record that either the
Investigating Officer or the seizing officer had any personal
grudge with the appellant, which could result in planting the
narcotics against the convict/ appellant. The mode and
manner of arrest has left no room to disbelieve the
prosecution. Though the seizing and Investigating Officer
were thoroughly cross-examined regarding the recovery, its
weighment and dispatch to the office of chemical examiner,
but nothing was brought which could discredit these
witnesses, as they went coherent and consistent.

All went well with the seizing and Investigating
Officer and never ever they deviated from the procedure laid
down for the purpose. The defence failed to create dents in
the prosecution case and even the visit to the spot by the
seizing officer alongwith police nafri interception of the

motorcar, arrest of the accused and recovery of the
6

contraband is established on record and such was the status of
the Investigating Officer whose testimony could not be
discredited. Though the learned counsel for the appellant
pointed out some contradictions in the statements of the
witnesses but those were trivial in nature and cannot be made
basis for dislodging the prosecution case. The contradictions
so referred did not strike the material aspects of the case as
the recovery stood proved and the confession of the convict/

appellant increased its worth.

7. The investigation was conducted honestly after
observing the legal and procedural formalities and we sense
no malafide on part of the witnesses to falsely implicate the
appellant in the case. The recovery of the contraband is
proved on record and even the constable who took the test
samples to the office of the chemical examiner has been
examined as PW-09, who stated that it was he who took the
test samples to the laboratory for its chemical analysis. The
recovery was effected on 02.04.2016 whereas the test samples
were received by the laboratory on 04.04.2016, which
excludes the possibility of tempering with the parcels, while
in transit. No mala fide was suggested to this witness and
even his veracity was not questioned. The learned counsel for
the appellant stressed that no private witness was associated
with the process of recovery and that even the Investigating
Officer did not record the statement of the informer and to

him the recovery was effected in utter disregard of law. We
are afraid that the learned counsel for the appellant went
ignorant of section 29 of the Control of Narcotics Substances
Act, 1997, which has done away with such formalities. Even
otherwise police officials are as good witnesses as others are,
that too when no mala fide was either alleged or proved

against them as is held in case titled “Abdur Rashid Vs the

State (2009 SCMR 306).

“The prosecution witnesses being
members of the raiding party were the
natural witnesses and their testimony
cannot be discarded merely on the
ground that they were the employees of
the police force.”

8. The accused after his arrest was produced
before the Judicial Magistrate, where he confessed his guilt
and explained that how he came into possession of the
contraband and he also named the other appellant i.e. Shah
Naraz as the owner and himself attained the status of a carrier.
The Magistrate was examined as PW-6, who was thoroughly
cross-examined but nothing detrimental to the case of the
prosecution was brought on record, he stated that the convict/
appellant was produced before him and sufficient time was
provided to him to think over again and again and after
fulfilling the legal formalities his statement was recorded. The
accused was produced on 05.04.2016 before the Judicial
Magistrate, where he opted to confess and so his confession
was recorded. The learned Judicial Magistrate while

recording the confession of the accused has followed the
8

procedure and also put the needed questions and it was then
he got satisfied and recorded the statement. The appellant was
warmed time and again that he was not supposed to make
confession, the Magistrate got satisfied that no threat,
influence or coercion was used. The learned counsel for the
appellant stressed that when the subsequent recovery was not
admitted by the appellant then the confession so recorded
holds no ground as to him the Court is either to accept or
reject the confession holistically, but we are conscious of the
fact that had the subsequent recovery been effected in his
presence or on the day then we could say yes to the defence,
but as the later recovery was effected in absence of the
accused, so to our mind the same cannot dislodge the case of
the prosecution, when so this Court is left with no other
option but to hold that the confession is voluntary and

deserves respect.

In case titled “Shaukat Ali Vs_ the State and

another” (2019 SCMR 577), wherein it is held that:

“Though the appellant when
indicted claimed trial and retracted
from his confessional statement
during his examination under
Section 342 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898,
nonetheless, on a _ careful
examination we have found his
confessional statement free from

all taints. Seemingly voluntary

9

without duress or inducement;
inculpatory in nature the
confessional statement reflects a
complete and truthful narration of
event leading to deceased's death.
The learned Magistrate has taken
due care to administer necessary
warnings to the appellant and
recorded each detail thereof in his
own hand. It does not appear to
have been fabricated to advance
prosecution's case and thus can be
squarely relied upon without any
reflection on safe administration of
criminal justice. It is by now well
settled that a retracted confession
can form basis for conviction if

found voluntary and truthful.”

9. We have two recoveries before us, one that was
effected on 02.04.2016 when the convict/ appellant was
arrested and the other on 06.04.2016, when the convict/
appellant was confined in the judicial lockup, the subsequent
recovery could not be proved against the appellant as, when
the motorcar was intercepted and was thoroughly searched
only the recovery from the CNG Cylinder fitted to the car was
effected and subsequent recovery was effected by the time,
when the appellant Akram Khan had already been sent to the
judicial lockup. At the time of initial recovery the seizing
officer thoroughly searched the vehicle but no further
recovery from the secrete cavities could be made and it was

on 06.04.2016, when further recovery was effected, the

10

subsequent recovery could not be proved against the convict/
appellant as the mode and manner in which it was effected is
shrouded in mystery and also the appellant was not present, so
to this extent the prosecution failed to establish the link

between the appellant and the subsequent recovery.

10. The principal accused Akram Khan after his
arrest was produced before the court of Judicial Magistrate
and it was then when he introduced one Hashim Daraz being
the actual owner and the police went in search and at the end
arrested the appellant Shah Naraz. The Investigating Officer
was asked that how Shah Naraz was arrested as Akram Khan
has mentioned the name of co-accused as Hashim Daraz, the
Investigating Officer replied that in fact Hashim Daraz was
the nickname of Shah Naraz of which the principal accused
was not in the knowledge. This explanation was not only
strange rather it surprises us as to wherefrom this information
was collected that too when he was not previously known to
the Investigating Officer. The Investigating Officer did not
record the statement of any person who could say that it was
he who disclosed the name of the appellant. The only
evidence against the appellant Shah Naraz is the statement of
the principal accused and even the principal accused did not
mention his name rather he mentioned one Hashim Daraz to
be the owner of the charas and motorcar. The prosecution
failed to collect evidence on record where the involvement of

the appellant could be established and even after his arrest

il

nothing incriminating was recovered either on his pointation
or from his possession, so much so the prosecution could not
bring on record his previous involvement in such like cases,
when so this Court reaches to a conclusion that the
prosecution could not establish the charges against the
appellant Shah Naraz and his. involvement was the only
confessional statement of co-accused which cannot be made
the sole basis for his conviction, being circumstantial
evidence. In this respect Article 43 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat
Order, 1984 gains significance which reads as:-

43. Consideration of proved confession

affecting person making it and others jointly

under trial for same offence: When more

persons than one are being tried jointly for

the same offence and a confession made by

one of such persons is proved,-

(a) such confession shall be proof against the

person , making it and;

(b) the Court may take into consideration

such confession as circumstantial evidence

against such other person.

Explanation: “Offence’” as used in this

Article, includes the abetment of or attempt to
commit the offence.

11. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
its case against convict/appellant Shah Naraz. So, Cr.A.
No.22-B/2018 is accepted, the conviction and sentence
awarded to the appellant Shah Naraz by the learned trial
Court/Judge Special Court is set aside and he is acquitted of
the charges levelled against him. He be set-at-liberty

forthwith, if not required to be detained in connection with

aly

oe

12

any other criminal case, however, the prosecution proved its
case against the convict/appellant Akram Khan. Resultantly,
criminal appeal No.24-B/2018, is devoid of merit stands

dismissed.

12. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of even date.
