QALANDAR_ ALI KHAN, _J.- Shakeel Khan,
petitioner, invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court
under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 561
Cr.P.C for quashment of the order dated 18.10.2018 of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Nowshera,
whereby earlier order dated 09.10.2018 of the said
Court was reviewed/cancelled/recalled.

2. The petitioner was on the driving seat of
Carry Van No.AFV-266/ICT, wherefrom heroin
weighing 10300 grams was recovered and _ the
petitioner alongwith co-accused occupying the front
seat, namely, Muhammad Ishaq son of Yar
Muhammad and Abdul Ghani son of Sharbat Khan
present on the rear seat, all residents of Jamrud,
Khyber Agency, were arrested and booked by the local

police of Police Station Akbar Pura, Nowshera, vide
FIR No.189 dated 10.08.2018 under section 9 (c)
CNSA. The co-accused, namely, Abdul Ghani and
Muhammad Ishaq were granted bail by this Court vide
order dated 28.09.2018; and following the bail
granting order of this Court, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II/Judge Special Court, Nowshera, also
granted bail to the petitioner vide order dated
09.10.2018; which was reviewed/cancelled/recalled by
the same Court vide the impugned order dated
18.10.2018, primarily, on the ground that after bail
order in favour of the petitioner, FSL report was
received, reporting tampering of chassis number of the
vehicle, besides making further observations with
regard to direct charge against the petitioner ‘who was
found on the driving seat of the vehicle’, wherefrom
huge quantity of contraband was recovered which
could not be considered as without knowledge of the
person occupying driving seat of the vehicle, and
further that report of the laboratory was also received
in positive.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned AAG heard; and record perused.
4. It may be observed, at the very outset, that
instead of moving this Court for cancellation of bail
granted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge to

the petitioner involved as a driver of the vehicle
wherefrom huge quantity of heroin weighing 10300
grams was recovered, the State, through the Deputy
Public Prosecutor, Nowshera, preferred to move bail
cancellation application to the same Court, which
opted to cancel bail granted to the petitioner on the
ground that after bail order in favour of the petitioner,
FSL report was received showing chassis number of
the vehicle tampered; while totally overlooking this
fact that bail was granted to the petitioner/accused
under section 9 (c) CNSA, which could not be
cancelled/recalled/reviewed on the said ground of
tampering of chassis number of the vehicle in the light
of FSL report; where-under neither the accused was
yet arrested or granted bail by the forum below so as to
justify cancellation of bail there-under by the
Additional Sessions Judge. In addition to the FSL
report showing chassis number of the vehicle tampered
with forming basis for cancellation of bail, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge also pointed out in the
impugned order that the petitioner was driving a
vehicle, containing huge quantity of contraband, who,
while occupying driving seat of the vehicle could not
be deemed to have had no knowledge of the
contraband in the vehicle and that report about samples
of contraband sent to the laboratory was also received

in positive. Such order, among other things, would
suggest afterthought and late realization on the part of
the prosecution as well as the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I], Nowshera, that a driver of the
vehicle wherefrom huge quantity of heroin weighing
10300 grams was recovered, was released on bail vide
earlier order of the same Court dated 09.10.2018.
Therefore, in an apparent effort to camouflage the
earlier bail order, the bail was
cancelled/recalled/reviewed on the pretext of FSL
report showing chassis number of the vehicle tampered
with; which is not sustainable; and ought to be set at
naught for being contrary to the legal provision
governing cancellation of bail; but, with the
observation that if the prosecution was so keen to get
the bail cancelled, it could and should move the higher
forum i.e. the High Court for the purpose, instead of
adopting a course which was not provided for in the
circumstances of the case.

5. Consequently, while taking serious notice of
the unwarranted deviation from the proper legal course
of correcting a wrong; and, also leaving open option of
moving for cancellation of bail granted to the
petitioner, the instant petition is accepted to the extent
of cancellation of bail by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Nowshera, vide impugned order

dated 18.10.2018 on the ground of FSL report showing
chassis number of the vehicle tampered with. Needless
to say that this order shall have no bearing on merits of
the fresh bail cancellation application by the

prosecution before the proper forum, alluded to

hereinabove.
