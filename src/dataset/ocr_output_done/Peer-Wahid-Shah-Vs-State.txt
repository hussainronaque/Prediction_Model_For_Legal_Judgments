ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI,_J.- Being

unsuccessful before the two courts below to get the
concession of bail, petitioner Peer Wahid Shah, through this
further petition, seeks the same concession from this Court
in case FIR no.413 dated 21.08.2015, registered under
sections 324/337-F (ii)/337-A_ (i)/382/148/149 PPC, in
Police Station Jungle Khel Kohat wherein he alongwith
co-accused Riaz ud Din, Amjid ud Din and Wajjad ud Din,
is charged for attempting at the life of complainant Syed
Ajm ud Din by giving him dagger blows and firing at him,
as a result, he sustained injuries. A land dispute has been
alleged as motive behind the incident.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the record that complainant
has not sustained any firearm injury. The two injuries, one

on right hand and the other on ear of the complainant, have

been observed by the medical officer to be result of sharp
weapon. The role of giving dagger blows and firing has
been simultaneously, assigned to four accused including the
petitioner. Three co-accused named above, whose role as
per contents of FIR is identical to that of the petitioner have
been granted bail by the learned lower court against which
no bail cancellation petition has been filed either by the
State or complainant, therefore, on the principle of
consistency the petitioner would also be entitled to bail. The
only ground which prevailed before the learned lower court
while declining bail to the petitioner was that in the site
plan the role of fatal dagger blows has been attributed to
him, but this aspect of the case when no such role fatal has
been given to the petitioner in the report, would by itself
makes the case of the petitioner arguable for the purpose of
bail. Besides, keeping in view the let off, of the
complainant who was in the clutches of four accused,
intention of the accused to kill/applicability of $.324 PPC,
is yet to be determined during trial after recording evidence.
Punishments of other offence with which the petitioner is
charged do not fall within the Prohibitory Clause of $.497
Cr.P.C., therefore, in the circumstances, I am inclined to

exercise the discretion of bail in favour of the petitioner.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided hefurnishes
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local,
reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like amount to
the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD
concerned.
