The above extract from the inquiry
report clearly shows that the petitioner produced
before the local police the original registration and
transfer letter of the vehicle besides the same have
duly been verified by the Motor-Vehicl Registration
Authority, Excise & Taxation Department,
Islamabad. The inquiry further reveals that the said
Authority has denied the verification of transfer

letter produced by the respondent No.2 by terming
the same as blank one. The inquiry report also

reveals that the petitioner produced sale deed of the

vehicle before the local police who recorded

statement of Abdul Musta’an from whom the

petitioner purchased the vehicle in question against

sale consideration of Rs.25,00,000/-. Similarly, the

local police also recorded statement of Akbar Khan

son of Itbar Khan who purchased the same vehicle

from one Noor Muhammad against sale

consideration of Rs.28,00,000/- and sold out the

same to Abdul Musta’an. Hence, according to the

inquiry report of the local police, the petitioner is

last owner and possessor of the vehicle in question,

being a bona fide purchaser thereof.

In this regard guidance can be sought

from the judgment delivered in case of “Kadirming

Vs. The State_and another (1998 SCMR 2542)

wherein custody of vehicle was handed over to

petitioner therein on the basis of facts identical with
those of the present case. The relevant portion of the

judgment is reproduced as under:-

“ We are of the view that no exception
can be taken to the impugned order of the
High Court, inasmuch as the recovery of
the omni bus was made from the driver
of Ghulam Hyder and besides, the name
of Ghulam Hyder was also found
mutated in the relevant Excise and
Taxation record. As to whether such
mutation had resulted upon fraud being
practiced by illegally tilling up the blanks
in the transfer papers etc. are questions
which must await due determination at

the level of the Civil Court.”

Yet in another case having identical

facts reported as 1992 SCMR_ 1454 the august

Supreme Court observed that:-

“It cannot be denied that the van was
seized from the possession of the
appellant. It is yet to be seen whether the
documents produced by the appellant in
the Civil Court are based on forgery or
not and it is only the Civil Court which
can determine the question of title. Prima
facie appellant is entitled to the custody

of van in dispute.”
Tajanul vs

Record shows that the vehicle in

question was seized from the petitioner and his name

is mutated in record of the Excise and Taxation

Department. In that respect original registration

book, transfer letter and sale/purchase deed from the

last owner are part of the record. In addition to the

above, statements of the witnesses also supports the

petitioner’s version, hence, prima facie the petitioner

is entitled to the custody of vehicle. So far as

contention of the respondent No.2, is concerned, he

has nothing in support of his ownership of the car

except a blank transfer letter and a report to the

Political Agent Bajaur Agency that the vehicle is

stolen one. However, question of title of the vehicle

in question is still disputed which cannot be

determined by this Court while exercising its

jurisdiction under section 561-A, Cr.P.C and the

proper forum for this purpose is the Civil Court,

therefore, both the parties should approach the said
forum for determination of question of title of the

vehicle in question.

5. For what has been discussed above, this

quashment petition bearing Q.P No.11-M/2015 is

allowed, the impugned order of the learned Sessions

Judge/Zilla Qazi, Dir Lower at Timergara dated

05.3.2015 is set aside/quashed. Consequently,

custody/supardari of the vehicle in question is

handed over to the petitioner subject to his

furnishing surety bond in the sum of Rs.25,00,000/-

(rupees twenty five lac) with two sureties each in the

like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa Judicial

Magistrate/MOD who shall ensure that the sureties

are local, reliable and men of means.

Above are the reasons of my short order

of the even date.

Announced.
