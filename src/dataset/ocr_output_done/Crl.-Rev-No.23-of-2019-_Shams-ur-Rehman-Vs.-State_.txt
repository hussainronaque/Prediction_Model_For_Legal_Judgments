Crl. Revision No.23-P of 2019

Shamas-ur-Rehman Vs. State

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 08.11.2019

Mr. Muhammad Riaz, Advocate, for petitioner.

Malik Akhtar Hussain Awan, AAG, for State.

AHMAD ALL, J.- The petitioner being aggrieved of the
order dated 29.01.2019 of the learned Sessions Judge
Mardan, passed in the proceedings under Section 514
Cr.P.C. only to the extent of remarks recorded therein
again him, has filed present revision petition for the

expunction of same.

2. The shorts facts of present petition are that accused
Naseeb Khan and Gulsher were granted transit bail to
appear before the competent court at Rawalpindi. The
accused submitted bail bonds whereby the petitioner
being Nazim of Union Council Roriyar Jadeed, Mardan
stood verifier of the sureties namely Hijab Gul, Ghani

and Taza Gul. Nevertheless, the accused failed to appear
before the concerned Court at Rawalpindi and
proceedings u/s 514 Cr.P.C. were initiated against the
sureties. They were given notices u/s 514 Cr.P.C. to
which they replied and finally vide order dated
29.01.2019, the learned Sessions Judge Mardan forfeited
one-half (1/2) of the amount of bail bond burdened each
of the sureties to deposit an amount of Rs.100,000/- in
favour of the government or to suffer six months S.I.
However, the learned Sessions Judge Mardan, in the and
Para at page No.4 of the impugned order, noted certain
adverse remarks against the verifier (now petitioner) and
issued directions to the Secretary Local Government,
Government of K.P.K. Peshawar to initiate proper action
under the law against the petitioner, who was Nazim of
the Union Council at that time. Therefore, aggrieved of
the adverse remarks in the order dated 29.01.2019, the

petitioner approached this Court through the present

petition.
3. Arguments heard and record gone through.
4. A thorough perusal of the impugned order reveals

that the learned court below after forfeiting the bail bonds
of sureties, recorded certain remarks in the impugned
order against the present petitioner who, at that time, was

the Nazim of Union Council Roriyar Jadeed, Mardan and
also. directed the Secretary Local Government
Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to initiate action
against him. The learned court below was of the view
that “The role of identifier of the bail bonds, namely,
Sham-ur-Rehman, Nazim U.C. Roriya Jadeed, Tehsil &
District Madan in this case remained very dirty. He had
performed the role of a tout in this case, which is not
expected from an elected representative. He has not only
cheated the sureties but has also tried to practice fraud
upon the court by verifying such sureties who are not
enjoying good reputation due to their previous
involvement in such like cases.---” These observations of
the learned court below are without any backing and the
record. There is no cavil with the proposition that while
granting transit bail to accused persons, no responsibility
was placed at the identifier/verifier of sureties nor any
direction to be followed by the identifier was there. The
role of identifier/verifier of the bail bonds is limited to
the extent that he verifies the sureties to be local
residents. Now, it is upon the Court to determine as to
whether the sureties are reliable and men of means, if so,
it can proceed further to accept the bail bond otherwise to
reject it. in the case titled “Muhammad Salim Vs. The

State” (PLD 1970 Karachi 187) it was held:
“When a person offers to stand surety
and submits his documents for
verification it is for the Court to
determine his solvency and his fitness
for standing as surety for that person.
The Magistrate cannot act on the
opinion of another authority, such as
the City Deputy Collector. The
judicial function necessarily implies
that it must be his own judgment and

not that he could act otherwise.”

Reliance, in this regard, is also placed on the
judgment of this Court in the case titled
“Muhammad Sarwar Vs. The State” (PLD 1965
(W. P.) Peshawar 14) whereby the practise of
verifying security bonds by the Tehsildar or
requiring police to report on suitability or
otherwise of surety was highly criticized and it was
held that it is sole prerogative of the court to

ascertain the fitness or otherwise of the surety.

5. Apart from above, the impugned observations
regarding acting of petitioner as a ‘tout’ are without any
record and evidence recorded in this regard. If sureties

were cheated by the petitioner, they had to complain
about it before proper forum for taking legal action
against the petitioner. Impugned order reveals that a
proper opportunity was given to the sureties by giving
them notices u/s 514 Cr.P.C. whereas, no opportunity
was afforded to the petitioner to justify his position. The
impugned observations against petitioner are hit by the
doctrine of ‘audi alteram partem’ and therefore, the same

are unwarranted.

6. In view of the foregoing discussion, this petition is
allowed and impugned adverse remarks recorded against
petitioner in the judgment dated 29.01.2019 are hereby
expunged.
