JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, J:- By invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
Ali Bahadar, the petitioner, seeks issuance of an
appropriate writ directing the respondents to hand
over/return Toyota Pickup Hilux Double Cabin bearing
engine No.2L-9148487, chassis No.LN85-703491 and
registration No.6457 (to be referred hereinafter as “the
vehicle in question”) to him unconditionally.

2. He averred in his writ petition that the vehicle in

question, assembled by Toyoto Indus Motor Company
(Ltd)/respondent No.1, was sold to Honda Power Cars
(Pvt) Ltd/respondent No.2, vide sale certificate No.11248
dated 15.05.1994. Respondent No.2 applied for its
registration to Motor Registration Authority and Excise &
Taxation Officer, Karachi/respondents No.10 and 11,
respectively. Ultimately, registration book of the vehicle in
question was issued along with original file and
computerized number plates. Later, respondents No.2 sold
the vehicle in question to M/S Arif Khan &
brothers/respondent No.3 vide sale deed dated 07.04.1997
with its registration No.6457. The vehicle in question was
then purchased by one Purdil Khan from respondent No.3
vide sale deed dated 07.04.1997, who transferred its
ownership in his name. The vehicle in question was then
purchased by one Mujeeb ur Rehman/respondent No.5,
who also transferred its ownership in his name. Thereafter,
the petitioner purchased the vehicle in question vide sale
deed No.8 dated 09.01.2011. He approached respondents
No.10 and 11 for its transfer in his name. In the meantime,
the vehicle in question was seized by Sher Muhammad
Inspector, Directorate General of Excise and Taxation,
Peshawar/respondent No.8 from possession of petitioner’s
son; resultantly an FIR was registered against the petitioner
in the year 2013 by the above named inspector, hence, this

writ petition.
3. The respondents have filed their para-wise
comments, wherein stance of the petitioner has been
refuted. The respondents have asserted in the comments
that according to FSL report, chassis number of the vehicle
in question has found tampered.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

5. With regard to entitlement of petitioner for custody
of the vehicle, suffice to say that though according to
Registration Authority, registration number of the vehicle
in question is genuine, however, as per FSL report, its
chassis number has been found deciphered. In this view of
the matter, we, are not inclined to hand over custody of the
vehicle in question to the petitioner, as it will amount to
issuance of a license by the Court for plying a tampered
and un-authorized vehicle on road.

6. On the other side, we have noted with great
concern that the vehicle in question had been taken into
custody by Sher Muhammad Khan Inspector and FIR was
registered against the petitioner on 12.09.2013, but till
date, no challan has been submitted against the petitioner.
On 25.09.2018, when this case came up for hearing,
following order was passed by this Court:-

“We have noted with great concern that the
vehicle was taken into custody by the Excise
Squad and FIR was registered by Inspector

Sher Muhammad Khan against the petitioner
in the year 2013. Since then, the vehicle of
petitioner has been kept in custody by Excise
Department in their possession without any
proceedings in the case. In the early hours,
Inspector Nauman Akhtar present in Court
was asked about the whereabouts of the
vehicle, who stated that the same has been
parked in the Excise Warehouse, Swabi, thus
he was directed to produce the same before
this Court. After_an_hour, the Court _was
apprised that the vehicle has been brought
loaded _in_ truck, as it is _not_in_ running

condition.

Since the vehicle has been taken into
custody by the Excise Department in the year
2013 and has been parked under open sky
without any care or has been misused and
mishandles by the officials. The learned
counsel for the petitioner informed that the
questioned vehicle has been gifted by the
Excise authorities to the Provincial Minister
of Excise Department for his personal/family
use. Be that as it may, admittedly the vehicle
remained in possession of Excise authorities
since 2013, so they are responsible to bring it
in original condition with all its tools and
accessories. They are directed to produce the
same on the next date of hearing in its original
position before the Court on 3.10.2018, failing
which the law will take its own course. In
case of missing of any item in the vehicle in
question, Sher Muhammad Khan, Nauman
Akhtar Inspectors and Iqbal AETO, will be

responsible.”
7. Photographs of the vehicle in question have been
brought on file, which depict that it has been completely
deteriorated/damaged because of its rough handling,
therefore, is not in running condition. The Government of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Excise and Taxation Department,
under section 43 read with section 23 and sub-section (4)
of section 25 of the Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance,
1965, has framed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Road Checking
Seizing and Disposal of Motor Vehicles Rules, 2015,
(hereafter to be referred as the Rules of 2015). Rule 3 of
which empower the seizing officer to seize vehicles on the
grounds enumerated therein which also includes vehicles
having suspicious chassis number. Rule 4 of the Rules of
2015, speaks qua safe parking of seized vehicles. It
provides that soon after taking possession of the vehicle
under Rule 3, the seizing Officer shall prepare inventory

in Form “A” in quadruplicate. One copy of the receipt

shall be given to the person from whom the vehicle is
taken into possession while the second copy, along with
the vehicle, shall immediately be sent to the Officer in
charge of the warehouse for safe parking of the vehicle.
The third copy shall forthwith be sent to the District
Officer, along with a brief report, who shall inform the
concerned Deputy Officer along with a brief report, who
shall inform the concerned Deputy Director and such

Deputy Directory shall further inform the Director
General, accordingly. The fourth copy of the receipt shall
be kept by the Seizing Officer for his own record.
According to rule 4(2) of Rules 2015, the Officer incharge
of the warehouse shall enter Form “A” and other
particulars of the vehicle in a separate register to be
maintained by him in “Form B” as well as in the database
specially designed for the purpose and such officer shall
be responsible for the safe custody of the vehicle till its

disposal in accordance with these rules. (The bold and

underlines are supplied for emphasis). As per law and
Rules, on receipt of report, the District Officer was under
laden duty to issue a notice to the owner of last
possessor/keeper of the vehicle through registered post
with acknowledgement due, asking him to appear before
the District Officer and establish his bona fide ownership
and possession within two weeks. In case of appearance of
the owner or keeper, the District Officer shall decide the
case within two weeks, failing which, the case shall be
referred to the Director Excise and Taxation for extension
of time, who may grant extension for a period not more
than thirty days. In the case in hand, a notice under Rule
6 (c) of the Rules ibid, has been shown issued to the
petitioner, but without acknowledgment due, whereas,
there is manifest tampering in the date of its issuance,
which is sufficient to disclose that the alleged notice has

not been issued at all, rather prepared later on to fill-up the
lecuna of file, after taking cognizance of matter by this
Court.

8. Nothing is available on record to show that in
pursuance of above mentioned so called notice, the
petitioner/owner has not attended the office of District
Officer, even then, the Officer Incharge Warehouse made
recourse to Rule 7, as a result, publication was issued in
daily Mashirq dated 06.03.2014, however, thereafter
unnecessarily, the vehicle was kept in custody. The District
Officer Excise & Taxation was bound under Rule 8 of
Rules ibid to proceed with the case and should have been
confiscated the vehicle through a speaking order, followed
by an open auction through an “Auction Committee”. It is
a pity that in a case like this, the vehicle has been seized on
12.09.2013, but proceeding has not yet been completed.
Since 2013, till date, the Seizing Officer along with
Warehouse officials, have not move a step ahead in the
case. The fate of the vehicle in question has purposely
been left undecided. Neither it has been parked in safe
place nor dealt with in accordance with the mandatory
provision of Rules referred to above.

9. For what has been discussed above, the writ sought
by the petitioner is declined. However, we are of the
considered view to hold that respondents/ Excise and
Taxation Department has not dealt with the vehicle in

question in accordance with the mandatory provisions of
the Rules referred to above, therefore, a copy of this order
be placed before the Secretary Excise and Taxation,
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the direction to probe into the
matter as to why disposal of case has unnecessarily been
delayed and as to why the vehicle in question has not been
kept in safe place and to take legal action against the
delinquent Official(s), under intimation to this Court
through the Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court,
positively. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) shall pursue
the matter with the worthy Secretary Excise and Taxation
Department, Peshawar, and apprise the Court about the
progress.
