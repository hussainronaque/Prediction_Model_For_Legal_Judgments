JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANT, J.- At a trial

held by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IIJ, Kohat,
appellant Habib Khan, having been found guilty of
committing the murders of Abdul Saboor deceased, vide
judgment dated 02.07.2012, has been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to undergo
‘imprisonment for life’ and to pay Rs.1,50,000/-, as
compensation in terms of $.544-A Cr.P.C. to LRs of the
deceased or in default thereof, to undergo 06 months S.I.,
further. Benefit of $.382-B Cr.P.C., has been extended to
him.

2. Through the instant appeal, appellant has
questioned his conviction and sentence, while connected
Cr.R. No.106-P/2012, has been filed by petitioner-

complainant, seeking enhancement of sentence of the

convict-respondent from life imprisonment to normal
penalty of death, as provided under the law.

3. Since, both the matters are the outcome of one
and the same judgment of the learned Trial Court dated
02.07.2012, therefore, this common judgment shall
govern the same.

4. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report is that, on 09.10.2004 at 09.20 hours,
complainant Sajid Mehmood (PW.5), in company of dead
body of his father Saboor Khan deceased, reported in
Police Station Lachi, that on the fateful day, Habib Khan
(appellant-convict herein) alongwith Khana Gul and two
unknown co-accused, later on, named as Hussain Bahadar
and Aurangzeb (acquitted), duly armed with
Kalashnikovs, visited their house, met with his father in
Baithak and after taking tea, when they were about to
leave, appellant Haib Khan and acquitted co-accused
Khana Gul, opened fire at his father, as a result, he got hit
and died on the spot. After the incident, the accused
decamped from the crime scene towards hills. In addition
to complainant, the incident is stated to have been
witnessed by PW Mst. Minhaja (abandoned). A monetary

dispute has been alleged as motive behind the incident.

5. On the report of complainant, Mir Shah Alam
Khan (PW.7) registered FIR Exh.PW.7/1 No.202 dated
09.10.2004, under sections 302/34 PPC, Police Station
Lachi. He also prepared injury sheet and inquest report of
deceased Abdul Saboor Exh.PW.7/2 and Exh.PW.7/3,
respectively, and shifted his dead body to the mortuary for
postmortem examination, where doctor Javed Ali Shah
(PW.2), conducted autopsy and opined the cause of death
of the deceased to be firearm injuries to his vital organs
i.e. heart, lungs and blood vessels. Time between injury
and death was observed by him as “5 to 10 minutes”
while between death and postmortem as “3 to 4 hours”.
Mir Shah Alam Khan Inspector (PW.7), then rushed to the
spot and prepared site plan Exh.PW.7/4 on the pointation
of complainant. During spot inspection he secured
bloodstained earth Exh.P.1, from the place of the
deceased and 10 crime empties of 7.62 bore from the
places of the accused vide recovery memo Exh.PW.7/5,
recorded statements of the PWs under section 161
Cr.P.C., took into possession the last worn bloodstained
garments of the deceased, sent by doctor from the
hospital through constable Mian Dad vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.7/6, sent the bloodstained articles and empties to

the FSL, report in respect of the bloodstained articles is

Exh.PW.7/7. He produced PWs Khalid and Sajid
Mehmood, before the learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate
for recording their statements under section 164 Cr.P.C.,
wherein they nominated unknown culprits to be Hussain
Bahadar and Aurangzeb (acquitted co-accused). Since,
accused were avoiding their lawful arrest, therefore, he
initiated proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C.
against them and on completion of investigation he
handed over case file to the SHO, who submitted challan
in terms of S.512 Cr.P.C. against the accused.

6. Initially, accused Hussain Bahadar was
arrested, tried and ultimately acquitted by the learned
Trial Court/ Additional Sessions Judge-II, Kohat vide
judgment dated 11.01.2007. Subsequently, accused Khana
Gul and Aurangzeb were arrested, tried and finally
acquitted vide judgment dated 27.03.2014, by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Kohat. Record divulges
that against acquittal of the above named accused, no
appeal has been filed either by the complainant or by the
State.

7. Finally, accused/appellant Habib Khan was
arrested and on completion of necessary investigation,
supplementary challan was submitted against him before

the learned Trial Court, where he was formally charge-

sheeted, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
To bring home the guilt of the appellant, prosecution
examined seven witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statement of the appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the
prosecution allegations and professed his innocence. He,
however, declined to be examined on oath under section
340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned Trial Court, after hearing
both the sides, convicted and sentenced the appellant as
mentioned above.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court is against
the principle of appreciation of evidence as the same set
of evidence which had been disbelieved qua acquitted
co-accused, has been believed against the appellant
despite the fact that his role is akin to that of the acquitted
co-accused, particularly accused Khana Gul, who like the
appellant had been attributed the role of firing at the
deceased; that no shred of evidence, much less tangible,
has been led to prove the effective shots on the person of
the deceased to be the result of firing of the appellant; that
no appeal has been filed against acquittal of co-accused,

therefore, the acquittal findings of co-accused have

attained finality and in the circumstances the learned Trial
Court was not justified to record conviction of the
appellant on the basis of same set of evidence which has
already been disbelieved; that case of the appellant being
at par with the acquitted co-accused, he also deserves
acquittal.

9. Learned AAG assisted by learned counsel for
the complainant while supporting the impugned judgment,
sought dismissal of the appeal and requested for
enhancement of sentence of the appellant by accepting the
revision petition.

10. We have’ considered the respective
submissions advanced from either side and perused the
record carefully.

11. A look over the First Information Report
reveals that in all four accused have been charged by
complainant Sajid Mehmood (PW.5), out of whom,
appellant Habib Khan and acquitted co-accused Khana
Gul, have been named and have been attributed
specifically a general role of firing at the deceased. The
two unknown accused mentioned in the FIR were
nominated, later on, by the complainant Sajid Mehmood
and PW Khalid to be Hussain Bahadar and Aurangzeb, in

their statements recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C..

Three accused, namely, Hussain Bahadar, Aurangzeb
and Khana Gul, have been acquitted vide judgments
dated 11.01.2007 and 27.03.2014, respectively, against
which no appeal has been filed by the complainant or the
State, as such findings of their acquittal have attained
finality. The role of the present appellant is not
distinguishable from acquitted accused Khana Gul, as
both of them have been charged by the complainant for
firing at the deceased without attributing the fatal shots on
the person of the deceased to any of them. Same set of the
prosecution evidence, has been disbelieved by the learned
Trial Court while recording acquittal of co-accused
including Khana Gul. No shred of evidence, much less
tangible, has been led by the prosecution to distinguish the
role of the appellant from the acquitted co-accused Khana
Gul, to prove that it was only the firing of the appellant
which hit the deceased. The appellant has not confessed
his guilt before the competent court of law nor has any
crime weapon been recovered either from his direct or
indirect possession or on his pointation. FSL report qua
the crime empties depicts that these have been fired from
more than one weapon. After acquittal of co-accused
Khana Gul, to whom same and similar role like the

appellant has been attributed, how in absence of strong

corroboratory evidence, the appellant can be convicted on
the same quality of evidence, which has been disbelieved
qua the co-accused and no appeal has been filed against
his acquittal. We are surprised while going through the
impugned judgment, as the learned trial Court has not
discussed the evidence under which it came to the
conclusion that the role of the appellant was different
from that of acquitted co-accused Khana Gul and that it
was the appellant whose fire shot landed on the person of
the deceased. We are conscious of the fact that the
doctrine of “falsus in uno falsus in omnibus” has been
done away with in criminal justice system of the country
and now the golden principle of “separating the grain
from the chaff’ is followed while appraising the
evidence, but on thorough scrutiny and assessment of the
testimony of the complainant Sajid Mehmood we
observed it indivisible getting no strong and independent
corroboration from unimpeachable source to distinguish
the role of the appellant i.e. to prove that it was the firing
of the appellant which proved fatal, therefore, we are
helpless in applying the golden principle of sifting grain
from the chaff. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case
titled, “Ghulam Sikandar Vs Mamraz Khan (PLD

1985 SC 11), has laid down a guiding principle to the

effect that when case of the convict is not distinguishable
from that of the acquitted accused and the evidence is
indivisible in nature then in the absence of strong
corroboratory evidence, coming from independent source,
the same cannot be made basis for conviction qua the
convict. Same is the view of the august apex Court in
case titled, “Muhammad Banaras Vs the State” (2002
SCMR 1855). In case titled, “Irfan Ali Vs the State”
(2015 SCMR 840), it has been held by the Apex Court:-
“that that whenever witnesses were found
to have falsely deposed with regard to the
involvement of one _ co-accused then,
ordinarily, they could not be relied upon
qua the other co-accused unless their
testimony was sufficiently corroborated
through strong corroboratory evidence,
coming from unimpeachable _ source.
Evidence of a _ witness was divisible,
however, pre-condition was that evidence
of the same set of witnesses may be rejected
against some of the accused and it could be
relied upon with regard to the other set of
the accused, provided it was getting strong

independent corroboration from

10

unimpeachable source while recording
conviction on a capital charge”.
Deriving wisdom from the judgment of the august apex
Court (supra), the testimony of complainant Sajid
Mehmood, the solitary eyewitness, by no stretch of
imagination is divisible. Moreso, in his initial report he
has only assigned the role of firing to the appellant and
acquitted co-accused Khana Gul, but in his court
statement in cross-examination when he was confronted
with his earlier statement recorded in the trial of acquitted
co-accused Hussain Bahadar, he admitted that in that very
statement he has also charged accused Hussain Bahadar
for firing at the deceased. On further confrontation with
his earlier statement, he deposed that he had correctly
stated therein that at the time of incident he had been sent
by his father for bringing milk and biscuit. This part of
statement of PW Sajid Mehmood is total deviation from
his earlier stance and amounts to dishonest improvements.
Besides, it also creates serious doubts about his presence
on the spot at the time of incident. We do not find any
strong independent corroboration from unimpeachable
source to distinguish the role of the appellant from that of
the acquitted co-accused, particularly, Khana Gul and

Hussain Bahadar, whose acquittals have attained finality.

11

12. For what has been discussed above, we have

reached to an irresistible conclusion that learned Trial

Court proceeded on wrong premises while recording

conviction of the appellant on the same set of evidence,

already disbelieved qua acquitted co-accused, squarely

ignoring the dictum of the Hon’ble Supreme Court on the

subject.

13. Accordingly, we by allowing this appeal, set

aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant

recorded by the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated

09.10.2004, and hereby acquit him of the charges levelled

against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required

in any other case.

14. On acquittal of convict/respondent, connected

Cr.R. No.106-P/2012, titled, “Sajid Mehmood Vs Habib

Khan etc” has become infructuous, which stands

dismissed as such.

These are reasons of our short order of even

date.

15. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
Court is directed to communicate copy of this judgment to
Mr. Amjad Zia Siddiquee, the learned Trial Judge/ the
then learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Kohat for

future guidance.
