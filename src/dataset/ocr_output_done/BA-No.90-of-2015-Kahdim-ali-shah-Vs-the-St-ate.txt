JUDGEMENT

Date of hearing 21.04.2015

Appellant-Petitioner: Khadim Ali Shah by Mr. M. Sadiq
Khan, Advocate.

Respondent: Mr. Shaukat Khan, Advocate for

Respondent.

Mr. Qudrat Ullah Khan, Astt: AG for

the State.

MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J.--- Having

remained unsuccessful in obtaining bail from the two

courts below, vide orders dated 11.03.2015 and

08.04.2015 passed by the learned Judicial magistrate-II,

and learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Bannu,

respectively, the accused/ petitioners Khadim Ali Shah

and Farmanullah alias Parveen involved in case FIR No.

219 dated 28.02.2015 under sections 376/363/337-J/34

PPC, Police Station City, Bannu have now come up to
-2-

this court for the same relief through the application in

hand.

2. According to the FIR lodged at the behest of

complainant Faizullah, the allegations against the

accused/petitioners are that they on 28.02.2015 at

morning time, Mst. Muskan Bibi, aged about 9/10 years,

student of Class second was going towards Govt. Girls

Primary School, Gardanali, Bannu City, and when

reached at chowk Bazar, Bannu city, she was caught

hold of forcibly by two unknown persons, who

intoxicated her through nose due to which she became

un-conscious. On coming conscious she was lying on

roadside, whereafter she returned home. Thus it came to

surface that rape has been committed with her. Initially

the report was lodged against unknown persons, but

subsequently the accused/ petitioners were nominated,

when her statement was recorded under section 161

Cr.PC before the local police on 02.03.2015.
-3-

3. At the very outset, learned counsel for the

petitioners contended that compromise has been effected

between the parties and thus the complainant /father of

the alleged victim Mst. Muskan Bibi, has no objection

over release of petitioners on bail.

Learned counsel for the complainant/

respondent has also stated that he has no objection if the

accused/petitioners are released on bail.

However, the learned Asstt: Attorney

General strongly refuted the arguments of both the

learned counsel for petitioners and complainant mainly

on the grounds that the present offences are not

compoundable, that the same offences are categorized as

high moral turpitude one and are heinous in nature so that

State is not bound by the act of the father of victim of

effecting compromise with the accused /petitioner.

4. On merits, it was the contention of learned

counsel for the petitioners that if the statement of victim

is taken into consideration, even then the case under
-4-

section 376 PPC is not made out against the petitioners,

as the victim was a consenting party. He, therefore,

argued that the petitioners/ accused are charged for

ulterior motive.

5. I have thoroughly gone through record of

the case and anxiously considered the argument

addressed at the bar by learned counsel for the parties.

6. Perusal of record reveals that both the

accused/ petitioners are directly charged by name by the

victim/minor girl, aged about 9/10 years, in her statement

recorded under section 161 Cr.PC for committing rape

upon her by making her unconscious with some

intoxicant.

7. The contention of learned counsel for the

petitioners that the victim being a consenting party, the

provision of section 376 PPC are not attracted is

misconceived, because according to section 375 PPC, a

man is said to commit rape, who has sexual intercourse

with a women, with or without her consent when she is

under sixteen years of age, while in the instant case the
-5-

victim is aged about 9/10 years and was subjected to

intoxication before committing rape with a minor girl.

8. Similarly, the contention that the accused/

petitioners have been charged falsely with ulterior motive

is also misconceived, because it is not possible for a girl

of 9/10 years to falsely implicate the accused/ petitioners

in such an offence especially in the absence of any

motive, which could remain a stigma not only for her

life, but also for the whole family.

9. It is a case of commission of rape with a

minor girl by first making her unconscious. In this

respect the medical report shows that the hymen of minor

girl was absent which is sufficient to assess that she was

subjected to rap. Furthermore, two vaginal swabs and

sample of blood have been sent to FSL and DNA test, for

verification and report in this regard are still awaited and

nonavailability of such report does not entitle the

petitioners for the concession of bail. Report may be

relevant but not the sole criteria for the grant of bail and

in a case titled “Muhammad Naveed Vs State” (2000
-6-

SCMR_150)_ in same circumstance the apex Court

refused leave to appeal against the bail dismissal order

passed by the Lahore High Court in Criminal Misc:

No.3994-B/99.

10. The offence is of moral turpitude which can

destroy the entire psychology of a girl under 10 years of

age by putting her and the family to public shame. It is a

stigma with which her whole family has to face with and

is the most hatred crime. The plea of counsel

representing the father of victim that complainant has no

objection if the accused/petitioners are released on bail is

not tenable, because the State is responsible to save the

life, honour and dignity of every citizen specially women

and children. In the instant case a minor girl has been

subjected to rape in a very cruel manner. The argument

of learned Asstt; Advocate General representing the State

that forgiving the accused by father of victim in lieu of

Rs.600000/- amounts to giving justice in the private

hands, which is against the principle of modern

jurisprudence and law so the grant of bail in such like
-7-

cases on the basis of compromise is not permissible as

the offence is non-compoundable. The same view has

been taken in case titled “Muhammad Usman Vs_the

State” (2005 PCr.LJ 1181), wherein it has been held:

11.

“It is correct that the complainant has
endorsed the contention of the learned counsel
for the petitioner that a compromise has been
effected between the parties, but the
contention of the learned counsel for the State
cannot be brushed aside that compromise in
such-like cases is not permitted under section
345 Cr.PC, as offence of Zina is offence not
against the individual only but it is also
against the good conscience of the society.
Probably that is the reason that it has not been
included in the list of offences which are
compoundable.”

For the reasons discussed above I am not

inclined to admit the petitioners to bail and their prayer

for bail is accordingly declined.

Announced.
