SYED ARSHAD ALT, J.- Through this single
judgment, we propose to decide this criminal
appeal bearing No. 57-M/2015 as well as
the connected Criminal Revision bearing No.

17-M/2015, as both these matters emanate from

NAWABI/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
one and the same impugned judgment dated
07.03.2015 rendered by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi Swat at Kabal,
in case F.LR No. 58 dated 18.02.2014 under
sections 302,34 PPC registered at Police Station
Kanju District Swat, whereby the appellants
Bismillah Jan, Mohammad Ayaz, Inamullah and
Sajjad Ali were convicted under sections 302
(b)/34 PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment

2: The complainant Ahmad Khan,
PW-1 on 18.02.2014 at 11:40 hours reported the
matter to Umar Zada, ASI, PW-3 at the casualty

body of the deceased Sardar Ali wherein he
(complainant) charged the present
accused/appellants Bismillah Jan, Inamullah

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
and Sajjad for catching-hold of the deceased,
while the accused/appellant Mohammad Ayaz
stabbed the said Sardar Ali repeatedly with a
knife, due to which he (deceased) received
multiple injuries on his body and died at the
spot. The complainant also received body aches
and pain. The motive was disclosed to be a
dispute over the landed property.

3. Investigation in the case was
entrusted to Njjad Khan,S.1./C.1.0, PW-10, who
visited the spot and prepared the site plan Ex.
PW-10/1 at the pointation of the complainant
and other eye-witnesses. He has recorded

which the deceased Sardar Ali was stabbed by
the accused Mohammad Ayaz, the Investigation
Officer has taken into possession the said knife

the accused Sajjad Ex. P-6, mobile phones of
accused Muhammad Ayaz, Ex. P-7 and
Inamullah Ex. P-8 were taken into possession
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-5/1 (already
exhibited). Vide application Ex. PW-10/8, he
has produced the accused Sajjad before the
Court for recording of his confessional
statement but the said accused refused to record
his statement, therefore, he was sent to judicial
lock up. On 22.02.2014, vide application Ex.
PW-10/9 rest of the accused were produced
before the Court for recording of their

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
statements u/s 164/364 Cr.P.C but on their
refusal they were sent to judicial lock up. Vide
application Ex. PW-10/10 the recovered items
were sent to the FSL Peshawar for forensic
examination. On 25.02.2014, statements of the
PWs Saleem Jan, Khalid Khan, Fayaz Khan and
Ikram were recorded in the Court vide
application Ex. PW-10/11. On receipt of the
postmortem report of the deceased Ex. PW-6/2,
the same was placed on file. On receipt of the
FSL report from Peshawar, the same was placed
on record as Ex. PW-10/12 by the Investigation
Officer. On receipt of the Nagal Mad No. 24 of
the daily diary dated 18.02.2014, the same was
placed on record as Ex. PW-10/13. Upon
completion of the investigation, complete
challan was forwarded to the SHO concerned
for onward submission before the competent
Court.

4. During the trial, the prosecution
examined as many as 11 witnesses whose
statements were recorded and placed on file. On
closure of the prosecution evidence, accused
were examined under section 342, Cr.P.C,

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ge

wherein they denied the charges, claimed
innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla
Qazi Swat at Kabal convicted and sentenced the
accused/appellants vide the judgment impugned
herein, hence these connected matters.

6. The learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellants has argued that
the entire prosecution case against the present
accused/appellants is based on the testimony of
the interested and chance witnesses without any
corroboration, therefore, the impugned
conviction on this score alone is not sustainable
in the eye of law. He has further argued that the
impartial witnesses who could be the alleged
‘Jirga’ members were never produced before
the trial Court and one of the alleged star
witness of the prosecution Khalid Khan was
abandoned. Hence, the prosecution has failed to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt,
therefore, the accused/appellants are entitled to

be acquitted from the charges by giving them

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
the benefit of doubt not as a matter of mercy but
as their right.

7. Conversely, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant and the
learned State counsel while controverting the
arguments of learned counsel for the appellants
have argued that it was daylight occurrence and
the accused/appellants were properly identified.
There is no exaggeration of the charge and all
the witnesses were natural and unanimous in
their testimony regarding the guilt of the
accused/appellants. They have further argued
that the ‘Jirga’ members were only the property
dealers, therefore, their non-appearance before
the Court is not fatal to the prosecution case as
the criminal cases are always decided on the
quality of the evidence and not on the basis of
quantity of the evidence. They have further
argued that all the accused in furtherance of
their common intention have committed the
murder of the deceased in brutal manner which
was duly established at the trial. The medical
evidence and recovery of blood-stained
garments, grass etc. duly supported the

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
prosecution version. Hence, the impugned
conviction is based on proper appreciation of
evidence, which does not call for any
interference.

8. Arguments heard and record of the
case was perused with the valuable assistance of
learned counsels for the parties.

9. As per ‘Murasila’ Ex. PW-3/1
followed by FIR Ex. PW-7/1, it is the case of
prosecution that on 18.02.2014 at 11:40 A.M,
the complainant Ahmad Khan, PW-1 reported
the matter to the police official Umar Zada,
ASI, PW-3 at the casualty of Saidu Sharif
hospital accompanied by Saleem Jan, PW-2
who had brought the dead body of Sardar Ali
(deceased) that on the said day while he was
sitting in his electronic shop situated at
Koza Bandai, his maternal cousin Saleem Jan
PW-2 called him through his cellular phone that
he should come to his field situated at Terona
Shaheen Abad Koza Bandai as the Jirga
members had reached there. On _ such
information, he (“complainant’) and_ his
deceased brother Sardar Ali went to the spot. On

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
reaching there, the present appellants/convicts
namely Bismillah Jan, Mohammad Ayaz, Inam
and Sajjad had chanted abuses and then started
grappling and quarreling with them. Accused/
appellants Bismillah Jan, Inam and Sajjad
caught-hold of his deceased brother, while
Mohammad Ayaz, the appellant/convict stabbed |
him repeatedly with knife, due to which his
deceased brother Sardar Ali received multiple
injuries on his body and died at the spot. He
(complainant) also received some minor injuries
on his body. The motive behind the occurrence
was a dispute over the landed property and the
occurrence was stated to have been witnessed
by Khalid Khan (abandoned witness) and
Saleem Jan, PW-2.

10. In support of the prosecution case,
the complainant Ahmad Khan appeared as
PW-1 and the eye-witness Saleem Jan was
examined as PW-2, whereas the 3rd eye-witness
Khalid Khan was abandoned by the prosecution.
The close perusal of their testimony as recorded
at the trial Court would show that the place of
occurrence is situated at a distance, which can

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-10-

be covered in 10/11 minutes’ by walk from the
house of the complainant. They had a dispute
over demarcation of the property and on the day
of occurrence, some elders/property dealers had
fixed the said date for demarcation of their
property which was the subject-matter of
dispute among the parties. Saleem Jan, PW-2 is
the maternal cousin of the complainant who
indeed invited them at the place of occurrence
and his house is situated at a distance of
500/600 feet from the place of occurrence.

11. The scrutiny of their testimony
would reveal that when the complainant and his
deceased brother reached at the spot, the
appellants/convicts chanted abuses which led to
a free fight/grappling between both the parties.
At the first instance, both the parties were
separated, the appellants/convicts were taken to
a side by Khalid Khan (abandoned witness),
whereas the complainant-party was taken to a
side by PW-2 Saleem Jan. In the meanwhile,
they once again were trying to fight and thus
Khalid Khan could not sustain the resistance of
the appellants and he fell down on the earth and

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-ll-

similarly Sardar Ali the deceased was also
pushing himself towards the
appellants/convicts, whereas the complainant
was still caught by PW-2 Saleem Jan and the
deceased succeed to free himself from Saleem
Jan PW-2 and thus there was once again fight
between the parties and as such _ the
appellants/convicts Bismillah Jan, Inam and
Sajjad caught-hold of Sardar Ali and
Mohammad Ayaz, the appellant/convict
repeatedly stabbed him with knife on various
parts of his body. It also discerns from their
testimony that all the accused/appellants other
than Mohammad Ayaz had spade and ‘Kassi’
with them. In the first episode, the complainant
as well as the eye-witnesses could not notice a
knife in the hands of the accused Mohammad
Ayaz, however, in the second episode they
could only notice the knife when the
convict/appellant Ayaz _ started _ inflicting-
stabbing blows at the deceased.

Both the witnesses remained

consistent in their testimony which could not be

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ja.

shattered despite a lengthy cross-examination by
the defence.

12. However, the learned counsel has
objected on the testimony of the above said two
witnesses on two grounds and has stated that
their testimony could not be believed because
they are not only related to the deceased but the
PW-2 Saleem Jan is a chance witness, therefore,
his testimony has to be ruled out from
consideration. The concept of a
related/interested witness was discussed
elaborately by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in “Nazir’s case reported _as PLD
1962 269°’, wherein it has been held:- "Interested
witness is a one who has a motive for falsely
implicating an accused person". In “Khalil Ahmed
vs_the State (1976 SCMR_ 161), the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan accepted the
testimony of the son of the deceased aged about
15 years, Similarly in Iqbal alias Bhala’s case
reported as 1994 SCMR 1 wherein it was held:-
“friendship or relationship with the deceased
will not be sufficient to discredit a witness

particularly when there is no motive to falsely

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
«j3)-

involve the accused”. However, it is well settled
principle of law that the evidence of a witness
cannot be discarded merely on the ground of
relationship; if the evidence of a related witness
is confidence inspiring, his presence at the spot
is established and he has no motive to falsely
implicate the accused. It was held by the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in_Muhammad
Waris’s case reported as 2008 SCMR 784:- “it
is true, that Muhammad Amin P.W was a
brother of Abbas deceased while Muhammad
Hanif P.W was a brother-in-law of the two
deceased persons but then nothing could be
brought on record by the defence which could
establish any ill-will, animosity or reason which
could have led the said two eye-witnesses to
falsely implicate the petitioner in the crime in
question and to falsely substitute him for the
actual offender”. Indeed, the statement of a
witness on account of being interested can only
be discarded if it is proved that the witness has
ulterior motive of falsely implicating an

accused, which is not the case here.

NAWABI/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
<i4<

13. Similarly, the assertion of the
learned counsel for the appellants that PW-2
Salim Jan was a chance witness, therefore, his
testimony should be out-rightly discarded does
not appear to be legally tenable. In the present
case, the house of PW-2 Salim Jan is situated at
a distance of 500/600 feet from the place of
occurrence and he has also justified his presence
at the spot because it discerns from the evidence
that the date on which the incident took place
was already fixed by the alleged ‘VJirga’
members for demarcation of the disputed
property. It was him (PW-2 Salim Jan) who
informed the complainant regarding the
demarcation of the disputed property. Hence,
when not only the said witness resides in the
close proximity of the place of occurrence but
has justified his presence at the spot then in
such circumstances his testimony is worth
consideration. Even regarding the chance
witness, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan
in “Elahi_Bakhsh’s_case_reported_as_ 2005
SCMR_810” has held:- “Jf chance witness
reasonably explains his presence at the spot and

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-15-

his narration of occurrence inspires confidence
then he is not a chance witness and his
testimony can be considered along with other
evidence”.

In absence of deep rooted enmity
between the parties and the principle laid down
by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
above-referred cases when the testimony of the
aforesaid two witnesses are confidence inspiring
then the same is worth consideration even
without any independent corroboration.

14. The ocular testimony also finds
support from the medical evidence. The Medical
Officer Dr. Mumtaz Ali Shah, PW-6 has
reported regarding the injuries as ‘’stab wound
with multiple injuries on chest, abdomen & back
and injuries to the lungs, heart & stomach with
extravasation of blood (loss of large amount of
blood) leading to death especially heart injury.
The time between the death and postmortem
was stated to be 1,1-1/2 hour’’. The postmortem
was conducted on 18.02.2014 at 11:43 A.M,
whereas the time of occurrence as per FIR is
10:30 A.M, therefore, the postmortem report is

NAWAB/PS" DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
~16:-

in line with the ocular testimony of the
eye-witnesses. Thus, the prosecution has
established the mode and manner of the
incident.

15. Similarly, the assertion of the
learned counsel for the appellants that despite
the fact that the independent witnesses i.e.
‘Jirga’ members were available on the spot but
their statements were not recorded before the
Court, hence, this fact renders the entire
prosecution case doubtful cannot be accepted,
because it is settled law that it is not the quantity
of the evidence but the quality of evidence
which is to be considered by the Court while
recording conviction of an accused. It is not the
rule of law that in all circumstances all the
witnesses who were present at the spot should
be produced before the Court, however, there
can be no rule of thumb in this regard and the
matter of consideration before the Court varies
from case to case. In the present case, when the
aforesaid two witnesses have established their
presence at the spot and their testimony is

confidence inspiring then the non-production of

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
oT Pa

the alleged ‘Jirga’ members who indeed were
the property dealers is not fatal to the
prosecution case.

Similarly, the crime weapon was
handed over by PW-2 Salim Jan to the
Investigation Officer on the following day of
the occurrence Ex. PW-10/3, hence the said
recovery cannot be attributed to the
accused/appellant Mohammad Ayaz. However,
the non-recovery of crime weapon from the
accused/appellant Ayaz is not fatal to the
prosecution case, because the prosecution has
established the case against the appellant Ayaz
by producing ocular evidence, which fully
support the prosecution story.

16. The next crucial point for
determination of this Court is as to whether the
appellants Bismillah Jan, Inamullah and Sajjad
Ali were sharing common intention with the
principal accused i.e. appellant/convict
Mohammad Ayaz who stabbed the deceased
Sardar Ali with a knife. The concept to award
similar sentence in addition to the principal
accused who had the common intention of

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
- 18 -

killing the accused has been embodied in
sections 34 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code
(“Code”). The role of co-accused who were
either present at the spot or had taken some
steps in commission of offence alongwith the
principal accused remained subject-matter
before the superior Courts for awarding
conviction to the said co-accused. In “’"Hameeda
Bano’s case_vs Ashig Hussain & another PLD
1963 109°’, the august Supreme Court has
elaborately discussed the concept of common
intention, wherein it was held:- "4 joint action
by a number of persons is not necessarily an
action performed with a common object. It may
be performed on the spur of the moment as a
reaction to some incident, and such a case
would fall more correctly within the rule of
constructive liability laid down in section 34,
P.P.C., which is based on "common intention",
a condition mind which is more directly and
proximately connected with the action than is
the formation of a common object. This may
appear more clear when it is recalled that the
law makes specific provision for dispersing an

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=f =

unlawful assembly. Such an incident is not
applicable to the jointness of action envisaged
in section 34, P.P.C., which consists of
translation of intention’, commonly held, into
effect. The persons who have in the present case
been held to have joined in a common assault
on the Thanedar can be more precisely held to
have acted with a common intention within the
meaning of section 34, P.P.C. than in
furtherance of a common object. The Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council have held in the
case of Mahbub Shah y. The King Emperor 72
IA. 148, that proof of pre-concert is necessary
in order to bring a criminal act performed by
several persons within the ambit of section 34,
but in a later case that of Mamand v. The King
Emperor A I R 1946 PC 45, it was clarified that
the existence of such pre-concert could be
established even by proof of acts performed by
individuals afier the completion of the main
crime. Even regarding the case in the light of
the requisite of pre-concert, there seems no
doubt whatsoever that such a consensus can be

achieved among the participants in the crime

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=9G<

immediately before its execution, e.g. where the
crime is excited by some action on the part of
the person against whom it is committed."

In ‘’Khair Muhammad alias

Khairoo vs the State PLD 1975 S.C. 351’, the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan regarding the
common intention of the co-accused has held:-
"It is not inconceivable that where several
persons belonging to a single party are already
present at the spot, they might suddenly develop
common intention or even common object at the
spur of the moment and commit the illegal act in
prosecution or furtherance thereof. In fact quite
realistically such an eventuality was been
clearly envisaged in the "Explanation" to
section 141, P.P.C. which says that an assembly
which was not unlawful when it assembled may
subsequently become an unlawful assembly".

In ?Hassan_Din’s case __vs
Muhammad _Mushtaq_and_2_ others 1978
SCMR_49’’, the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan although declined leave against the
acquittal of certain accused tried under section

302, 34 PPC has inter alia observed that

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-21-

“under section 34 vicarious liability cannot be
visited unless some strong circumstance exists
showing common intention and that mere
presence of a person on the spot does not
necessarily attract section 34, P.P.C.”’

In °Muhammad Riaz alias Riasti

and another vs the State 1987 SCMR 177’, in

respect of the common intention the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan has held:- ‘’In the
above case, one appellant inflicted dagger blow
while the other appellant threw brickbat on the
face of the fallen victim. It was urged before this
Court that the accused who threw brickbat, did
not know that the other co-accused was
carrying knife or that he would stab deceased in
abdomen and thus did not share common
intention to murder. The above contention was
repelled and it was held that from his throwing
brickbat on the face of the deceased after he had
been stabbed in the abdomen, it was evident
that he shared intention with the co-accused on
spot to murder the deceased. The appeal was
dismissed and the judgments of the two Courts

below were maintained.’’

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
In “Gheba & others vs the Crown

PLD 1949 Lahore 453” the august Division
Bench of the Lahore High Court has observed:-
“Common intention within the meaning of
section 34 implies a prearranged plan. To
convict the accused of an offence applying
section 34 it should be proved that the criminal
act was done in concert pursuant to the
pre-arranged plan. It is no doubt difficult if not
impossible to procure direct evidence to prove
the intention of an individual; it has to be
inferred from his act or conduct or other
relevant circumstances of the case. Care must
be taken not to confuse same or similar
intention with common intention; the partition
which divides "their bounds" is ofien very thin;
nevertheless, the distinction is real and
substantial, and if overlooked will result in
miscarriage of justice. The inference of common
intention within the meaning of the term in
section 34 should never be reached unless it is a
necessary inference deducible from the

circumstances of the case."

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
~23i-

Similarly, in “Khalil & another vs
the State PLD 60 (West Pakistan) Karachi
38’’, the august Division Bench of the Karachi
High Court regarding the accused being sharing
common intention has held:- ‘*Common
intention is sometimes proved by direct
evidence, such as confessions or an approver's
testimony, but in most cases its determination
depends upon inference from acts done and
motives possessed, judged in the light of the
habits and notions of the class of people
concerned. Where for instance 3 or 4 armed
relatives burst upon a habitation, kill or injure 2
or 3 persons, and carry off a girl, the subject of
a dispute between the two sides, the only
reasonable inference is that these acts are
unified by a common intention possessed by
each, namely to use force even to the extent of
murder in carrying off the girl. But in the
present case, though the girl was the subject of
bitter dispute, and though both the appellants
came armed, yet no attempt seems to have been
made to carry off the girl apart from the oral

demand. True she ran away but not far, and

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-24-

nothing is said why she could not have been
pursued and captured. The only acts of Habib
are that he demanded surrender of the girl
armed himself and accompanied, Khalil also
armed. It appears to us that we cannot rule out
as beyond the bounds of reasonable probability
the inference that Habib had agreed that they
should both go to demand the girl and that they
should go armed in order to prevent an attack
upon themselves, and that the shooting by
Khalil occurred not as part of a common
intention, but as an independent act arising
from his loss of temper. We do not say that this
is the right inference, but merely that it is a
reasonable and probable inference. It is to be
remembered that in order to attract section 34 it
is not sufficient to prove that an offence is a
likely consequence of a common intention; the
prosecution must show that the offence
committed was covered by the common
intention. We see no reason to reject the
evidence of the eye-witnesses that Habib was

armed with a pistol."

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-25-

Lastly, the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan in its celebrated judgment

“Muhammad Akbar & 2 others vs The State

PLD 1991 Supreme Court 923, His Lordship

Mr. Ajmal Mian while referring to various
pronouncements as cited above on the subject
while speaking for the Court regarding the
common intention in Para 12 of the judgment
has held:- ‘’From the above-referred cases, it is
evident that a joint action by a number of
persons is not necessarily an action performed
with a common object, but it may be performed
on the spur of the moment as a reaction to some
incident and such a case would fall within the
ambit of section 34, P.P.C. However, it may be
pointed out that section 34, P.P.C. contemplates
an act in furtherance of common intention and
not the common intention simpliciter and that
there is a marked distinction between similar
intention and common intention and between
knowledge and common intention. It may also
be observed that mere presence of an accused at
the place of incident with a co-accused who

commits offence may not be sufficient to visit the

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
- 26 -

former with the vicarious liability, but there
should be some Wong circumstance manifesting
a common intention. Generally common
intention inter alia precedes by some or all of
the following elements, namely, common motive,
pre-planned preparation and concert pursuant
to such plan. However, common intention may
develop even at the spur of moment or during
the commission of offence as pointed out
hereinabove. Conversely common intention may
undergo change during the commission of
offence’’.

17. In context of the present case, the
appellant Mohammad Ayaz, who is a principal
accused had inflicted knife blows upon the
deceased Sardar Ali repeatedly and has caused
nine (9) injuries on his body, therefore, there is
no doubt that he had the intention to kill the
deceased and thus he was righty convicted by
the learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment. However, the role of co-accused
Bismillah Jan, Inamullah and Sajjad is to be
viewed in view of the law laid down by the

august Supreme Court of Pakistan as referred to

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=5f's

above. It is evident from the evidence, that
accused Bismillah Jan, Inam and Sajjad had
spade and Kassi at their hands and the fight
between the parties took place in two episodes.
In the first episode, there was a free fight
between the convicts/appellants and the
complainant-party, who were then separated by
Khalid Khan (abandoned witness) and PW-2
Salim Jan. However, in the second episode as
evident from the statement of the PW-2 the
deceased was pushing himself towards the
appellants/convicts and similarly the
appellants/convicts were also pushing
themselves towards the deceased/complainant-
party. Once again there was a scuffle, however,
despite the fact that the appellants
Bismillah Jan, Inam and Sajjad had spade and
Kassi with them at their hands but they did not
hit the deceased with the said tools and only got
hold of the deceased which is quite natural in a
free fight between the two parties. Mohammad
Ayaz, the appellant/convict although inflicted
repeated knife blows at the deceased but from

the conduct of the co-accused Bismillah Jan,

Inam and Sajjad it does not appear that they
were also sharing common intention with him.
If they had any intention to kill the deceased
they had a clear chance even in the first episode
of the fight to hit the deceased with the spade
and Kassi. It also discerns from record that the
complainant at the relevant time was at sheer
mercy of the accused-party i.e. co-accused
Bismillah Jan, Inam and Sajjad having spade
and Kassi ,therefore, if they had any intention to
kill the complainant-party, they had the
opportunity to even kill the complainant.

18. The overall impression of the
evidence would suggest that initially even all
the accused had no intention to kill the
deceased, however, at the spur of the moment it
happened that the appellant Mohammad Ayaz
had inflicted repeated knife blows upon the
body of the deceased, therefore, his this act is an
independent act on all counts, for which the
co-accused Bismillah Jan, Inam and Sajjad
cannot be burdened especially when there is no

evidence whatsoever on record which could

-29-

suggest that the co-accused were sharing
common intention with the principal accused
Mohammad Ayaz.

19. In view of the above prevailing
circumstances, we are constrained to partially
allow this appeal to the extent of
accused/appellants Inamullah and Sajjad Ali
sons of Bismillah Jan, the impugned judgment
dated 07.03.2015 rendered by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi,
Swat at Kabal is set aside to their exent,
resultantly they are acquitted of the charges
leveled against them and be released forthwith
from jail, if not required in any other case,
while the instant appeal to the extent of
convict/appellant Mohammad Ayaz_ stands
dismissed, thereby his conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial Court through the
impugned judgment is maintained. Since, the
accused/appellant Bismillah Jan has died in jail
on 07.08.2017 and to this effect confirmation
letter bearing No. 9302-WE dated 06.11.2018

alongwith death certificate are available on

record, therefore, the present appeal to his
extent stands abated.

20. Regarding the revision petition for
enhancement preferred by the complainant-
petitioner, we have noted that in view of the
present facts and circumstances of the case
particularly in eventuality when there was a free
fight between the parties, the conviction of life
imprisonment awarded to the accused/respondent
Mohammad Ayaz is justified and does not
warrant further enhancement. Therefore, the
criminal revision in hand for enhancement also
stands dismissed.

21. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
