PKK
SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, _J.- The appellant; Tariq
Mahmood alias Asif Khan, has called in question the judgment
dated 14.01.2021, rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Banda Daud Shah, District Karak, whereby, the
appellant was convicted under section 302(b) P.P.C. and
sentenced to imprisonment for life alongwith fine of
Rs.100,000/- and in default thereof, to undergo S.I for 06
months. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended in
favour of convict/appellant.

2. Complainant, Mst. Darkhona moved criminal revision
petition No.08-B/2021 for enhancement of sentence of
appellant. Since both the matters have arisen out of the same
judgment, therefore, we intend to decide the same through this

common judgment.
-2-

3. The prosecution case, as per contents of F.I.R ExPA, is
that, on 05.09.2013, complainant Mst. Darkhona, brought the
dead body of her deceased husband Sher Muhammad Khan to
the police station Gurguri, Karak and lodged report to the effect
that on eventful day, she alongwith her husband Sher
Muhammad Khan left their house for their field to cultivate
Mustard crop. When at about 08:00 AM, complainant
alongwith her husband was busy in cultivation of the crop,
appellant / convict Tariq Mehmood alongwith absconding co-
accused Sarwar Din duly armed, came there and started abusing
her husband and started firing at him with murderous intention,
due to which, her husband got hit and died on the spot. Motive
for the commission of offence is alleged to be previous blood
feud. Hence, the FIR.

4. After completion of investigation and arrest of the
accused / appellant, prosecution submitted supplementary
challan against him, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and examined as many as 13 witnesses.
On close of prosecution evidence, statement of accused was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither he opted to
be examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
nor wished to produce defence evidence. After hearing
arguments, the learned trial Court vide impugned judgment

dated 14.01.2021, convicted and sentenced the accused /
\y

-3-

appellant Tariq Mahmood alias Asif Khan as mentioned above.
Hence, the instant appeal and revision against the judgment of
conviction.

5. We have heard learned counsel for the parties alongwith
learned A.A.G for the State at length and with their valuable
assistance, the record was gone through.

6. In the incident, the deceased Sher Muhammad received
firearm injuries, who died on the spot and thereafter, his dead
body was shifted to the local police station, where the matter
was reported by the complainant and the appellant alongwith
the absconding co-accused were charged for the death of the
deceased. After making the report, the injury sheet and inquest
report were prepared, whereafter, the dead body was sent to the
doctor for postmortem examination. The investigating officer
after collecting copy of the F.LR, visited the spot and on
pointation of the eye witness, prepared the site plan. During
spot inspection, the investigating officer collected two empties
of 7.62 bore near from the places of the accused and
bloodstained earth from the place of the deceased. The
appellant was arrested on 06.09.2018, after his arrest, the
appellant was charge sheeted and faced trial before the Court of
Additional Sessions Judge, Banda Daud Shah, and after a full
dressed trial, the appellant was convicted as stated above.
Feeling aggrieved, the appellant approached this Court through

the instant criminal appeal.
-4-

7. The learned trial court dealt with the matter
comprehensively and after application of judicial mind to the
collected evidence, convicted the appellant vide the impugned
judgment.

8. __ As this being an appeal against conviction, so this Court
is under the obligation to reassess the already assessed evidence
and to ascertain as to whether the learned trial court was
justified in convicting the appellant. True that the matter was
promptly reported by widow of the deceased, but that alone is
not sufficient to hold the appellant guilty for commission of the
offence, rather the prosecution is under the obligation to prove
its case through independent witnesses. We feel it essential to
once again scan through the record, so to reach to a just and
correct conclusion.

9. The points for determination before this Court are that; as
to whether the complainant was present at the time of incident;
and as to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner
and at the stated time; and as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in bringing home guilt against the appellant and as to
whether the motive alleged was proved to connect the appellant
with the murder of the deceased.

10. The complainant was produced as PW-02 who stated that
on the day of incident, she left her house in the company of her
deceased husband to sow the mastered seed in their property;

that it was about 08:00 AM, when the accused attracted to the
-5-

spot, hurled abuses at the deceased and thereafter, started firing
at the deceased, who after receiving firearm injuries, fell to the
ground, died on the spot and the accused decamped from the
spot. She further stated that the dead body was shifted to the
local police station with the help of co-villagers, where the
matter was reported. The record tells that the house of the
deceased is situated at a short distance from the place of
incident, which could be covered within five minutes. It floats
on the surface of record that during the days of occurrence, the
deceased was a proclaimed offender whose arrest was required
in case F.I.R No.73 dated 08.08.2013 U/S 302/324/34 P.P.C,
Police Station Gurguri. The previous involvement of the
deceased in different criminal cases has put this court on guard
to apply due care & caution, so that miscarriage of justice could
be avoided.

11. The investigating officer prepared the site plan on
pointation of the complainant, where both the parties were
given specific points and from the place of incident alongwith
blood stained earth, two empties of 7.62 bore were also taken
into possession. This Court is to see as to whether the
complainant was present at the time of incident and as to
whether it was the complainant who shifted the dead body to
the local police station and reported the matter. The
complainant during her cross-examination, stated that soon

after the incident, the local police attracted to the spot and she is
-6-

further contradicted by the investigating officer when he stated
that on receiving copy of F.I.R, he reached to the place of
incident, where the complainant was called from her house who
came to the spot alongwith other people after 50 minutes of his
arrival. The complainant was examined on this particular aspect
of the case, who stated that she and others accompanied the
investigating officer from police station to the spot. The
contradictions between the statements of these two witnesses
leave no ambiguity in mind that the complainant could not
establish her presence on the spot at the time of incident.

12. The record is to tell as to whether the complainant in fact
visited the spot field with her deceased husband to sow the
mastered seed. We scanned through the record, but could not
come across any such evidence which could tell that on the day
of incident, both the deceased and the complainant visited the
spot field for the purpose. The investigating officer admitted it
correct that no agricultural instrument was taken into
possession nor any seed was lying on the spot. The
investigating officer disclosed that he did not record statements
of any independent witnesses regarding the ownership of the
property and even the complainant did not produce any revenue
record to confirm her stance. The site plan depicts and so
admitted by the investigating officer that the spot fields were
barren and no crop was available in the vicinity, what to say of

sowing the same. The investigating officer admitted it correct
is

-7-

that there were no signs of sowing the seeds in the fields.
Keeping in view the shortest distance of the house of the
complainant from the place of incident, the possibility cannot
be excluded that the complainant attracted to the spot, when she
was informed regarding the death of the deceased.

13. The presence of the complainant is hard to be believed,
as she admitted that soon after the incident, the local police
attracted to the spot. The situation tells that in fact the deceased
was done to death and nobody witnessed the incident, this was
on receiving information that both the complainant and local
police attracted to the spot. The complainant could not disclose
the names of the persons who shifted the dead body from spot
to the police station. It is pertinent to mention that despite
approach to the place of incident soon after the incident, the
local police did not record the report on spot, as in that
eventuality, the prosecution case would have suffered a lot, but
to make its case a success, the F.I.R was shown to have been
registered in the police station. The conflict between the
statements of the investigating officer and the complainant in
respect of their arrival to the spot for spot proceedings has
confirmed that the complainant was not present on the spot at
the time of incident. The involvement of the deceased in
numerous cases is evident from the record and even details of
the same were asked from the complainant as well as the

investigating officer, more particularly, during the days of
-8-

incident, the deceased was a proclaimed offender. When the
appellant and the absconding co-accused had blood feud with
the deceased then instead of killing the deceased, they would
have also killed the complainant, as she was the sole surviving
witness. No prudent mind would accept the choice exercised by
the accused in killing the deceased and leaving the complainant,
knowing the fact that she would depose against them before the
court of law. As the deceased was having a criminal history and
enmities in the vicinity, so many people must be after his blood
and in such eventuality, the possibility that he would have been
killed by someone else when he was found all alone cannot be
ruled out. Similar situation was beautifully dealt with in case
titled “Pasand Khan Vs The State” (2011 YLR_ 1664
Peshawar) in the following manner:

“As the deceased was having to his credit a
long criminal history and had earned many
enmities in the area as he was involved in
serious crimes thus, many people must be
after his blood. The possibility that he was
killed by someone else when he was found all

alone cannot be ruled out.”
14. The medical evidence is in conflict with the ocular
account, as while reporting the matter, the complainant stated
that when the appellant and the absconding co-accused attracted
to the spot, they hurled abuses at the deceased and thereafter,

fired at the deceased. The medical evidence tells that the
4,

-9-

deceased received firearm entry wounds on his back with its
exit on his chest, which belies the stance of the complainant.
Had the incident occurred in the mode & manner, then in that
eventuality, the deceased would have received firearm injuries
on his chest and not on his back, as admittedly, the deceased
was addressed by the accused before starting firing. When the
complainant realized this blunder, she made an attempt to
improve her statement and during her cross-examination, she
stated that when the accused wanted to kill the deceased, he
started fleeing from the spot and in that the eventuality, the
deceased received firearm injuries on his back, this
improvement on part of the complainant can be termed as a
dishonest improvement made with the sole purpose to bring the
medical evidence in line with the ocular account. Though, a
conscious attempt was made on part of the complainant to make
this Court believe the portrayed situation, but the same went to
the disadvantage of the prosecution. True that medical evidence
is confirmatory in nature and in case of direct eye witness
account, the same has a little role to play, but equally true that
when the prosecution fails to establish its case through
trustworthy witnesses, then in that situation, the medical
evidence gains importance and the present case is no exception.
15. During trial, an interesting situation arose when both the
sides wanted to satisfy each other through special oath and for

that purpose, arrangements were made by the learned trial court
-10-

and even statement of the complainant was recorded regarding
innocence of the appellant provided the appellant prepares to
take a special oath. The learned counsel for the appellant
wanted to reap the harvest of the proceedings conducted by the
learned trial court, but he failed to understand that in fact in
criminal cases, no special oath can be administered and if
administered, the same has no utility and cannot be taken into
consideration. Though, an attempt was made to convince this
Court that when the complainant wanted her satisfaction
through special oath then the same can only and only be
interpreted that she was not present at the place of occurrence
and that she did not witness the incident to have been
committed by the appellant and the absconding co-accused.
True that an attempt was made in that respect, but when no
sanctity is attached to the proceedings conducted by the learned
trial court regarding special oath, so the same cannot be taken
into consideration to believe or disbelieve the prosecution story.
The attending circumstances of the case lead us to draw an
inference that neither at the time of incident, the complainant
was present nor the purpose of her presence was to sow the
mastered seed is proved from the record. The attending
circumstances of the case makes the case of the prosecution full
of doubt and the same should be extended to the accused. In

this regard, reliance can be placed on case titled “The State

through P.G Sindh and others Vs Ahmed Omar Sheikh
-ll-

and_others” (2021 SCMR_873) in which the Apex Court

held as under:

“It is settled since centuries that benefit of

doubt automatically goes in favour of an

accused. Even if a single circumstance creates

reasonable doubt in a prudent mind regarding

guilt of an accused then the accused shall be

entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace

and concession but as a matter of right and

such benefit must be extended to the accused

person(s) by the Courts without any

reservation”.
16. It was stressed hard and hard that the collected empties
were sent to the firearms expert wherefrom a positive opinion
was received that those were fired from two different weapons.
The learned counsel for the complainant wanted to take its
benefit and submitted that the recoveries of two empties from
the spot corroborate the statement of the complainant regarding
the involvement of the appellant and another. As the
prosecution could not bring on record substantial evidence, so
the collected empties being supportive in nature, cannot be
taken into consideration to determine the fate of the appellant,
as the same can be taken into consideration only and only in
support of direct ocular account, which is missing and as such,
this important piece of evidence has lost its utility.
17. Another important aspect of the case was highlighted by

learned counsel for the parties that the scribe, who registered
-12-

the case and prepared the injury sheet and inquest report was
not produced. Whether the non-production of that particular
witness in itself is sufficient to discard the first information
report and the documents prepared. We are not ready to accept
that in such eventuality, both the F.LR and the inquest report
will lose its utility. As the complainant who reported the matter
duly thumb impressed the same and during trial, she reiterated
the contents of the F.I.R, so mere absence of the relevant
witness will not be sufficient to say goodbye to this most
important piece of evidence. The record tells that the learned
trial court made repeated efforts to procure the attendance of the
witness, but his attendance could not be procured, as he was not
willing to appear before the Court. His reluctance to appear
before the Court cannot be attributed to either side and as such,
we are not ready to put it to the benefit of one side and to the
disadvantage of the other. So far the injury sheet and inquest
report are concerned, as the same were duly endorsed by the
doctor and confirmed by the witness who appeared before the
court to verify the signature and handwriting of the concerned
doctor.

18. The motive was alleged as a blood feud between the
parties, but neither the complainant nor the investigating officer
could bring on record any evidence both oral as well as
documentary to confirm the blood feud between the parties. The

investigating officer did not record statement of any
-13-

independent witness in that respect. There is no cavil to the
proposition that motive is a double edged weapon, as it cuts
either way. If motive could be the cause to kill then the same
could be a cause for false implication. True that weakness or
absence of motive, in itself, is not sufficient to dislodge the
prosecution case provided the prosecution succeeds in
establishing its case through independent evidence, but in case
in hand, the prosecution could not succeed in bringing home
guilt against the appellant, as apart from the complainant, no
other evidence was either available or brought on record. The
circumstances do tell that it was because of the previous blood
feud that the complainant charged the two real brothers for the
murder of her husband. In this regard, reliance could be placed

on case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs The

State” 2019 SCMR 652:

“7, The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad (PW9)
has admitted murder enmity between the
parties and has also given details of the same in
his statement recorded before the trial court.
No doubt, previous enmity can be a reason for
the appellant to commit the alleged crime, but it
can equally be a reason for the complainant side
to falsely implicate the appellant in this case for

previous grouse.”

19. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above

brings this Court to a definite conclusion that the prosecution
-14-

could not succeed in bringing home guilt against the appellant
and that the impugned judgment is suffering from inherent
defects, which calls for interference. The learned trial judge
while passing the impugned judgment, misdirected himself both
in law and on facts of the case. The impugned judgment is,
therefore, set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charges.
He shall be released forthwith from confinement, if he is not
required to be detained in connection of any other criminal
case.

20. As the appeal of the appellant is allowed and he is
acquitted of the charges, so in such eventuality, the instant
criminal revision petition bearing No.08-B/2021 has lost its

efficacy. The same cannot proceed further and is dismissed as

such.
