6851 Karachi, S.I Raja Shoaib Ahmad (PW-2) arranged a

raiding party alongwith other ANF staff and held nakabandi at
the crime spot when at 19:40 hours the said bus coming from
Dara Adamkhel side was signaled to stop for the purpose of

alongwith him on the ‘Tapa’ disclosed his name as Meer
Khatam and the person sitting on the VIP seat disclosed his
name as Habib Khan s/o Gul Habib being 2™ driver of the
bus. On cursory interrogation all the three accused separately
disclosed and pointed out the presence of narcotics i.e. charas
garda hidden in both sides of the bus. He prepared the
pointation memo on the spot duly signed by the marginal
witnesses. As a precautionary measure, the owner/ conductor
of the bus namely, Meer Khatam, was asked to return the
ticket fare and luggages of the passengers to them and the
passengers were let free. The bus alongwith three accused
were brought to the Police Station for thorough search. During
search in the presence of the three accused and marginal
witnesses both the sides of the bus were opened with different
tools and on thorough search 79 packets of charas garda
which was wrapped in white envelopes as well yellow
solution tape were recovered which on weighment total turned
out to be 94.800 Kgs. 10/10 grams from each packet of charas
garda were separated for FSL examination while the

remaining packets were sealed into four plastic sacks. From

Rs.3500/- were recovered and from the personal search of

paper regarding purchase of the bus and Rs.9000/- were
recovered. Similarly from the personal search of Habib Khan,
2™ driver, his CNIC, driving license, mobile phone alongwith
sim and Rs.400/- were recovered. On further interrogation all
the accused separately disclosed that the actual owner of the
narcotics is one Farid r/o Bara Khyber Agency presently
resident of Karkhano Market Hayatabad. The accused-
appellants were arrested. The narcotics, the bus and personal
belongings of the accused were taken into possession through
recovery memo Ex.PW2/2 and the FIR ibid was registered
against the accused.
3. Investigation commenced and at its conclusion,
complete challan was submitted against the accused-
appellants before the learned trial Judge who after holding a
full dressed trial convicted and sentenced the appellants
through the impugned judgment, hence the appeal.
4. In order to prove its case, the prosecution produced five
witnesses in all.

PW-1 Syed Rahat Ali Shah AD ANF Lahore stated to

be posted as Assistant Director PS ANF Kohat during the
relevant days on completion of investigation submitted
complete challan (Ex.PW1/1) against the accused.

PW-2, Raja Shoaib S.I made the same narration as in
the FIR. He further stated to have drafted the FIR No. 03
dated 23.2.2013 which correctly bore his signature as
Ex.PW2/3, prepared the cards of arrest of the accused as
Ex.PW2/4 to Ex.PW2/6, recorded statements of the PWs, after
investigation handed over the parcels of samples, the
recoveries from the personal search of the accused and his
application to the FSL to the Moharrir of the PS for keeping
the same in safe custody of PS Malkhana and directed him to
send the parcels of samples to the FSL, prepared the rough
sketch of the place of occurrence as Ex.PW2/7. He also
drafted the application to the FSL for analysis of the samples
which is Ex.PW2/8 and sent a letter to the concerned MRA
through Assistant Director of the PS for verification of
particulars of the bus which is Ex.PW2/9. He also sent a
notice to one Iran Badshah co-accused which is Ex.PW2/10
and sent Parcha 12 of the two accused to PS Lathambar Karak
and PS Gulberg Peshawar and both have disclosed that the
accused are P.Os and involved in case FIR No. 555 dated
23.12.2010, PS Gulberg Peshawar under section 9 (c) CNSA.
The reports are Ex.PW2/11 and Ex.PW2/12 respectively and
in this respect the report and FIR were placed on record as

Ex.PW2/13 and Ex.PW2/14 respectively and the proclamation
letter from Police Station Gulberg is Ex.PW2/15. Since all the
accused disclosed that Iran Badshah and Abdullah Afridi were
their accomplices in the transporting of narcotics, therefore,
he searched for their accomplices but when they were not
available, he applied for the issuance of warrant under section
204 Cr.P.C against them vide applications Ex.PW2/16 and
Ex.PW2/17 respectively and _ thereafter applied for
proclamation of proceedings under section 87 Cr.P.C vide
applications Ex.PW2/18 and Ex.PW2/19 respectively. He

PW-3 Riaz Khan driver is marginal witness to the
pointation memo Ex.PW2/1 and has fully supported the
statement of PW-2.

PW-4 Mudassir Khan constable stated that on
25.2.2013 he was present on duty at Police Station ANF
Kohat when Attaullah Jadoon ASI/ Moharrir handed him over
79 sealed parcels of samples each of 10 grams of charas garda
having 2/2 seals of the monogram S.A of case FIR No.03
dated 23.2.2013 alongwith application of the I.O, English
docket and route permit for taking the same to the FSL
Rawalpindi and on return handed over the acknowledge
receipt to the Moharrir.

PW-5 Attaullah Khan Jadoon S.I stated that on
23.2.2013 he was present in the Police Station on duty at the
PS when the I.O on his return to the PS handed him over the
case property of the case, parcels of samples and the bus in
question for keeping them in safe custody and the I.O also
directed him to send the parcels of samples to FSL
Rawalpindi and on 25.2.2013, he handed over the sealed
parcels, original application of the I.O to the FSL, English
docket to constable Mudassir Khan who took the same to
Rawalpindi and on return handed over acknowledgement
receipt to him.

5. On closure of the prosecution evidence, the accused-

appellants were examined under section 342 Cr.P.C wherein
they denied the allegations levelled against them. However,
they neither opted to be examined on oath nor to produce
defence.

Arguments heard and record perused with the valuable
assistance of the learned counsel for the parties.
6. At the very outset, it was pointed out that Ijaz Khan
convict-appellant has since left this mortal world for his
eternal abode and thus the appeal to his extent abates.
7. In the present case, it was Raja Shoaib Ahmad S.I ANF
(PW-2) who set the ball rolling when on receipt of spy
information regarding smuggling of huge quantity of narcotics
from Peshawar to Karachi via Kohat through bus bearing
registration No. JA-6851 Karachi he acted promptly by
arranging a raiding party and laid a barricade at the relevant
spot and on the arrival of the concerned bus it was stopped.
Ijaz Khan, convict-appellant (since deceased) occupied the
driver’s seat and by his side, which in local jargon is known
as ‘Tapa’, convict-appellant Meer Khatam was sitting and the
front seat commonly known as VIP seat was occupied by
Habib Khan, being the second driver of the bus. On being
quizzed cursorily, they separately disclosed and pointed out
the presence of Charas Garda hidden in both sides of the bus.
While appearing as PW-2, he recorded his pretty lengthy
statement right from the receipt of spy information, laying of

nakabandi, arrival of the bus at the spot, presence of the
accused-appellants in the bus alongwith passengers and the
separate pointations made by the accused regarding the
presence of narcotics and the subsequent recovery of huge
quantity of narcotics weighing 94.800 KGs from the doors of
the bus. His detailed statement has been reproduced above. He
was subjected to a matching and of course, lengthy, taxing
and searching cross-examination on behalf of the appellants
and in the process every effort was made to bring his evidence
under some shadow of doubt, but PW-2 remained unruffled
and stuck to his stance. Rather, he made further disclosures
about certain facts which only came to limelight during his
investigation. In reply to a question, he “admitted as correct
that according to my investigation the bus in question was
purchased by Iran Badshah and Meer Khatam accused.” The
record reveals that both Iran Badshah and Meer Khatam are
the sons of one Shah Jehan and hail from Karak. An attempt
was made to pass on the ownership of the bus and the
narcotics hidden therein to Iran Badshah, Abdullah and Farid
as the appellants stated themselves to be the ordinary
passengers in the bus. However, they were neither found to be
in possession of the tickets while travelling to Karachi nor the
appellant Meer Khatam could give an explanation as to why
he made payment of the fare amount to the passengers on the

instructions of the ANF authorities after the bus was stopped
and taken to the Police Station in order to retrieve the huge
quantity of narcotics hidden in its doors.

8. PW-3 namely, Riaz Khan, who had accompanied the
raiding party also gave an account of the proceedings right
from nakabandi at Toll Plaza Indus Highway Kohat at 1840
hours, arrival of the bus from Dara Adamkhel, the presence of
31 passengers and the three appellants being the crew of the
bus, the respective disclosure of their names by the appellants
as well as the presence of narcotics in the bus. He also
witnessed the pointation memo (Ex.PW2/1) and the recovery
memo (Ex.PW2/2) whereby the I.O took into possession the
narcotics, bus and recoveries from the personal searches of the
accused-appellants. The entire case property including the bus
were very much present before the court during evidence. He
was also subjected to sufficient cross-examination, but he
remained steadfast and nothing favourable to the appellants
could be extracted from his mouth.

Similarly, Mudassir Khan Constable as PW-4 stated to
have taken the 79 sealed parcels of charas garda of 10 grams
each alongwith application of the I.O to the FSL at
Rawalpindi and thereafter brought the acknowledgement
receipt to the Moharrir. PW-5 namely, Attaullah Khan
Jadoon, vouched about the delivery of the case property to

him by the I.O on 23.2.2013 whereafter he kept the same in
10

the Malkhana of the PS and on 25.2.2013 sent the samples
through constable Mudassir Khan to FSL Rawalpindi.

9. During the course of arguments, the learned counsel for
the appellants launched a frontal attack on the prosecution
version and contended that though the appellants were on
board the bus at the relevant time but as passengers and not as
crew members as alleged in the FIR. She contended that the
appellants had nothing to do with the recovery so effected
from the hidden cavities in the bus as the actual crew of the
bus namely, Farid, Abdullah and Iran Badshah were let free
and the appellants were substituted in their place as accused.
She contended that even the bus belongs to Iran Badshah as
evident from the sale deed dated 10.1.2013 and the I.O in the
case also failed to perform his duty in order to lay his hands
upon the real culprits being owners of the bus as well as
narcotics.

We are afraid the arguments of the learned counsel for
the appellants hold no water. The presence of the appellants in
the bus at their positions mentioned above, stands amply
established. The complainant had only information about the
smuggling of narcotics by inter provincial smuggler namely,
Farid, through his agents but it was the appellants who during
cursory investigation separately pointed out the presence of
the narcotics stashed in the vehicle. During personal search of

appellant Meer Khatam, not only the registration book of the
11

bus was recovered but also a stamp paper regarding purchase
of the bus. Moreover, it was Meer Khatam who returned the
ticket fares to the 31 passengers on board the bus. The sale
deed (Ex.P-13) shows the sale of the bus in favour of Iran
Badshah s/o Shah Jehan resident of Rehmat Abad Karak who
is in turn the real brother of Meer Khatam s/o Shah Jehan
resident of Karak. As such it is not available to appellant Meer
Khatam to cry hoarse about the conduct of the raiding party.
10. During the course of evidence, the separation of
samples of 10 grams from each of the 79 packets, its handing
over by the complainant to Attaullah Jadoon (PW5), its safe
custody in the Malkhana and its onward delivery to constable
Mudassir Khan to be taken to FSL Rawalpindi did not come
under challenge from the appellants. The positive FSL report
in the shape of Ex.PW2/20 puts a final seal on the recovered
contraband to be Charas Garda.

11. Ina situation where the presence of the appellants in the
vehicle stood fully established and the PWs in one voice
stated about the recovery of huge quantity of narcotics
weighing 94.800 KGs from the bus whose value runs into
millions of rupees at the local level and much much higher
internationally, then the appellants appear to have been
tempted to make quick buck in one go. It was probably with
such a situation in mind when a poet in a satirical and

parodical mood said
12

12. It needs no reiteration that CNS Act, 1997 is a special

law and it has been specifically provided in section 29 of the

Act that presumption of the recovery of contraband items is

always deemed to be from the accused unless it is proved to

the contrary. Except for minor and negligible contradictions

which certainly do not strike at the roots of the prosecution

version, the case stands proved against the appellants to the

hilt leaving no room to doubt the veracity of the statements of

the PWs. Moreover, the PWs were not at all questioned about

any previous ill-will or animous with the appellants whereby

the latter could have been substituted with so called other

accused. Though the appellants have denied the prosecution

allegations in their stereotype statements under section 342

Cr.P.C, but mere denial of the charge and pleading innocence

without substantiating the same through cogent and

convincing evidence in the face of a strong prosecution case

cannot earn them acquittal.

In view of the foregoing position when the prosecution

case stood fully proved against the appellant, the learned trial

Judge recorded a proper and well reasoned judgment
13

according to law and evidence available on the record. The

impugned findings do not suffer from any illegality,

misreading or non-reading of evidence which could in turn

call for interference through the present appeal. Resultantly,

this appeal being meritless stands dismissed.
