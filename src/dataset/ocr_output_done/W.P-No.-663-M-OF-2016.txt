accepted and the post commander concerned
was directed to register F.L.R against the

petitioner.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
Respondent No.1 filed an application on
14.10.2016 under Section 22-A, Cr.P.C before
the leaned Sessions Judge/Justice of Peace,
Malakand at Batkhela for registration of F.I.R
against the petitioner. She stated in the
application that she is residing in a separate
room in the house of her brother Saeed-ur-
Rehman, who is abroad and there is no male
in the house except her and Mst. Nasrat, wife
of her brother. She alleged that on 19.09.2016
at 1:00 hours when she was present in her
room, the petitioner entered her house by
scaling over the wall and straightaway came
inside her room and thereafter committed rape
on her as she is crippled and could not move
freely, however, she made hue and cry on
which her sister-in-law came there, locked the
door from outside and went to Levy Post for
lodging a report. Thereafter the levy officials
came to her house, opened the door and took

away the petitioner after arresting him.
Respondent No.1 further alleged that due to
threats and fear of the Post Commander, not
only she and her sister-in-law did not charge
the petitioner rather lodged report against her
brother Abdur-Rehman under Section

107/151, Cr.P.C.

3. The learned Justice of Peace after
procuring report of the concerned Post
Commander in the matter, accepted the
application of Respondent No.1 vide order
dated 22.10.2016 and directed the Post
Commander, Levy Post Agra for registration
of F.LR against the petitioner under Sections
376/457 PPC consequent upon which the
above referred F.I.R was registered against the
petitioner, for quashment whereof he has filed
this petition by invoking the Constitutional

jurisdiction of this Court.

4. Learned counsel for the
petitioner, inter alia, contended that
Respondent No.1 has concealed the real facts
in her application which she filed before the

learned Court below with a delay of almost

(W.P No. W.P No. 663-M of 2016 Khurshid Khan Vs. Mst. Asia and others)
Tajamul/PS*

one month without giving any explanation in
this regard. He further contended that in fact
on 16.09.2016 at 2100 hours sister-in-law of
Respondent namely Mst. Nusrat Begum
telephonically informed the local levy officials
regarding presence of a stranger inside the
room of Respondent No.1, her husband’s
sister whereafter the levy officials came to
their house and found the petitioner inside the
house who duly explained that Respondent
No.1 had made a phone call to his father Jan
Muhammad who sent the petitioner for her
treatment as she was ill. He further contended
that statements recorded by Respondent No.1
and Mst. Nasrat, her sister-in-law, are
available on record wherein they have
categorically stated that the petitioner had
come to their house for treatment of
Respondent No.1 and that they do not charge
him for trespass or theft, hence, the
complainant has changed her previous version
that by itself has disbelieved her stance which
can be considered as a reasonable ground for

quashment of the FIR under the

Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz

(WP No. W.P No. 663-M of 2016 Khurshid Khan Vs. Mst. Asia and others)

Constitutional jurisdiction. Learned counsel
referred to Madd Repot No. 5 dated
20.09.2016 and contended that vide the said
report Respondent No.1 sought protection of
levy officials against her bother Abdur
Rehman and cousin Ahmad Sher etc as there
was a threat to her life. Learned counsel
maintained that at that time too Respondent
No.1 did not charge the petitioner but later on
after due consultation and deliberation made a
concocted story and charged the petitioner
under Sections 376/457 PPC with collusion
and mala fide. He also argued that the medical
report does not support the offence of Zina
and the entire police record is silent regarding
the alleged offences which shows that the
petitioner has been charged in a false case,
therefore, the F.I.R be quashed in the interest
of justice under the Constitutional jurisdiction.
Learned counsel concluded that the learned
Justice of Peace has acted beyond his
jurisdiction by administrating oath while
exercising executive powers, as such, the

impugned order suffers from illegality.

5. As against that learned A.A.G.
assisted by learned counsel for Respondent
No.1 repelled the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner and contended that
petitioner has committed a heinous offence by
committing rape on a crippled and helpless
girl, therefore, registration of the F.IL.R is not
an illegality. Further contended that the
burden is on the complainant to prove the guilt
of petitioner through evidence and the same
opportunity will also be available to petitioner
to rebut the allegations in accordance with
law, hence, quashment of the F.LR at this
stage will cause miscarriage of justice to
Respondent No.1. They submitted that this
writ petition be dismissed and the Post
Commander concerned be directed to proceed

with the investigation.

6. Arguments heard and _ record
perused.
Z. We agree to the submission of

learned counsel for the petitioner to the extent
only that the learned Justice of Peace acts in

executive capacity and he cannot record

statements on oath while seized of an
application under Section 22-A, Cr.P.C. The
judgment i.e 2012 PCr.LJ_776 (Lahore)
referred by learned counsel for petitioner is
relevant to this extent but at the same time we
are conscious of the fact that while
entertaining such applications the Justice of
Peace is under the statutory duty to order for
registration of the F.IL.R without getting into
the depth of the information and if in his
opinion prima facie a cognizable offence is
spelt out from the contents of the application,
he is left with no choice but to order the
registration of the F.I.R. Subsequently, during
the course of investigation the charge appears
to be false the complainant can be proceeded
under Sections 182/211 P.P.C etc. Wisdom in
this regard is derived from the judgment in the
case titled “Muhammad Bashir V/s. Station
House Officer, Okara_Cantt._and_others”
(PLD 2007 Supreme Court 593” wherein the

august Supreme Court held that:-

“40. Therefore, in our opinion, the only
jurisdiction which could be exercised
by an Ex-officio Justice of the Peace
under section 22-A(6), Cr.P.C. was to

(W.P No. W.P No. 663-M of 2016 Khurshid Khan Vs. Mst. Asia and others)
Tajamul/PS*

examine whether the information
disclosed by the applicant did or did
not constitute a cognizable offence and
if it did then to direct the concerned
S.H.O. to record an F.LR. without
going into the veracity of the
information in question, and no more.
Offering any other interpretation to
the provisions in question would be
doing violence to the entire scheme of
the Cr.P.C. which could not be
permitted”.

In light of the above principles
laid down by the Hon’ble apex Court and
keeping in view the allegation leveled against
the petitioner leading to a cognizable offence,
the justice of peace has rightly ordered for

registration of the F.LR.

8. The points raised by learned
counsel for the petitioner in the Constitutional
petition before this Court amounts to appraisal
of evidence which is not the duty of this Court
when seized of a Constitutional petition under
Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan.
We will refrain to discuss the merits of the
case as that would damage the case of
either side during the course of

investigation as well as at trial. Reliance

‘

is placed on “Col. Shah Sadiq V/s.

Muhammad Ashig and others” (2006 SCMR
276) wherein it has been observed that:-

“Constitutional jurisdiction of High
Court--Scope--- If, prima facie, an
offence had been committed, ordinary
course of trial before the Court should
not be allowed to be deflected by
resorting to constitutional jurisdiction
of High Court---High Court had no
jurisdiction to quash FIR by
appreciation of documents produced
by the parties without providing
chance to cross-examine or confronting
the documents in question--- High
Court would err in law to short circuit
the normal procedure of law as
provided under Criminal Procedure
Code 1898”.

9. No doubt, the High Court has got
the jurisdiction to quash F.I-.R under Article
199 of the Constitution but that is to be
exercised in extraordinary circumstances and
with utmost care and caution, such as when no
offence is made out on the face of the record
and does not require appraisal of evidence or
other circumstances of similar nature.
Similarly, this Court cannot investigate the
disputed questions of facts while exercising
constitutional jurisdiction. Reliance is placed
on “Dr. Sher Afgan Khan Niazi V/s. Ali S.
Habib _and_others” (2011 SCMR_ 1813)

wherein it is held that:-

“It is incumbent upon party seeking
constitutional remedy to show that
such party had a clear legal right and
that such right is so clear as not to
admit of a reasonable doubt or
controversy. High Court will not go
into disputed question of fact in
constitutional jurisdiction. This is more
so when it is supported by attending
circumstances and relevant record.
Constitutional jurisdiction of High
Court cannot converted into that of an
Appellate Court. Disputed question of
fact cannot be entertained or allowed
to be re-agitated in writ jurisdiction,
when the relevant law provides other
forums for the purpose. It follows that
finding of fact recorded by Appellate
Court below on appraisal of evidence
cannot be disturbed in writ
jurisdiction. In Constitutional
jurisdiction, Court does not go into a
question involving minute details nor
can it decide facts of which no
foundation is laid, unless it is shown
that such controversy is devoid of
supporting record or perverse”.

The august Supreme Court in

another case titled “Brig. (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmad
V/s. Government through Secretary, Interior
Division, Islamabad _and_2 others” (1994
SCMR_ 2145) while laying down certain
principles with regard to the effect of

investigation and fairness held that:-

“14, The starting point of the
examination of the legal questions
canvassed by the petitioner's counsel
must be the important fact that the
stage at which the petitioner thought it
proper to invoke the High Court's
jurisdiction under Article 199 of the
Constitution was the stage of
registration of criminal cases against
him. The effect of the registration of a

case is to set in train an investigation
by the police in. accordance with law .
As was said in "Norwest Holst Ltd. v.
Department of Trade and others (1978)
3 All ER 280 at 290):

"In every investigation ----there are ---
by and large three different phases.
First of all, the administrative phase;
next, the, judicial phase; and, finally,
the executive phase when the orders of
the Court or the Tribunal are, if
necessary, executed or promulgated.
Quite plainly fairness to the suspect
demands that he should be given a
chance of stating his case before the
final period: the execution Equally
fairness demands that the suspect shall
be given a chance of putting his side of
the case before the judicial inquiry is
over. But on the other side, and the
other side are entitled to fairness just
as the suspect is, fairness to the
inquirer demands that during the
administrative period he should be able
to investigate without having at every
stage to inquire from the suspect what
his side of the matter may be. Of
course it may be difficult to find out
the particular point at which the
administrative phase ends and the
judicial phase begins ....

To quote a passage from Lord Reid's
speech in "Wiseman.v. Borneman"
(1971) AC 297., at 308):--

"Every public officer who has to decide
whether to prosecute or _ raise
proceedings ought first to decide
whether there is a prima facie case, but
no one supposes that justice requires
that should first seek the comments of
the accused of the defendant on the
material before him. So there is
nothing inherently unjust in reaching
such a decision in the absence of the
other party."

10. In addition to above discussion,
the petitioner has got alternative remedy under
the law firstly; he can approach the hierarchy
of concerned police/levy department for
holding a fair investigation and secondly; after
commencement of trial he can invoke the
jurisdiction of the Court under Sections 249-A

or 265-K, Cr.P.C as the case may be.

ii. In view of the above discussion,
we find no merits in this Constitutional
petition and the same is dismissed, however,
we direct the Investigating Agency to
complete the investigation at the earliest with
impartiality. C.M No. 112-M/2016 is also

dismissed being infructuous.
