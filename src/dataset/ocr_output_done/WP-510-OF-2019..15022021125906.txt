FR III IIIA III RIKI RIK.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This constitutional petition seeks
annulment of order dated 21.01.2019 of the learned Judicial
Magistrate-lll, Balakot, whereby on the police report crime
No.167 dated 10.09.2018 under sections 380/109/34 of
police station, Kaghan District Mansehra registered against
the respondents No.4 to 6 was cancelled.

2. The fact of the case, in brief, are that on
10.09.2018 crime No.167 was recorded on the report of the
petitioner / complainant Sardar Attique ur Rehman at police
station, Kaghan District Mansehra against the respondents
No.4 to 6 for committing theft of six LED’s and cash amount

of Rs.90,000/-. Thereafter the respondents No.4 was arrested
ePie

by the local police 18.09.2018, while the respondents No.5 &
6 were granted pre-arrest bail by the learned Additional
District Judge, Balakot, vide order dated 23.10.2018. On
21.01.2019 the local police submitted report before the
learned Judicial Magistrate for cancellation of FIR, which was
allowed, hence, this petition.

3. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record with their valuable

assistance.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioner / complainant
has raised two-fold objections before us, firstly that while
canceling the case the learned Magistrate simply agreed with
the opinion of the police and failed to record his own reasons,
and secondly that before passing the impugned order the
petitioner / complainant was not given the right of audience.

5, It appears from the record that a criminal case had
been registered against the respondents No. 4 to 6. During
investigation, the investigating officer of the instant case on
27.09.2018, issued a notice to the complainant / petitioner to
provide him the record of the visitors of the hotel within three
days from the date of receipt of notice, enabling him to make
progress in the case. This notice was not served upon the
petitioner, whereafter, the police statedly made a report under
section 173 Cr.P.C to the Magistrate that there was no

sufficient evidence against the accused as a result of the
-3-

investigation, and requested to cancel the case / crime report.
The learned Magistrate while agreeing with the report of the
police cancelled the case / crime report vide order dated
21.01.2019.

6. On the legal plane, we are clear in our mind that
the power conferred on the Magistrate under section 173(3)
Cr.P.C is not an arbitrary power and must proceed on
relevant principles akin to those enunciated by the Supreme
Court of Pakistan in Mir Hassan Vs Tariq Saeed and 02
others PLD 1977 SC 451 and Shibli Vs The State PLD
1981 SC 617. If these criteria are taken into consideration in
the facts of the present case, it is observed that the learned
Judicial Magistrate simply agreed with the opinion of the
police officer and failed to record his own reasons for
agreeing with the police. We, therefore, emphasize that while
exercising power under section 173 (3) Cr.P.C, the learned
Magistrate are not to act as pawns in the hands of the police
and pass mechanical orders without application of their
conscious mind to the facts and material placed before them
because the opinion expressed by the police is not binding
upon them. In this context reference may be made to the
case reported as Abdul Ghaffar and 02 others Vs Ishtiaq
Ahmad Judicial Magistrate-l, Tank and 02 others (2012
P.Cr.L.J 1451). The learned Magistrate must be made to

realize that the power to cancel a police case is of wide
ad 2

amplitude which has the effect of bringing a halt the criminal
prosecution which otherwise would entail a detailed process.
Such a power, therefore, by its very nature, cannot be
designed to be exercised on mere ipse dixit of the police
otherwise, the very purpose for conferring this power on the
Magistrate on responsible level in supervisory capacity would
stand defeated. In the case reported as Bahader and
another Vs The State and another (PLD 1985 S.C 62), it
was held that a Magistrate cancelling a registered criminal
case is required to act judicially in that he has to act fairly,
justly and honestly. The party is left free to institute a
complaint on the same fact and the Magistrate does not even
after passing such an order renders himself functus officio.
This view was followed in Arif Ali Knan’s case (1993 SCMR
187) and Muhammad Sharif and 08 others Vs The State
and another (1997 SCMR 304) which was also referred in
the case reference Hussain Ahmad Vs Mst. Irshad Bibi
and others (1997 SCMR 1503). On competently instituted
proceedings, where it appears clear to the courts that those
has been an attempt at stifling the prosecution in its infancy in
the absence of conscious application of mind or on
consideration other than public policy, preventing abuse of
process of law, and to secure the ends of justice or if it for
ulterior purposes, they would not hesitate to interfere in fit

cases an compel observance of law. In either cases affecting
-5-

criminal prosecution, whether administrative or judicial in

character, must flow for full application of mind of the learned

Magistrate to the facts of a given case and the decision must

be based on considering of purpose of law advancing the

interest of justice.

7. Now turning to the second objection of the learned

counsel for the petitioner. It is observed that one of the basic

concept of Sharia in the administration of justice (adl) is the

hearing of both the parties by the Qazi or Judge passing the

order. This is known as the principles of natural justice which

includes the principles:-

(i) That aman cannot be a Judge of his own cause.

(ii) That no party is to be condemned unheard.

(iii) That the party must in good time know the precise case
he is to meet; and

(iv) That a party is entitled to know why a matter has been
decided against him.

8. If, in any action, any one of the principles

enumerated above are not followed that action must be

struck down. The principle of ‘audi alterm parterm’ i.e. a

person cannot be condemned unheard is a time honoured

principle. Therefore, where an order to the prejudice of a

party is made without hearing him, for instance a privilege

granted to a person, is withdrawn without giving a show
-6-

cause notice, the order being bad in law, is to be ignored and
laid to rest.

9. Principles of natural justice are well recognized by
Holy Quran. For instance, on refusal of Satan (Iblis) to bow
down to Adam on the command of Almighty ALLAH, he was
punished for his rebellious arrogance and jealous
disobedience only after he was asked to explain his conduct.
The Holy Quran has also laid down the procedure which
ALLAH has ordained to be adopted on the day of judgment
to requite the virtuous and to punish the recalcitrant. It is
provided that full accounting of one’s virtue or vices will be
carried on. Since ALLAH has made it a rule to get every
action of a person recorded in his record of actions
(Amalnama) a copy of his record shall be given to everyone
in his right hand if his virtues override or weigh more than his
vices and in his left hand or from his back side, if otherwise.
In the way a show cause notice is given, he will be confronted
with the wrongs and sins committed by him in his stay in this
world, then evidence of his hands or other parts of the body
as well as other evidence shall be taken before sentencing
him to hell. Two of the qualities of ALLAH are that he is all
knowing and aware of everything. He has full knowledge of
the virtues and misconduct of every human being. He is also
Just. He can, therefore, requite a person for his good deeds

or send him to hell for his wrong doings on the basis of his
-7-

own knowledge. But obviously he has laid down such a
consummate procedure in order to satisfy the principle that
no one would be condemned unheard and justice should not
only be done, but should be manifestly done to the
satisfaction of all including who is later condemned.

10. ALLAH did not destroy any people / nation except
after forewarning through His Prophet. Hazrat Nooh
(P.B.U.H) administered warning to his nation in clear
language (7.59, 11, 25). | fear for you the chastisement of the
grievous day. He warned them till they themselves asked for
punishment (11.32) “O. Nooh! Thou hast disputed with us
and multiplied disputation with us; now bring upon us that
wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou art of the truth ones.”
11. Hazrat Hudd was sent as an apostie on Aad.
Hazrat Saleh was sent to Thamood, Hazrat Lut was also sent
as an apostie of ALLAH. Hazrat Shoaib was sent to the
people of Madyan. Each of them warned his nation of
chastisement, but retribution was sent to destroy them, when
they asked for it. This is the story of warnings going
unheeded and of mocking and challenging invocations being
made for award of retribution.

12. The people of pharagh received several warnings
in the form of draught, dimination of fruits, blood, locusts,
vermits, frogs and blood but, they were arrogant and when

the terror fell on them they cried; O Moses! Pray for us unto
-8-

the lord, because He hath a covenant with them. If you
removest the terror from us we verily will trust and will let the
children of Isreal go with there (7:134) but each time they
broke their promise and were ultimately drowned.

13; These cases furnish best examples of the same
two principles discussed in the preceding paras.

14. It is by now settled that in all proceedings by
whatsoever held, whether judicial or administrative, the
principles of natural justice have to be observed if the
proceedings might result in consequences affecting “the
person or property or other right of the parties concerned” this
rule applies even though there may be no positive words in
the statute or legal document whereby the power is vested to
take such proceedings, for, in such cases this requirement is
to be implied into it as the minimum requirement of fairness.
In this behalf reference may be made to the cases reported
as Chief Commissioner Karachi Vs Mrs. Dina Sohrab
Katrak (PLD 1959 SC (Peshawar) 45), Faridoon Limited
Vs Government of Pakistan (PLD 1961 SC 537) and Abdur
Rehman Vs_ Collector and Deputy Commissioner
Bahawalnagar and others (PLD 1964 SC 461).

15. The result is that this writ petition is admitted and
allowed and the impugned order dated 21.01.2019 of the
learned Judicial Magistrate-lll, Balakot is laid to eternal place

and case is remanded back to him to pass a speaking order
-9-

either way by recording his own reasons on the report of the
police, but, after providing an opportunity of hearing to the
petitioner / complainant. The Additional Registrar of this court
is directed to send the copy of this judgment to the learned
Sessions Judges of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for

onward circulation to the judges.
