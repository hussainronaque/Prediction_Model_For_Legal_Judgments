Syed Masood Hussain Shah and others
Vs
National Accountability Bureau (NAB), through its
Chairman and others

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 03.07.2024

Petitioners (by): M/S. Shumail Ahmad Butt and Barrister
Qasim Wadoud Advocates

Respondents (by): M/S Syed Azeem Dad, DPG_ and
Muhammad Ali, ADPG.

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J.- This consolidated judgment
shall dispose of the instant as well as the connected W.P
No.2710-P/2024 having involved a common question of
law for adjudication beside having common facts.

2. In the instant petition, Syed Masood Hussain Shah,
who is the Chief Executive of M/s Maqbool Associates
(Pvt) Ltd. and others the Petitioners have challenged the
orders of. the worthy Director General, National
Accountability Bureau (“NAB”) dated 13.03.2024,
freezing the assets of the Petitioners followed by the
order of the learned Judge Accountability Court-HI,
Peshawar (“Court”) dated 28.03.2024 confirming the
said freezing order and the subsequent order of the Court
dated 18.04.2024 and 26.04.2024.

3. The present issue stems from the

inquiry/investigation being conducted by the NAB in
respect of alleged corrupt and corrupt practices in the
execution of a project commonly known as Buss Rapid
Transit (“BRT”). It is the case of prosecution /
investigation that an agreement was executed between
the Peshawar Development Authority (“PDA”) and
Messers SGEC-Magbool-Calson JV on 14.11.2017,
which is a Joint Venture of Pakistani as well as Chinese
companies for procurement of a civil works of the BRT.
During inquiry conducted by the respondents, it was
revealed that a contract for execution of the BRT project
was secured through corrupt practices and the cost of the
project was illegally increased from Rs. 49.346 billion to
Rs. 66.437 billion due to mismanagement and frequent
changes of the designs, malpractices of the contract
management by the government officials in league with
Petitioners; illegal benefits were extended to the
Petitioners in award of contracts which prevented the
BRT project from completion within stipulated time and
resultantly caused huge loss to the government
exchequer. Regarding the role of Syed Masood Hussain
Shah, the Chief Executive of M/s Maqbool Associates
(Pvt) Ltd, it is the assertion of the prosecution that he
signed Supplementary JV Agreement with M/s Calsons,
M//s SGEC and M/s China Railway 21‘t Bureau Group,
whereby it was agreed to pay 2% of the total project cost
as management fee to the Chinese lead partners and it
was agreed that 100% construction work shall be
executed by M/s Magqsool and M/s Calson while the
respective lead Chinese M/s CR21G & SGEC firm shall
be silent partner. He had submitted fake documents in
respect of his company’s financial position and got
benefit in securing the contract for execution of BRT
Project. Similar allegations were also attributed to other
individual namely Imran Latif and Amir Latif, who are
the Director/owners of M/S Calson. The inquiry in the
case has been initiated since long which was later
converted into investigation, However, how long it will
take to conclude the investigation has not been provided
to us.

4. Through the instant petition, the following orders
have been challenged:

@ Order dated 13.03.2024. Through the said
order, the worthy Director General NAB
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while exercising his
power under section 12 of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999
(“Ordinance”) has ordered for freezing of 75
Bank Accounts maintained by the Petitioners at
different banks and at different places i.e.
Islamabad, Karachi, Toba Tek Singh etc. It is
the opinion of the worthy Director General
NAB in Para-2 of the said order that after
perusing the record collected during
inquiry/investigation, he finds that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the accused
have committed the offence of corruption and
corrupt practices and resultantly caused loss to
the exchequer being an offence under section

9(a) of the Ordinance and schedule thereto.
5.

(ii)

(iii)

Order dated_28,03.2024. An application was
filed by the NAB through special prosecutor for
confirmation of the freezing order dated
13.03.2024 to the Court; notice was issued to
the Petitioners and after hearing the parties, the
Court has ordered for the confirmation of the
freezing order, vide order dated 28.03.2024.

Order_dated_ 18.04.2024. On the objection
petition filed by the Petitioners, an order was
passed by the Court on 18.04.2024. The learned
Court has slightly modified the order dated
28.03.2024 confirming the freezing order by
allowing the Petitioners to operate the account
in the manner that the Director General NAB
should be applied through the Court and
accordingly the Director General NAB shall
submit the requisite amount to the court for
further disbursement to the Petitioners who
would be required to submit acquaintance roll
to the Court. Similarly, the operation of the car

leasing account was also allowed.

In W.P No.2710-P/2024, the allegations against

the Petitioner are that the Petitioner while in Joint

Venture with the Chinese firms namely M/s Beijing

Santel Technology & Trading Corp and M/s Beijing E-

Hualu Information Technology Company Limited,

illegally obtained the contract for Intelligent Transport

System (ITS) of BRT Project. The accused did not
submit their bid till the closing dated ie. 16.07.2018

which was extended up to 31.07.2018 in favour of the
accused and thereafter opportunities given to the accused

to form Joint Venture on 27.07.2018. The bid was

conducted on single source. In the preset case, the

following orders have been challenged before this Court.

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Order _dated_ 04.04.2024. Through the said
order, the worthy Director General NAB KP
has ordered for freezing of two bank accounts
of the Petitioner at Habib Bank Limited,
Corporate Brach Islamabad and Post Mall
Branch, F-7 Islamabad. It is the opinion of the
worthy Director General NAB that after
perusing the record collected during
inquiry/investigation, he finds that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that the accused
has committed the offence of corruption and
corrupt practices.

Order dated 18.04.2024. Through this order,
the freezing order dated 04.04.2024 was
confirmed by the learned Court vide order
dated 18.04.2024 on the application of the
Bureau.

Order _dated_ 15.05.2024. On the objection
petition filed by the Petitioner, it was ordered
by the Court that the matter requires recording

of pro and contra evidence.

6. The learned counsel representing the respondents-

NAB have raised a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of this petition on two grounds; firstly,

that an alternative remedy is available to both the
Petitioners under section 13 of the Ordinance and the said
remedy in form of filing of objection petition has already
been availed by the Petitioners and under section 13(3) of
the Ordinance, an appeal can be preferred once the
objection petition is dismissed. Therefore, keeping in
view the said alternative remedy, this petition is not
maintainable, and secondly, this petition is premature as
the objection petition filed by both the Petitioners shall
be decided on merit by the Court.

7. While rebutting the said arguments of the learned
counsel for the respondents-NAB, the learned counsel (s)
for the Petitioners have argued that since fundamental
rights of the Petitioners to do business guaranteed under
Article 18 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 (“Constitution”) has been seriously
eroded by freezing their accounts, beside the impugned
orders are patently illegal therefore, the said remedy
under section 13 (3) of the Ordinance being illusory
cannot be termed as an effective and efficacious remedy,
hence the jurisdiction of this Court is not barred.

On merit, the learned counsel for the Petitioners,
while referring to the definition of assets as provided
under section 5(c) of the Ordinance and the classes of
offences as provided under sections 9, 10 and 12 of the
Ordinance, have argued that the learned Court was first
required to have decided its jurisdictional fact as the
essential attributes provided for a freezing of a property
in terms of section 12 of the Ordinance are not available
in the present case, therefore, the said order is patently

illegal. In support of their contentions, the learned
counsel for the Petitioners have placed reliance on cases

of “Dr. Muhammad Azam Kasi vs. The State through
Deputy Prosecutor-General Accountability Court No.1,
NAB, Quetta” (2012 PCr.LJ 1950), “Shah Rukh Jamal
vs. National Accountability Bureau, Islamabad_and
others” (PLD 2022 Islamabad 1), “Dr. Arsalan Iftikhar

vs. Malik Riaz Hussain and others” (PLD 2012 SC
903), “Mst. Rukhsana Bangash vs. Chairman, National

Accountability Bureau _(NAB) and 4 others” (2021

PCr.LJ 1813), “Messrs Memom Motors Private Limited
through Genral Manager vs. National Accountability
Bureau through Chairman and 2 others” (2014 PCr.LJ
1378), “Ehsan Ullah Sirazai_and another vs. Director
General (Karachi) National Accountability Bureau and
another” (PLD2018 Sindh 696), “Haji Muhammad Arif

Khattak_and 2 others vs, Chairman/Director General,

National Accountability Bureau_and_another” (PLD

2018 Peshawar_207), “Adam Amin Chaudhry and
another_vs. National Accountability Bureau_(NAB)
Islamabad through Chairman and_29 others” (2023
PCr.LJ 1536)

8. Mr. Azeem Dad, DPG and Muhammad Ali, ADPG
for NAB, while rebutting the said arguments of the
learned counsel for the Petitioners, have argued that the
impugned orders have been passed strictly in accordance
with law and the Petitioners have an ample opportunity to
defend their case before learned Accountability Court as
the objection petitions filed by the Petitioners are yet to
be decided by the learned Accountability Court,

therefore, the petitions merit dismissal.
9. Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused.

10. The perusal of the record would show that the
NAB has initiated inquiry in the alleged corrupt and
corrupt practices in obtaining execution of contract of
BRT Project which was later converted into
investigation. However, what is the stage of the said
investigation is not before us. The essential question
before this Court is the jurisdictional factor while
invoking section 12 of the Ordinance in the matter i.e.
whether the worthy Director General NAB while passing
the impugned orders has acted in accordance with law
and both the orders freezing the assets/property/Bank
accounts of the Petitioner qualify the essential attributes;
as provided under section 12 of the Ordinance, and
secondly, the learned Court while confirming the said
order has acted judicially or has passed the said order
mechanically without apply his judicial mind. Since the
matter relates to interpretation of sections 12 and 13 of
the Ordinance, therefore, for ease of reference the
relevant provisions along with the other provisions of the
Ordinance germane to the controversy are reproduced as
under:

Section 5(c) of the Ordinance

"Assets" means any property owned, controlled by
or belonging to ay accused, whether directly or
indirectly, or held benami in the name of his spouse
or relatives or associates, whether within or outside
Pakistan which he cannot reasonably account for or
for which he cannot prove payment of full and
lawful consideration.

Section 5(1) of the Ordinance

“Freezing includes attachment, sealing, prohibiting,
holding, controlling or managing any property
either through a Receiver or otherwise as may be
directed by the Court or Chairman NAB, and in
case it is deemed necessary the disposal thereof, by
sale through auction or negotiation subject to
confirmation by the Court or by Chairman NAB as
the case may be after public notice.

Section 12 of the Ordinance
12. Power to freeze property:

(a) The Chairman NAB or the Court trying [an
accused] for any offence as specified under this
Ordinance, may, at any time, if there appear
reasonable grounds for believing that the accused
has committed such an offence, order the freezing
of his property, or part thereof, whether in his
possession or in the possession of any relative,

associate or person on his behalf.

(b) If the property ordered to be frozen under
sub-section (a) is a debt or other movable property,
the freezing may be made:

(i) by seizure; or
ii) by appointment of receiver; or

(iii) by prohibiting the delivery of such
property to the accused or to anyone on his
behalf, or

(iv) by all or any of such or other methods as
the Court or the Chairman NAB as the
case may be, deem fit.

(c) If the property ordered to be frozen is
immovable, the freezing shall, in the case of land
paying revenue, be made through the Collector of
the District in which the land is situated, and in all
other cases--

(i) _ by taking possession; or
Gi) by appointment of receiver; or

(iii) by prohibiting the payment of rent or
delivery of property to the accused or to
any other person on his behalf, or

(iv) by all or any of such methods as the
Chairman NAB or the Court may deem
fit:

Provided that any order of seizure,
freezing, attachment _or_any prohibitory order
mentioned above by the Chairman NAB, shall
remain in force for a period not exceeding fifteen
days unless confirmed by the Court, where the
10

Reference under this Ordinance shall be sent by
the Chairman NAB:

Provided further that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, that the
order of Chairman NAB or the Court shall be
effective from the time of passing thereof or
proclamation thereof in a newspaper, widely
circulated and dispatch at the last known address of
the accused either by registered post A.D. or courier
service or electronic media as the Court may deem
proper having regard to the facts and circumstances
of the case.

(d) If the property ordered to be frozen consists
of livestock or is of a perishable nature, the
Chairman NAB, or the Court may, if it deems
proper and expedient, order the immediate sale
thereof and the proceeds of the sale may be
deposited with the Chairman NAB or the Court, or
as either may direct as appropriate.

(e) The powers, duties, and liabilities of a
receiver, if any, appointed under this section shall
be the same as those of a receiver appointed under
Order-XL of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(Act V of 1908).

(f) The order of freezing mentioned in sub-
sections (a) to (e) shall remain operative until the
final disposal of the case by the Court, and in the
event of the acquittal [or release] of the accused,
shall continue to remain operative for a period of
ten days after receipt of certified copy of the order
of acquittal or release by NAB, where after it shall
be subject to an order by the court in which an
appeal, if any, is filed.

Section 13 of the Ordinance
13. Claim or objection against freezing:

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of ay law for
the time being in force, the Court shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate
upon all claims or objections against the freezing of
any property under section 12 above. Such claims
or objections shall be made before the Court within
14 days from the date of the order freezing such
property.

(b) The Court may for sufficient cause extend
the time for filing such claims or objections for a
period not exceeding additional 14 days.

(c) The accused or any other aggrieved party,
whose claim or objection against freezing of
property has been dismissed by the Court, may,
within ten days file an appeal against such order
before the High Court.

11. The Ordinance contains comprehensive provisions;
defining the offences of corruption and corrupt practices;
its investigation by setting up a Bureau known as
National Accountability Bureau and the procedure for a
trial of the offences. However, where no express
provision is provided for the trial of an offence or
inquiry/investigation, then the provisions of the Criminal
Procedure Code shall mutatis mutandis apply to any
proceedings under the Ordinance.!

12. Section 12 of the Ordinance authorizes the
freezing of the assets/property of the accused facing trial
or investigation, by the Chairman NAB before the final
verdict of guilt by the Court. The jurisprudence on
interpretation of criminal law; so far developed in our
jurisdiction in unequivocal words lays down that the
accused must always be presumed to be innocent and the
onus of proving everything essential to the establishment
of the offence is on prosecution. All that may be
necessary for the accused is to offer some explanations of
the prosecution evidence and if the same appears to be
reasonable even though not beyond doubt and to be
consistent with the innocence of the accused, he should
be given the benefit of it.” It is axiomatic that accused is
considered to be innocent unless proven guilty on
conclusion of the trial and it is well settled rule that a

penal statue must be construed with such strictness as to

1 Section 17 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999
2 Pir Mazharul Haq vs. The State through Chief Ehtesab Commissioner,
Islamabad" (PLD 2005 SC 63)
12

carefully guard the rights of accused and at the same time
preserve the obvious intention of legislature.’

13. Similarly, it is also well settled that a statute which
transgresses on the rights of a subject whether as regards
his person or property, should be so construed, if
possible, which may preserve such rights.*

14. Regarding the presumption against accused as
provided under section 14(a) of the Ordinance, the Apex
Court, while confronted with the same in the case of
Mansur ul Haque’ has held that notwithstanding special
provisions of shifting of burden of proof, fundamental
principle of law of criminal administration of justice that
basic onus is always on prosecution to establish
commission of offence is not changed. Similarly, an
accused facing any inquiry or criminal investigation has
the right to know the nature of the inquiry, the purpose of
the investigation, and the nature of the offence for which
he or she is charged.

15. Keeping in view the aforesaid canon of criminal
administration of justice, we would now revert to the
present controversy. Section 12 of the Ordinance no
doubt empowers the Chairman or the officer of the NAB
or Court trying an accused for an offence under the
Ordinance to order the freezing of his property or part
thereof. However, this power is statutory in nature and
not discretionary and can be exercised only if there

appear reasonable grounds for believing that the accused

3 Crawford, "Statutory Construction" Page 474, Understanding Statute, Page
258).

4 The State vs. Syed Qaim Ali Shah" 1992 SCMR 2192)

5 Mansur ul Haque vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2008 SC 166)
has committed any offence under the Ordinance subject
to an inquiry or investigation. Therefore, this statutory
power cannot be exercised mechanically and without the
essential satisfaction of the Chairman NAB as well as the
Court to reach at the conclusion that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that the accused has committed the
offence before passing a stringent order freezing the
assets of the accused. The Islamabad High Court in the
case of Shah Rukh Jamal ®, has very aptly and elaborately
explained the expression "reasonable ground for
believing" after referring to the opinion of the Superior
Court in the case of "Fazlul Qader Choudhury v. Crown"
(PLD 1952 FC 19), "Ch. Abdul Malik v. The State"
(PLD 1968 SC 349, "Chaudhry Shujat Hussain v. The
State" (1995 SCMR 1249, Paras 12, 13 and 14 of the said

judgment are relevant which are reproduced as under.

12. The expressions ‘reasonable grounds for
believing’ and ‘reasonable suspicion’ are distinct.
The august Supreme Court in the case titled
"(Moulvi) Fazlul-Qader Choudhury v. Crown"
(PLD 1952 Federal Court 19) has considered and
interpreted the expression and has observed and
held that it may be that a certain amount of
suspicion is caused by the conduct of a person but
the word "believe" is a much stronger word and,
moreover, it would require that the belief must be a
reasonable one. In the case titled "Ch. Abdul Malik
v. The State" [PLD 1968 SC 349] the august
Supreme Court has explained the expression as
follows:

"Reasonable grounds" is an expression which
connotes that the grounds be such as would appeal
to a reasonable man for connecting the accused with
the crime with which he is charged, "grounds"
being a word of higher import than "suspicion".
However, strong a suspicion may be it would not
take the place of reasonable grounds. Grounds will
have to be tested by reason for their acceptance or

6 Shah Rukh Jamal vs. National Accountability Bureau, Islamabad and others
(PLD 2022 Islamabad 01)
rejection. The reasonableness of the grounds has to
be shown by the prosecution by displaying its cards
to the Court, as it may possess or is expecting to
possess as demonstrating evidence available in the
case both direct and circumstantial."

13. The august Supreme Court in the case titled
"Chaudhry Shujat Husain v. The State" [1995
SCMR 1249] has observed and held as follows:
"The term "reason to believe" can be classified at a
higher padestal than mere suspicion and allegation
but not equivalent to proved evidence. Even the
strongest suspicion cannot transform in "reason to
believe." In Nisar Ahmad's case the criteria laid
down seems to be that where some tangible
evidence is available against the accused which, if
left unrebutted, may lead to the inference of guilt."
14. It is obvious from the above discussed precedent
law that having ‘reasonable grounds to believe' has
reference to the required evidentiary threshold. It is
a legal standard and it has to be met as a
precondition before exercising the intrusive power
under section 12 of the Ordinance of 1999. There
must be ‘reasonable grounds’ which manifests
existence of certain essential facts. It essentially
refers to the existence of such facts and
circumstances which would lead a_ reasonable
prudent person to form a belief. In the context of
section 12 such belief would be relatable to the
property being, directly or indirectly, owned and
controlled by an accused and the latter having
committed one of the offences described under
section 9 of the Ordinance of 1999. The requisite
standard is higher than a reasonable suspicion but
less than 'on balance of probabilities’. It is distinct
from conjecture, speculation or suspicion. The
required standard is far less than proving something
beyond a reasonable doubt. It is a threshold required
for a reasonable person to conclude and be satisfied
on the basis of sufficient material to conclude
deprivation of or interference with the right to own,
hold or control a property. The conclusion may be
subjective but it must be based on some reliable
material or evidence. The formation cannot be
based on mere suspicion even if it may be
reasonable. In a nutshell, forming an opinion On the
basis of reasonable grounds to believe is distinct
and a higher legal standard than ‘reasonable
suspicion’.

16. It is also axiomatic that any statutory authority
dealing with the rights of people whether exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial functions, while passing any

order under any statute, it is required to give reasons for
passing the said order. The said reasons must confirm
that the statutory authority while passing an order has
considered the matter as required by the statute
conferring power to it to pass such order and it is
satisfied that the said circumstances exist which are
prerequisite for passing the said order nevertheless the
said reasons must be reflected from the contents of the
order. Any vague order of a statutory authority, though
authorized under the law to pass the said order would be
nullity in the eye of law.

17. In the case of R v HEFC, ex parte Institute of
Dental Surgery [1994] 1 WLR 242, it is held that "The

giving of reasons may in any one case be requisite. The
giving of reasons may among other things concentrate
the decision-maker's mind on the right questions;
demonstrate to the recipient that this is so; show that the
issues have been conscientiously addressed and how the
result has been reached; or alternatively alert the
recipient to a justifiable flaw in the process. On the other
side of the argument, it may place an undue burden on
decision- makers; demand an appearance of unanimity
where there is diversity; call for the articulation of
sometimes inexpressible value judgments; and offer an
invitation to the captious to comb the reasons for

previously unsuspected grounds of challenge".

18. In our jurisdiction, the said obligation on the
statutory authority is embedded in section 24-A of the
General Clauses Act, 1897, which envisages that where,
by or under any enactment, a power to make any order or
give any direction is conferred on any authority, office or
person such power shall be exercised reasonably, fairly,

justly and for the advancement of purposes of the
enactment. It further envisages that the authority, office
or person making any order or issuing any direction
under the power conferred by or under any enactment
shall, so far as necessary or appropriate give reasons for
making the order.
19. The Apex Court in the case of Muhammad Amin
Muhammad Bashir’ has held that “Section 24-A of the
General Clauses Act, 1897, reiterates the principle that
statutory power is to be exercised "reasonably, fairly,
justly and for the advancement of the purposes of the
enactment" and further clarifies that an executive
authority must give reasons for its decision. Any action
by an executive authority which is violative of these
principles is liable to be struck down. No other view is
permissible".
20. Similarly, Article 23 of the Constitution envisages
that every citizen shall have the right to acquire, hold and
dispose of property in any part of Pakistan, subject to the
Constitution and any reasonable restrictions imposed by
law in the public interest. The right of every citizen to
enter upon any lawful profession or occupation, and to
conduct any lawful trade or business subject to
reasonable restrictions has also be recognized by the
Constitution through Article 18 of the Constitution.
21. The question whether a restriction so imposed by
legislation is reasonable or justiciable, that is to say
amenable or judicial determination. Mr. Justice A. R.
CORNELIUS, the CJ, in the case of Saiyyid Abul A'LA
Maudoodi,’ has observed that the Constitution expressly
gave the Courts power of judicial review of legislation,
7 Muhammad Amin Muhammad Bashir Limited vs. Government of Pakistan
through Secretary Ministry of Finance, Central Secretariat, Islamabad and

others (2015 SCMR 630)
8 PLD 1964 SC 673
and reason in such affairs being peculiarly the province
of the Judiciary, it is surely within judicial review to
examine both as to the reasonableness of the law itself, as
well as the reasonableness of the mode of application, of
the restriction, whether such mode be prescribed by the
statute or not. Therefore, the very word "reasonable"
itself attracts the judicial process of ascertainment of the
quality of consistency with reasons. This excludes
subjective satisfaction and in judging whether a
restriction is reasonable, an objective standard, that is, the
standard of the average prudent man shall have to be
applied.

22. Having discussed the above canon of law let us
examine section 12 of the Ordinance and its application
to the present case. We are mindful of the observation of
the Apex Court in the case of Khan Asfandyar Wali ® that
the provision of section 12 of the Ordinance have been
made consistent with Article 23 of the Constitution.
Indeed, section 12 of the Ordinance is exhaustive and
self-explanatory which provides that the Chairman may,
at any time, if there appear reasonable grounds for
believing that a person has committed an offence,
punishable under the ordinance, order the freezing of his
property or part thereof.

The word occurring “his property” in section 12
of the Ordinance cannot be given wider meaning as to
include any of the property owned by the accused. These
words shall be restricted only to those assets or
properties of he accused which are subject matter of the
investigation; otherwise if wider meaning is given to it

as to include any of the property of the accused then it

8 Khan Asfandyar Wali vs. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2001 SC 607)
will have the effect of enlarging the scope of the

Ordinance to those properties of the accused, the

acquisition whereof is no offence under the Ordinance.

Indeed, it is axiomatic that a penal statute has to be

construed strictly and as held in Qayem Ali Shah case

the construction of such kind of statutes would be to
preserve the citizens’ rights.

23. Keeping in view the jurisprudence developed for

interpretation of criminal law as stated above, and the

fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitutional of
the accused through Article 18 and 23 of the

Constitution, the following are the essential conditions

for invoking section 12 of the Ordinance in a case.

(i) | the power w/s 12 can be exercised by the Chairman
NAB (delegatee) or the court trying an accused
for any offence as specified under this Ordinance;

(ii) there must be reasonable grounds for believing
that the accused has committed an offence under
the Ordinance;

(iii) The reasons of his such belief must be provided in
order;

(iv) The property/assets so frozen by the order under
section 12 ibid must have some nexus with the

alleged crime of the accused being investigated.

24. Having concluded the aforesaid legal discourse, let
us examine the impugned orders passed by the worthy
Director General, NAB, dated 13.03.2024, followed by
the order of the Court, dated 28.03.2024, and the order of
the worthy Director General, NAB dated 04.04.2024,
followed by the order of the Court, dated 18.04.2024, on
the touchstone of the jurisprudence developed in our

country by the Superior Courts. In both the cases, the
19

worthy Director General, NAB, while ordering for the
freezing of the bank accounts of the Petitioners, has
neither provided reasons nor the reasons of his believe
that the accused-Petitioners in any manner are connected
with the crime being investigated by the NAB. It would
be pertinent to note that the comments filed by the
respondents do refer to some alleged irregularities in the
award of the contract to the present Petitioners relating to
the civil work as well as other work. However, no
document is available with such record to meet the test of
expression “reasonable grounds for believing” as
explained by the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court in the
case of Shah Rukh Jamal supra.

25. Similarly, the learned counsel representing the
Petitioners in both the cases have strenuously argued that
various business accounts of the Petitioners have been
ordered to be frozen by the worthy Director General,
NAB without realizing that the said accounts are the
business accounts of the Petitioners, who are carrying the
occupation/business of execution of civil work and are
presently carrying out the works under important
contracts executed with various government agencies
throughout Pakistan. The said accounts of the Petitioners
have no connection with the alleged inquiry/investigation
being conducted by the NAB and if the said accounts
remain frozen then it will have an adverse effect on the
execution of the said contracts as it would hamper the
mode of receiving payment from the employer as well as
payment to the employees and payment towards the other
contractual obligations of the Petitioners. Be that as it
may, the said defense offered by the Petitioner requires

evidence, however, the impugned orders passed the
20

Chairman NAB neither contain any reasons nor has
mentioned in the impugned orders any relevance of the
amount allegedly earned by the Petitioners through
corrupt and corrupt practices with the accounts so frozen.
We are also mindful of the fact that so far the guilt of the
Petitioner has not been established, therefore, the harsh
order of the DG NAB has the effect of depriving both the
Petitioners of carrying on the lawful trade as well as the
right to hold the property in terms of Articles 18 and 23
of the Constitution. Thus we are of the considered
opinion that the orders of the worthy Director General,
NAB are unreasonable, harsh, deficient in its contents
and incorrect in its result. Indeed, it is an offhand
decision by the worthy Director General, NAB,
completely lacks the essential attributes of section 12 of
the Ordinance, therefore, all the impugned orders, as
stated above, passed by the worthy Director General,
NAB, are not sustainable in the eye of law.

26. Moving on to the orders of the Court dated
28.03.2024 and 18.04.2024 in the case of Syed Maqbool
Hussain Shah etc. (W.P No.2662-P/2024) and orders
dated 18.04.2024 and 15.05.2024 in the case of LMK
Resources Pakistan (Private) Limited (W.P No.2710-
P/2024). The object of first proviso to section 12 of the
Ordinance envisaging that the order of freezing passed by
the Chairman/Director General, NAB would be subject to
the confirmation of the Court as it is the duty of the Court
to ensure that the order passed by the Chairman/Director
General, NAB confirms the essential attributes of section
12 of the Ordinance ibid and if it lacks any of such
attributes, the Court is not bound to confirm the said

order. Indeed, the function of the Court, either at the
21

investigation stage of any case or during the trial, is not
to approve the ipse dixit of the investigation officer or,
for that matter, of the prosecution but to each case, the
court is bound to apply its independent judicial mind and
ensure that any request of the prosecution / investigation
that requires indulgence of the Court under any legal
dispensation, whether confirms the statutory requirement
or otherwise and not to rubber stamp any request of the
investigation. We have perused the said orders and are of
the firmed opinion that the learned Court has failed to
apply his independent judicial mind while confirming the
order of freezing in both the cases and has rubber
stamped the same despite the fact that the respondents
have raised very serious objection to the confirmation of
the said orders.

27. Moving on further to the objection raised by the
learned counsel for the respondents to the maintainability
of this petition. Main objection of the respondents was
that section 13 of the Ordinance provides a mechanism
for receiving and adjudication of an objection by any
person aggrieved by the freezing order passed under
section 12 of the Ordinance and such objection petition is
already pending before the Court, therefore, not only this
petition is premature but if the objection petition is
decided against the Petitioners, they have a remedy to file
an appeal before this Court. We have perused section 13
of the Ordinance, which in our opinion is not exhaustive.
Furthermore, the grievances raised in this petition which,
inter alia, include that almost 75 bank accounts of the
Petitioners in case of Syed Maqbool Hussain Shah etc.
(W.P No.2662-P/2024), and two (02) bank accounts of

Petitioners in the case of LMK Resources Pakistan
22

(Private) Limited (W.P No.2710-P/2024) have been
frozen by the NAB / Director General NAB without
realizing that the said accounts relate to the present
business activities of the Petitioners in which not only the
pecuniary interest of the Petitioners are involved but
according to the Petitioner, the said accounts relate to
their business activities regarding execution of public
contracts and huge interest of the government/semi
government organization are also involved.

28. In this view of the matter, in our opinion that said
remedy under section 13 of Ordinance is mere illusory.
Indeed, it is not a settled rule that in all circumstances the
availability of an alternate remedy to an aggrieved person
would be a bar for maintaining a Constitutional Petition.
Thus issue of alternate remedy has been well explained
by the Lahore High Court in the case of Arshad
Mehmood'®. The relevant paras of the judgment are

reproduced as under:

13. It is axiomatic and by now a judicial cliché,
that sub-constitutional legislation cannot curtail or
abridge the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.
Legislature, being the creature of the Constitution
cannot take away the jurisdiction of a constitutional
Court conferred by the Constitution. "Shortly stated,
an ordinary statute or a  sub-constitutional
legislation is incapable of ousting, curtailing or
limiting the constitutional jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court or the High Courts and the words
‘no court’ in an ouster clause in a statute do not,
therefore, include the High Courts or the Supreme
Court so far as their constitutional jurisdiction (e.g.
under Article 199 and Article 184 of the
Constitution) is concerned."!! This well settled
constitutional principle loudly resonates through our
jurisprudence: Khan Asfandyar Wali and others v.
Federation of Pakistan through Cabinet Division,
Islamabad and others (PLD 2001 SC 607), Mrs.
Shahida Zahir Abbasi and 4 others v. President of
Pakistan and others (PLD 1996 SC 632), Malik

10 Arshad Mehmood vs. Commissioner/Delimitation Authority,
Gujranawala and others (PLD 2014 Lahore 221)
23

Muhammed Mukhtar, through Legal Heirs v.
Province of Punjab through Deputy Commissioner
(Collector) Bhawalpur and others (PLD 2005 Lah.
251), Miss Asma Jilani v. The Government of the
Punjaband another (PLD 1972 SC_ 139),
Government of West Pakistan and another v.
Begum Agha Abdul Karim Shorish Kashmiri (PLD
1969 SC 14) and Federation of Pakistan and another
v. Malik Ghulam Mustafa Khar (PLD 1989 SC 26),

14, In a more common law context, it is a
judicial norm, that courts jealously guard their
jurisdiction. They start with a strong presumption
against ouster of jurisdiction and construe the same
strictly, which means "that if such a provision is
reasonably capable of having two meanings, that
meaning ... which preserves the ordinary
jurisdiction of the court"! is preferred. "An ouster
clause, however widely worded and whether it
occurs in a Constitution or in an ordinary statute,
does not save an act or order without jurisdiction
(which expression compendiously describes and
includes acts and orders coram non judice and mala
fide) from scrutiny of the courts because the
purported act or order is no act or order at all."

29. The said judgment was reaffirmed by the Apex
Court in the case of Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd!'.
Even otherwise, where in any matter where resolution of
some question of law was required to be made then direct
approach to the High Court is otherwise permissible and
the party cannot be compelled to avail of other remedies,
for under the Constitution, as interpretation of law was

the responsibility of the superior court!”

Therefore, the objection of the respondents to the
maintainability of this petition is overruled.
30. In view of what has been stated above, we hold

and declare:

u Adamjee Insurance Company Ltd vs. Muhammad Ramzan and others
(PLD 2020 SC 414)

v United Business Lines, S.I.E. Gujranwala and another vs. Government of
Punjab through Secretary, Local Government, Lahore and 5 others (PLD
1997 Lahore 456) and Messrs Chenab Cement Product (PVT.) Ltd. and
others vs. Banking Tribunal, Lahore and others PLD 1996 Lahore 672)
