SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through this judgment, we shall
dispose of Cr.A.No.14-D/2022, preferred by the
appellant against his conviction and the connected
CrR.No.01-D/2022, filed by the complainant for
enhancement of the awarded sentence, as both have
arisen out of one and the same judgment dated
31.01.2022, rendered by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II/Judge Mode] Criminal Trial Court, D.I.Khan,
whereby the appellant charged in case FIR No.731 dated
05.8.2018, under Sections 302/324 PPC, police station
Cantt: D.L.Khan, has been convicted under Section
302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life with
fine of Rs.8,00,000/- to be paid to the legal heirs of
deceased Muhammad Kashif, in terms of Section 544-A,

Cr.P.C. or in default thereof to further suffer six months
a

simple imprisonment. He has been further convicted
under Section 324 PPC and sentenced to undergo one
year rigorous imprisonment and to pay a fine of
Rs.100,000/- each or in default thereof, to further
undergo two months simple imprisonment. Both the
sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Benefit of
Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. has been extended to the
convict/appellant,

oo The resume of facts of the prosecution
case as divulged from the FIR, registered on the basis of
murasila Ex.PA, in brief, are that on 05.8.2018 at 7:35
hours, complainant Muhammad Javed (PW-3), while
present with the dead body of his son Muhammad
Kashif, reported the matter at Emergency Room of Civil
Hospital, D.I.Khan, to the effect that on the eventful day
he alongwith his afore-named son and nephew
Muhammad Hasnain (P W-3) were proceeding from their
house on their respective motorcycles for earning
livelihood; that he was ahead of them, whereas his son
and nephew were following him on their motorbike, at
about 6:50 hours when they reached on the spot, he
heard voice of firing from backside, upon which he
stopped and noticed the accused firing at his son and
nephew with the intention to do them away, as a result
whereof, his son got severely injured, fell to the ground

and succumbed to his injuries, whercas his nephew

-3-

fortunately escaped unhurt. After commission of the

offence, the accused decamped from the spot. Besides

the complainant, the occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by his afore-named nephew. Motive for the
offence was stated to be compelling his son by the
accused for friendship, who was forbidden by them upon
which he was annoyed.

3. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the trial Court
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution
produced and examined as many as twelve witnesses,
while Salahuddin Additional Moharrir was examined as
CW-1, who produced daily diaries as Ex. CW 1/1 to Ex.
CW 1/5 whereafter, statement of the accused under
Section 342, Cr.P.C. was recorded wherein he professed
innocence and false implication, however, neither he
wished to be examined on oath in terms of Section
340(2), Cr.P.C. nor produced defence evidence. The
learned trial Court after hearing both the sides, vide
judgment impugned herein, convicted the appellant and
sentenced him, as mentioned above, which has been
questioned by the appellant through the instant criminal
appeal, whereas the complainant has filed the connected
criminal revision for enhancement of sentence,
therefore, both the matters are being disposed of through

this single judgment.

4, Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties heard which would be dealt with at appropriate
stages, Record minutely perused.
5. In order to assess, as to whether the
approach of the learned trial Court is based on proper
appreciation of evidence and that the learned trial Court
applied its judicial mind to the facts and circumstances
of the case, we deem it appropriate to re-assess the
available evidence, so as to avoid miscarriage of justice.
No doubt, the appellant is singularly charged for murder
of the deceased, but that alone is not sufficient to
absolve the prosecution to prove its case on the basis of
available evidence. No doubt, the substitution of single
accused in a murder charge is a rare phenomenon, but at
the same time the apex Court has also laid down the law
through various dictum that to put the rope around the
neck of an accused charged singularly, there must be
ocular account of unimpeachable character, trustworthy
and confidence inspiring, corroborated by circumstantial
evidence.

In case tilled, "Arshad Beg Vs. The
State" (2017 SCMR 1727), it was held that:-

“Eyen otherwise this is a case of single
accused and substitution in such like
cases is a rare phenomenon as normally
kith and kin of the deceased (in this case
real brothers) would not implicate an
innocent person by letting off the real
culprits”.

6. It is the case of prosccution that on the day
of incident complainant (PW-3), his deceased son and
his nephew (P'W-4) were proceeding from their house on
their respective motorcycles for carning livelihood, the
complainant was ahead of them, whereas his son and
nephew were following him on their motorbike, at about
6:50 hours when they reached on the spot, he heard
voice of firing from backside, upon which he stopped
and noticed the accused firing at his son and nephew
with the intention to do them away, as a result whereof,
his son got severely injured, fell to the ground and
succumbed to his injurics, whercas his nephew
fortunately escaped unhurt. The occurrence in the
present case occurred on 05.8.2018 at about 6:50 hours,
whereas the matter was reported on said date at about
7:35 hours, which indicate that the incident was
reported with a remarkable promptitude, followed by
postmortem examination, excluding possibility of
deliberations and consultations.

Bs In the present case, the ocular account of
the incident has been furnished by the complainant and
his nephew Hasnain, who were examined as PW-3 and
PW-4, respectively. No doubt that the complainant is
step-father, while PW-4 is brother-in-law of the
deceased, however, it is well established principle of law

that testimony of a witness which is trustworthy and

a'G«

confidence inspiring cannot be discarded merely on the

basis of close relationship. Reliance in this regard is

placed upon the case law reported as “Ghulam

Murtaza Vs. The State” (2021 SCMR 149), wherein it

has been held by the Apex Court that:-

Although the deceased-Mst. Saima Bibi
is the daughter-in-law of the eye-
witness Mst. Rukhsana (PW.7) but it
has been settled by this Court that mere
relationship of a witness with the
victim would not discard her/his
evidence if it is otherwise confidence
inspiring and trustworthy. Besides, the
medical evidence also supports the
prosecution version. We have observed
that besides the crime empties, the
weapon of offence i.e. .30 bore pistol
was recovered from the possession of
the appellant. These were sent to the
FSL, for analysis and the report in this
regard is positive which is available on
file as Exh. PW.14/8.

While going through the ocular account,
we find no material contradictions between the two,
which also find support from the medical evidence and
site plan. Despite facing taxing cross examination, both
the witnesses remained consistent in their depositions on
material aspects of the case. Their testimony is further
corroborated by the testimony of shopkeeper, who was
an independent witness. He examined before the trial
Court as PW-5. We find that his natural deposition fully
establishes presence of the eyewitnesses on the spot at
the time of incident. The ocular account is further

supported by Fazal Manan, Emergency Officer, Rescue
en

Ps

1122, who was examined as PW-12. He also testified the
venue of lifting the dead body by mentioning the time as
7:00 A.M., which further strengthens the prosecution

story.

In case titled “Aurangzeb Vs. The State
(2020 SCMR 612), it has been held that:-

“The incident was reported with a
remarkable promptitude, followed
by post mortem examination that
cannot be viewed as delayed, factors
excluding possibility of
deliberations and consultations, in
retrospect suggestive of witnesses’
presence at the stated point of time,
coinciding with the durations
mentioned in the autopsy report.
Though inconsequential for want of

ge forensic verification, nonetheless,
the weapon recovered on
petitioner's disclosure is consistent
with the nature of fatal injury.
Occurrence being a broad daylight
affair before a large gathering, does
not admit hypothesis of substitution.
Appraisal of evidence carried out by
both the Courts below, on our own
independent analysis, is found by us
in accord with the principles of safe
administration of criminal justice
and as such does not call for
interference”.

Learned counsel for the appellant/convict
vehemently submitted that both the eyewitnesses have
improved their testimony while appearing before the
trial Court, however, it cannot be denied that it is well
settled that the FIR is not encyclopedia of all details,

which is meant to set the law in motion with regard to a

cognizable offence. In this view of the matter, the
ee

-8-

testimony of eyewitnesses could not be discarded for

9

giving benefit of doubt to the appellant/convict.
8. In addition to the above, the Investigating
Officer (PW-10), during the spot inspection recovered
blood-stained earth from the place of the deceased and
also collected two empties of .30 bore pistol from the
spot. He also recovered a motorbike relating to the
deceased during the spot inspection. The accused was
arrested by this witness and .30 bore pistol having fit
magazine containing three live rounds of the same bore
was also recovered from personal possession of the
. accused, regarding which the marginal witness namely
So Muhammad Mukhtiar ASI was examined as PW-2.
Although it was vehemently argued that there was no
entry in the daily diary register with regard to arrival and
departure of the Investigating Officer with regard to
above recovery, however, same would not benefit the
accused for the reason that we have already believed the
ocular account furnished by the eyewitnesses in the
present case. In this view of the matter, the positive
report of FSL regarding the empties and pistol further
supports the prosecution case.
9. Motive in the present case was stated to be
compelling the deceased by the accused for friendship,
however no evidence was brought in this respect, which

remained a mystery till this stage of the case and

-9-

probably it reacted towards quantum of sentence,
otherwise, the prosecution fully proved its case for
sustaining conviction of the appellant. Even, during
statement of the accused under section 342, CrP:€y
specific question with regard to motive alleged by the
prosecution was put to the accused, which was denied by
him.

10. For the reasons mentioned above, this
Court has reached to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has succeeded in bringing home charges
against the appellant, through confidence inspiring
evidence and that the witnesses remained consistent on
material aspects of the case, Furthermore, the medical
evidence fully supports the ocular account with no room
for substitution, even otherwise in case of a single
accused substitution is a rare phenomenon. The instant

appeal alongwith revision petition, having no merit and

substance are hereby dismissed. /f
