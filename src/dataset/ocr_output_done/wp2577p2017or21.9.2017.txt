IJAZ_ ANWAR, J.- — Firdous Aziz, the petitioner,

through the instant petition has asked for an appropriate writ
declaring the order of justice of Peace/Additional Sessions’
Judge-VIII, Peshawar, as illegal and also prayed for the|
quashment of FIR No. 677 dated 18.5.2017, under Sections
489-F, PPC, registered at Police Station, Khan Raziq,
Peshawar.

2. The background of the case is that the
respondent No.1 submitted an application before Justice of
Peace for registration of case alleging that he was handed
over with a cheque by the petitioner, which, on

presentation before the concerned Bank, was dishonoured.

The application was accepted, vide order dated 18.5.2017,

consequently, the above referred FIR was lodged. Now,
the petitioner through the instant writ petition has
impugned the order of Ex Officio Justice of Peace and

also sought for quashment of the FIR.

3: Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that

means rea is the essential element for constitution of any of
the offence punishable under the law. He next argued that
for constitution of offence under section 489-F PPC,
issuance of a cheque must be with “dishonest intention”. He
while referring to the agreement deed argued that it was a
business transaction and cannot be made basis for
registration of a criminal case as for cancellation of
agreement deed, a civil suit is pending adjudication between
the parties. He was of the view that in such eventuality, the
learned ex officio Justice of Peace should not have
interfered in the matter by directing the police to register a
case on the frivolous application of the private respondent,

most particularly, in absence of pre-requisite ingredients

|
required for the offence under which, the FIR has been

registered. The learned counsel by concluding his
arguments submitted that since the charge against the
petitioner is not only false and mala fide but frivolous as
well and there is no possibility of his conviction in it,
therefore, the impugned order and the FIR, in the
circumstances of the case, are liable to be quashed. He
placed reliance on the cases titled Naseeb Gl vs. Amir Jan

and _ another (2013 P Cr. L J 175), Sardar Muhammad

Aslam vs SHO (2013 YLR 108) and Iftikhar Akbar vs the
State (2008 MLD 159).

4, We have considered arguments of learned

counsel for the petitioner and perused the available

\S AN

record.

5. The perusal of record reflects that learned
Justice of Peace while exercising his powers under section
22-A Cr.P.C issued direction to the SHO concerned for
registration of the FIR against the petitioner as a
cognizable offence was committed. We have perused the
impugned order of Justice of Peace and found the same to
have been passed in accordance with law keeping in view
the allegations levelled against the petitioner, guiding
towards a cognizable offence. The question of
applicability of Section 489-F PPC in the present case
being controversial requiring recording of evidence,
therefore, this court while exercising constitutional
jurisdiction, cannot entertain it.

6. Under Section 154 Cr.P.C police has
statutory duty to register FIR regarding commission of any
cognizable offence and its purpose is only to set the
criminal law in motion. The provisions of Section 154
Cr.P.C are mandatory in nature. When FIR is registered,
then the local police under section 156 Cr.P.C have the
statutory rights to investigate the case and interference by
Court with duties of police is not permissible under the
law as FIR is not an encyclopedia of all the relevant facts,
therefore, the image presented by the FIR will be clarified
when all the incriminating material is brought on record

during investigation. If the accused is found blameless

4

during investigation, he can be dealt with in accordance
with the provisions of sections 169/ 173 (3) Cr.P.C read
with sections 249-A/265-K Cr.P.C besides pressing into
service the punitive proceedings by sending a complaint
under section 182 PPC against informer/ complainant of
the FIR. Therefore, it would be injustice, if, before the real

facts are collected by the investigating agency, the F.I.R.

alleging the commission of cognizable offences, is nipped
in the bud.

qs Of course, this Court has the powers to quash |
|

FIR but in exceptional circumstances, i.e., where the
allegations made in the FIR, on the fact of it, do not
constitute a cognizable offence, or the allegations made in
the FIR are so illogical on the basis of which no prudent
person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is

sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, or

where there is an express legal bar in any of the provisions

of the Code or the concerned Act, under which a criminal
proceeding is instituted. In a case titled Brig. (Retd.) Imtiaz

Ahmad vs. the Govt of Pakistan (1994 SCMR 2142) the apex
Court observed that:-
“The function of the judiciary and the police are

complementary not overlapping and the combination of |

individual liberty with a due observance of law and order

is only to be obtained by leaving each to exercise its own
function, always of course, subject to the right of the court
to intervene in an appropriate case. Control over the
investigation exercised by the court was prejudicial to the

accused and detrimental to the fairness of the procedure

apart from being without jurisdiction. High court |

be done, for the authority to register and investigate a |
|

criminal case in law vests in the police and not in Court. |

assume the role of investi

Similar view was held in a case reported as 2008 |
SCMR 76). wherein it has been observed that |

“High Court has no jurisdiction whatsoever to take the |

role of the investigating agency and to quash the FIR, |

while exercising constitutional power under Article 199 of

the Constitution or under section 561-A Cr.P.C unless and |

until very exceptional circumstances existed.

8. The arguments of learned counsel for the |

petitioner that civil suit is pending between the parties

|
having no force because mere filing of a civil suit is not bar |

to the registration of criminal case if same is made out from |
facts asserted that a criminal act is committed. In the case of

Ghulam Muhammad ys, Muzamil Khan and four others (PLD
1967 é
SC 317), the apex Court held that civil and criminal |

case sj ’ si i
S can go side by side and there is no bar on the criminal

proceedings in presence of the civil suit
