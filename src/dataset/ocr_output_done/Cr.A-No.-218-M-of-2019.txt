Cr.A. No, 218-M/2019

Date of hearing .......18.12.2019
Appellant: (Abdul Wakeel) by Mr. Akhtar Munir

Khan, Advocate,

Respondents (The State & another) by Mr. Sohail

Sultan, Astt: A.G.
WIQAR AHMAD, J-. Impugned herein is judgment

dated 17.04.2019 passed by learned Additional Sessions
Judge Khwaza Khela Swat in case FIR No. 874 dated
25.11.2017 registered under section 15 A.A at Police
Station Khursheed Khan Shaheed (Khwaza Khela) Swat,
whereby the learned trial Court had though acquitted the
accused but have not ordered return of case property i.e.
SMG rifle bearing No. 84930, to the appellant.

2. It has been narrated in the FIR that
Aman Khan SHO (PW-4) on 25.11.2017 at 11:30 hours,
during investigation of case bearing FIR No. 861 dated
26.08.2017 registered under sections 302, 109 PPC at
police station Matta had conducted a raid at the house of
accused/appellant and recovered SMG rifle bearing No.

84930 along with 2 magazines and 30 live rounds of 7.62

(S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
‘oe

bore from residential room of house of the accused. At
the relevant time, the local police could not find any
license or permit in respect of the recovered rifle,
therefore ‘Murasila’ Ex. PA/1 was drafted against the
accused which culminated into FIR No. 874, Ex. PA
dated 25.11.2017 registered under section 15 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act at police station
Khursheed Khan Shaheed (Khwaza Khela) Swat.

3. Upon completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted before the learned
trial Court. Charge was framed against the accused, to
which he pleaded “not guilty” and claimed trial. The
prosecution examined as many as four (4) witnesses,
whereafter statement of the accused/ appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. The learned trial
Court thereafter acquitted the accused/appellant vide
impugned judgment dated 17.04.2019.The appellant is
mainly aggrieved of the impugned judgment to the
extent that no direction was given by the learned trial
Court in respect of return of the case ae i.e.
SMG rifle bearing No. 84930.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant

contended during the course of his arguments that

Nawab (S.B.} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
custody of the ‘appellant regarding the weapon of
offence was held lawful and justified by the learned
trial Court, and thereby acquitted the
accused/appellant, but the case property was not
ordered to be returned to him, despite such findings.
He further added that when the accused had been
authorized by the officers of the law enforcement
agencies to possess the rifle, he was then entitled to its
return.

5. The learned Astt: A.G. submitted that the
order of dismissal of the rifle is according to law,
which would mean that same has been ordered to be
confiscated to the State.

6. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the appellant, learned Astt: A.G appearing on
behalf of the State and perused the record. |
7. Perusal of record reveals that the appellant
is only aggrieved of the judgment of learned trial Court
where it had ordered that the case property i.e. SMG
rifle recovered from the house of accused/appellant,
should be disposed of according to law. Since a short
point was involved and record of the case was also

available, so the appeal was taken for decision and

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
accordingly learned counsel for the appellant was heard
at full length. The judgment of learned trial Court is
relevant in this respect as most of the contentions of the
appellant have been recorded therein along with the
findings of the Court. In this regard, Para 10, 11 and 13
of the judgment are relevant, which are reproduced
hereunder for ready reference;

10. -It is evident from the prosecution evidence that
the accused was not present at home at the time of
recovery of SMG with magazine and cartridges, It
is too admitted by the PWs that the accused was
holding the same rifle with permission of the
authorities. The accused was authorized by the
army official as well as by the concerned authorities
of Police Station Khurshid Khan Shaheed, Khwaza
Khela to keep the recovered SMG with Magazines
& Cartridges. During investigation, the documents
whereby he was authorized by Major Attaullah of
Pak Army and concerned of the Police Station
Khurshid Khan Shaheed were produced and were
taken into possession. It need not be reiterated that
during the days of insurgency/militancy in this area
the army official as well as the police official
authorized the local people to keep arms for their
protection against aggression. The data of the
authorized persons with data of the arms were duly
entered and maintained by the concerned Police
Station. The accused too, was authorized by the
competent authorities and he had produced the
relevant documents before the investigation officer
which fact is admitted by the prosecution witnesses.
Perusal of the documents would reveal that entries
were duly made in Police Station record and
number of recovered SMG does tally with the
entries in the record of Police Station. Similarly, the
burden was on prosecution to have established that
either the sanction authorizing the accused to keep
arm was illegal or the same order had subsequently
been withdrawn rendering the possession of
authorize arms illegal. Nothing in this respect had
been produced,

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
11, When the accused was holding the recovered
SMG with Magazine and Cartridges with
permission and sanction of the local authorities,
which fact is admitted by the PWs, then its keeping
cannot be deemed to be voilative of the provisions
of section 15 A.A, Provision of Section 15 AA are
not attracted to the peculiar facts of the case, hence
accused facing trial namely Abdul Wakil Khan s/o
Abdul Majid Khan r/o Tehsil Khwaza Khela, is
acquitted of the charges leveled in case FIR No.
874, Dated 25.11.2018, under section 15 AA, Police
Station Khurshid Khan Shaheed, Khwaza Khela,
District Swat.

13. Case property, SMG with 02 magazines and 30
live cartridges of 7.62 bore be kept intact till the:
expiry of period of limitation/Revision and '
thereafter be disposed-off in accordance with law.

The question before this Court is that
whether the authorization given to the appellant by |
members of the law enforcement agency or the local
police can be deemed to be a lawful authorization of the .
rifle, entitling the appellant to its return or not? The law |
in respect of possession, manufacture, transportation |

;
etc, of weapons of various categories have been '
consolidated through the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms
Act, 2013, hereinafter referred as “the Arms Act” (Act. |
No. XXIII of 2013). Preamble of the Act explains that ;

i
whereas it is expedient to regulate, the manufacture, ;
conversion, repair, sale, transportation, bearing or
possession of arms or ammunition in the province of the |

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in the manner as provided in the

Act. Section 8 of the Arms Act provides for the’

'
t

Nawab (S.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad !
'
|
1
\

prohibition of going armed ‘without license and lays‘
down that no person shall go armed with any arms |
except under a license and to the extent and in tne!
manner permitted thereby. Section 9 provides fr|
unlicensed possession of arms. The said section being !
relevant is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“Section 9;

No person shall have in his possession or under his

control any arms or ammunition, except under a

license and in a manner and to the extent permitted
thereby.” :

Chapter-IV deals with licenses wherein

section 11 provides for the power of government to

|
|
|
make rules for determining, the officers by whom and!
the form in which as well as the terms and ont
subject to which, any license shall be granted, or
renewed including the period .of licenses and fee,
payable etc. Section 12 of the Arms Act reserved the |
right of the government to issue the description of the ;
prohibited and non-prohibited bores and the powers to!

issue license for non-prohibited bores has been

exclusively given to the government under sub-section 2 |

of the ibid section. The officers of law enforcement

agencies, on whose authorization the appellant have |

been banking on, have never been so notified by the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
government in the official gazette, under section 1lof

the Arms Act, to be the competent authority for issuance

}

of arms licenses. The matter of arms licenses has been

regulated by the Arms Act, no authorization can |

therefore be thought to be a lawful authorization unless

{

backed by the Arms Act or any other law. The appellant |

could neither point out that the said officers had either
been authorized under the Arms Act or under any oe
law, to issue arms licenses. The permission to the

appellant to possess weapons by such officers, even if
granted would be of no help to the appellant.

8. In the case of “Saced Ahmad v/s The}

State” reported as “1971 SCMR_774”, the Hon’ble

Apex Court had held that a criminal Court was under no ;
i
!

compulsion to order return of the property to the person

from whom it was taken. The relevant observation of!

the august Court is reproduced hereunder for ready |

t
reference;

{
“It has been strenuously contended on behalf of the |
appellant that the criminal case having, ended in
acquittal, the cattle should have been returned to the
person from whom they were taken, viz. the appellant, {
and in support of this contention the decision in P L D
191U S C 343 has been cited before us. The case
under report has clearly laid down that although the
ordinary principle is that when the offence is not .
proved the property is to be returned to the person
Srom whom it has been taken in an exceptional circum i
Stance, however, this principle is not applicable. The |
}

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
case was considered to be of an exceptional
circumstance and the property was not returned to the
person from whom it had been taken. Section $17 of
the Criminal Procedure Code, as is evident from its
language places no compulsion on the part of the
criminal Court to return the property to the person
from whom it is taken. On the contrary it makes it
discretionary on the part of the Court te make such
order as it thinks fit for the disposal of the property by |

an a eee ane ee tee nee

destruction, confiscation or delivery to any person
claiming to be entitled to possession there of or
otherwise.”

In the case of “Rai Bashir Ahmad v/s The
State” reported as “1971 P Cr. LJ 255”, the Hon'ble |
Lahore High Court had drawn a distinction between the

return of other items like vehicles etc on ‘Superdari’,

and handing over of weapons of offence on interim

custody pending trial of a case. In the case of “Mukhtar

en

Ahmad v/s The State” reported as “PLD 1963 WP.) |

Lahore 451”, the Hon’ble Court was pleased to acquit

the accused but had maintained the order of return of ‘

stolen property to the complainant. The Hon’ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “The Director

Intelligence __and Investigation (Custom) FBR,

Islambad_and another v/s Fazal Ghani_and_ others” ;
(“Criminal Petition No. 802 of 2015”) while dealing

with the cases of vehicles brought by the Internally!

tee a nee eet ln te

‘
Displaced Persons of Waziristan to Lakki Marwat and
D.I. Khan and seized by the local police in the subject |
case from some of such IDPs, had held that the
|

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad 3
temporary registration of such vehicles allowed by the

local officers was not sufficient to entitle the |

i}
respondents to return of the vehicles. The relevant
observation of the Hon’ble Court in this respect is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“The question emerging for consideration of this
Court is whether the vehicles seized have been
lawfully imported and the persons importing them
-have paid the duties and taxes leviable thereon. The
answer to the question is a simple no. When this being
the case, the learned Additional Sessions Judge could
not have passed an order for their disposal under
Section 516-A Cr.P.C, nor could the High Court in
the hierarchy affirm such order. In this view of the
matter, we convert Criminal Petition No. 802 of 2015
into appeal, allow it, set aside the impugned judgment
granting the custody of the vehicle to the respondents,
and dismiss Criminal Petition No. 22 of 2016 as being
barred by time.”

A ea teen  e er mre tet

The said judgment was subsequently

followed by this Court in the case of “Bhutto Khan

and 4 others v/s Inspector General of Police KPK,

t

‘

Peshawar_and_4 others” reported as “2018 PTD
1716”, wherein the following observation was

recorded;

11. A bare reading of this section reveals that the
notification regarding exemption of any goods
imported into Pakistan can only be issued by the
Federal Government, There are certain other
provisions of Customs Act, 1969 which empower the
Central Board of Revenue also to issue certain
notifications in matters pertaining to the delegated
legislation, and the exemptions and the scope and
extent thereof under Section 19 of the Customs Act,

retin gen Bee on ae manatees em etme Ae apr le

Nawab (S.B.} Hon'’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad

1969 are exclusively within the competence of Federal
Government.

12, Admittedly, the vehicles in questions were neither
brought into settled area in accordance with the
provisions contained in the Customs Act, 1969 nor the
custom duty nor any duties and taxes leviable thereon
were paid by its importers, hence, neither the High
Court nor Sessions Judges nor Judicial Magistrates
have the power to release such vehicles on superdari.
These vehicles are subject to departmental
adjudication as envisaged under the Customs Act,
1969.

He ee tna ft oe ee

i
9, Since authorization granted by the
authorities concerned was not a lawful authorization

under the law, therefore the rifle cannot be handed

back to the appellant. Same has been ordered by the

learned trial Court to be dealt with in accordance with |
law, which would mean confiscation of the rifle to the |
State. i

10. For what has been discussed above, the!

|
appeal in hand is dismissed. Office shall send copy of!

this judgment to the police station concerned for
necessary action.
