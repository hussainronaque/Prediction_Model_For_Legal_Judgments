OB OK KK

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Charged in case FIR
No.40 dated 28.02.2021, registered under Sections
302/324/34 of Pakistan Penal Code, at police station
Mullazai, District Tank, the accused/petitioner after his
arrest applied for bail before the Court of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, Tank, which was declined
vide order dated 22.4.2021, feeling aggrieved therefrom,
the petitioner approached this Court through the instant
bail petition.

2. The prosecution story as divulged from the
FIR, registered on the basis of murasila, is that on

28.02.2021 at 18:10 hours, complainant Mir Hassan
-2-

Shah, while present with the dead body of his sister
Mst. Nargis Bibi, reported the matter to local police in
the Emergency Room of DHQ Hospital, Tank, to the
effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith his sister,
was on his way back to home after attending marriage
ceremony of their relative Ihsan Ullah, when reached to
the place of incident, it was about 04:35 hours that the
accused/petitioner alongwith his co-accused Ismail and
Noor Zaman, duly armed with firearms, appeared on a
motorbike, driven by the accused/petitioner and on
approaching them, they alighted from the motorcycle
and started firing at them with their respective weapons,
which resulted into the death of his sister whereas he
luckily escaped unhurt. The accused decamped from the
spot after commission of the offence. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence is stated to be witnessed by
co-villagers. Motive for the offence is stated to be a
‘dispute over women folk. Hence, the FIR (ibid).

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. The record tells that the deceased received
a solitary injury which led to a charge against three real
brothers, though the Investigating Officer during spot

‘inspection recovered 12 empties of .30 bore from the
-3-
place of incident which were sent to the Forensic
Science Laboratory to ascertain as to whether those were
fired from one or different weapons. The report received
tells that the collected empties were fired from different
weapons and the same found favour with the learned
Court below. The learned counsel for the respondent
submitted that the number of accused charged is
substantiated from the fact that the recovered empties
were fired from different weapons and that the accused
charged are vicariously liable, regardless of the fact that
whose fire shot proved effective. It was further
submitted that the intent behind Section 34 PPC is
nothing but to cover the like situation. True, that Section
34 PPC deals with common intention, but to ascertain as
to whose fire shot proved effective, needs recording of
pro and contra evidence and no definite finding can be
given at this stage. The situation has been dealt with by

the apex Court in case titled Awal Khan and 7 others

Vs. The State through AG-KPK and another (2017
SCMR 538).

5. It is pertinent to mention that the
Investigating Officer when visited the spot and prepared

the site plan, the complainant introduced one Mst.
-4-
Nazifa Bibi as the eyewitness of the incident, but the
report is silent in that respect which is another
circumstance which finds favour with the
accused/petitioner. The prosecution is yet to explain as
to whether in case of .30 bore pistol, blackening is
possible, that too, from a distance of 3 to 4 paces. The
accumulative effect of what has been stated above leads
to an inference that the petitioner’s case is arguable for
the purpose of bail.

6. True, that while seized of a bail matter, the
Court is to make tentative assessment and deeper
appreciation is not warranted, but equally true that bail
applications cannot be heard and decided in a vacuum
and the Courts of law should apply its judicial mind to
the collected evidence, though tentatively, to avoid
miscarriage of justice and if the doubt is apparent from
record, its concession should be extended to the accused/
petitioner even at bail stage, as is held by the apex Court
in case titled Muhammad Faisal Vs. The State and
another (2020 SCMR 971), wherein it has been held
that:-

“It is established principle of law
that benefit of doubt can even be
extended at bail stage”.
-5-
7. After assessing the collected material
tentatively, this Court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the petitioner has been succeeded in
making out a case for bail. Resultantly, this petition is
allowed and the petitioner is directed to be released on
bail subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum of
Rs:2,00,000/- (rupees two lac) with two sureties, each in
the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate.

8. Above are detailed reasons of my short

order of even date. ar
