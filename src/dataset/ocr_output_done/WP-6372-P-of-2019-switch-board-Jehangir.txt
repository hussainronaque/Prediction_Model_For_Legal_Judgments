JUDGMENT

Ke

AHMAD ALI, J. Petitioner, Jehangir, through the present
petition is seeking his release on bail till final decision of the
case registered vide FIR No.520 dated 18.10.2019 u/s 9-D of
K.P. CNSA, 2019, Police Station, Risalpur, district

Nowshera.

2. Facts as divulged in the FIR are that the complainant
Jan Muhammad Khan SHO on the basis of spy information
laid picketing at Motorway Rashkai Interchange and after
sometime a motorcar, driven by the accused/petitioner,

arrived there; whereas, co-accused Daud Shah was sitting in
the car alongside the driving seat. On checking of motorcar
eight packets of Charas, containing total quantity of 9362
grams and two packets of opium containing total quantity of
2035 grams was recovered. Hence, the present FIR under the
K.P. CNSA 2019, was registered.

3. Arguments heard and record gone through.

4. Perusal of the record reveals that the accused/petitioner
was arrested having possession of 9.362 kilograms Charas
and 2.035 kilograms opium and thereby a case vide FIR
No.520 dated 18.10.2019 u/s 9-D of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 2019 was
registered at Police Station Risalpur, District Nowshera and
accordingly the accused/petitioner was arrested. Petitioner
initially preferred bail petition before the learned Addl
Sessions Judge Nowshera which was dismissed vide order
dated 26.10.2019.

5. The present case was registered under Section 9-D of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred as the Act, passed by the
Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on 27.08.2019
and published in the official gazette on 04.09.2019. Being a
special law, the provisions of the Act are to be complied with

and followed in the letter & spirit. According to the Section
28 of the Act, all the powers of entry, search, seizure and
arrest without warrant have been vested in the authorised
officer. The Section 28 of the Act, reads as under:

28. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest
without  warrant.---(1) Where an
authorized officer, who from his personal
knowledge or from information given to
him by any person, is of the opinion that
any narcotic substance is kept or concealed
in any building, place, premises, dwelling
house or conveyance and warrant for the
search or arrest cannot be obtained from the
Special Court against such person without
affording him an opportunity for the
concealment of evidence or facility for his
escape, such officer may-

(a) enter into any such building, place,
premises, dwelling house subject to
the proviso of sub-section (1) of
Section 27 of this Act;

(b) break open any door and remove any
other obstacle to such entry in case of
resistance;

(c) seize such narcotic substances,
methamphetamine and other
materials used in the manufacturing
thereof and any other article or
documents which he has reason to
believe to be liable for confiscation

or may furnish evidence of the
commission of an offence punishable
under this Act; and
(d) — search and, if he thinks proper, arrest
any person whom he has reason to
believe to have committed an offence
punishable under this Act.
(2) Before or immediately after taking
any action under sub-section (1), the
authorized officer, mentioned in sub-section
(1), shall record the grounds and basis of
his information and take immediate
necessary action and forthwith send a copy
of the same to the Director or as the case
may be to the Regional Police Officer.

6. Whereas, section 30 of the Act confers powers to the
“authorised officer” to stop and search any conveyance. The
authorised officer, as defined in Section 2(c) of the Act is
either the officer of the Directorate General not below the
rank of sub-Inspector, authorized by the Director or a Police
Officer not below the rank of sub-Inspector authorized by the
Regional Police Officer. Whereas, ‘Directorate General’
refers to the Director General of the Excise, Taxation &
Narcotics Control Department. A bare reading of the Section
2(c) of the Act makes is clear that not every sub-Inspector or
higher ranked officer of the police department can act as an
‘authorised officer’ but only the officer authorised by the

Regional Police Officer can stop & search any conveyance or
person and make seizure therefrom. However, the entire
record is silent with regard to any authorization by the
Regional Police Officer to the complainant to perform duties
as an authorised officer under the Act of 2019. Therefore, it
would be determined at trial stage as to whether seizure and
arrest etc by the complainant are legally warranted or not?
and till then the accused/petitioner cannot be detained behind
the bars where the status of Complainant himself is dubious.
7. Yet there is another noticeable legal aspect of the case
i.e. according to Section 33 of the Act of 2019, any person
arrested and articles seized under the Act shall be produced
within twenty-four hours of the arrest or seizure before the
Special Court and only a special Court has been conferred
with the jurisdiction to take any measures for the disposal of
seized articles and person arrested. Section 33 of the K.P.
CNSA 2019 is reproduced below for ready reference:

33. Disposal of articles seized and person
arrested.---(1) Any person arrested and
articles seized under this Act, shall be
produced, within twenty-four (24) hours of
the arrest or seized, before the Special

Court by whom the warrant was issued.
(2) The special Court to whom the

accused and articles etc. are produced

under sub-section (1) shall, with all

convenient dispatch, take such measures as

may be necessary for the disposal of the

articles so seized and person arrested.
8. The Special Court within the purview of Section 22 of
the Act is a Court established by the provincial government
and notified in the official Gazette for which Judges have to
be appointed after the consultation with the Chief Justice of
Peshawar High Court. There is no cavil with the proposition
that till date no notification as to the establishment of the
Special Court has been issued by the Provincial Government
of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa nor judges have been appointed
there-for. Now a legal question arises that whether in the
absence of Special Courts, the production of narcotic
substances and accused before an ordinary Court of Sessions
can fulfil the mandate of Section 33 of the Act and whether
the Court of Sessions Judge has the jurisdiction to deal with
the articles seized by the complainant and person arrested
and to pass any order regarding the fate of same. When law

provides an act to be done in a specific manner, then it should
be done accordingly. This legal infirmity makes the
accused/petitioner entitled for the concession of bail.

9. Now adverting to another aspect of the case; it is the
case of prosecution that the purported narcotics was wrapped
in different packets and was weighed by the complainant
through a digital scale. The contents of FIR as well as
possession memo dated 18.10.2019 reflect that the
contraband was weighed with wrapper, as there is nothing to
suggest that the wrapper was removed by complaint before
taking weight of each parcel. This fact makes the very
quantity of contraband doubtful and it is still a mystery that
what was the actual weight of the purportedly recovered
Charas and Opium. Besides nature of the Charas as to
whether it was Garda or Pukhta is not mentioned in the FIR
or possession memo. Moreover, there is no mention of the
destination on which the contraband was to be supplied.
Similarly, the place of despatch of the narcotic substance is
not mentioned in the FIR nor investigated by the
investigating officer. This court in the case of Tahir Khan and
another Vs. the State 2019 M _L _D 361 (Peshawar) has
already expressed the following view:

“Perusal of available record would depict

that both the accused-petitioners have been

arrested by the complainant party on the
allegations of having contraband, allegedly
to be smuggled to Peshawar, but neither the
nature of contraband either Garda or
Pukhta charas was mentioned in the FIR,
nor their destination and nor their alleged
place of communication from-where the
charas was dispatched, has been brought on
record. Furthermore, nothing was brought
on record in respect of the seized vehicle,
whether it was in the name of accused-party
or otherwise nor previous history of
accused-petitioners has been brought on
record to show their involvement in such
like activities. Since their arrest, accused-
petitioners have been __ investigated/
interrogated but neither any further
recovery has been made nor they confessed
their guilt. Moreover, a mistaken relief of
bail may be repaired by convicting the
accused, if proved guilty, but no proper
reparation can be offered for his unjustified
incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the
long run. Reliance is placed on the case of
Zaigham Ashraf v. The State and others,

reported in 2016 SCMR 18.”
10. It is undeniable fact on the face of the record that the
narcotic substances were not recovered from the immediate
possession of the accused/petitioner rather the same was
recovered from the secret cavity of the switch board; thus, the
petitioner cannot be connected with the same at this stage.
Besides, the co-accused Daud Shah, who was present
alongside the petitioner on front seat of the motorcar, has
already been admitted to bail vide order 26.10.2019,
therefore, the accused/petitioner too is entitled to the
concession of bail. Reliance is place on the case of Gulab Din
Vs. the State 2013 P Cr. L J 1160 (Peshawar).

11. For the reasons mentioned above, this petition is
allowed and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail subject
to furnishing of bail bonds in the sum of Rs.400,000/- with
two reliable sureties who shall be men of means to the

satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.

12. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of even
date.

Announced.
