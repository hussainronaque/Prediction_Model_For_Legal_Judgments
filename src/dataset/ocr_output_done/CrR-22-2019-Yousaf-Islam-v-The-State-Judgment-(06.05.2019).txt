QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The petitioner, Yousaf
Islam, who is facing trial in case FIR No. 42 dated
15.01.2016, under section 17(4), Offences against Property
(Enforcement of ‘Hudood’) Ordinance 1979 registered at
police station Aza Khel, District Nowshera, has preferred
this criminal revision against the order of the learned ASJ-
III, Nowshera dated 09.02.2019 whereby his application for
re-summoning of prosecution witnesses after alteration of
the charge was dismissed.

2. As the record unfolds, the learned trial court
on 15.03.2016 framed a formal charge under section 17(4)
Offences against Property (Enforcement of ‘Hudood’)
Ordinance, 1979 against the accused-petitioner to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial and after the closure of
the prosecution evidence, his statement under section 342
Cr.P.C was recorded and after hearing the arguments, the
case was fixed for order. However, the learned trial court
felt that the requisite standard of evidence was not
forthcoming necessitating the alteration of the charge and
accordingly fresh formal charge under section 17(4)
Offences against Property (Enforcement of ‘Hudood’)
Ordinance 1979 read with sections 302/382 PPC was
framed against the accused and the case was fixed for
arguments on the point as to whether there was any need of
recording evidence afresh or the evidence already recorded
was sufficient on the basis of which the case could be
decided. In the meanwhile, the accused-petitioner also filed
an application for re-summoning of the witnesses and after
hearing the learned counsel for the parties, the learned trial
court through the impugned order dated 09.02.2019
dismissed the application of the accused-petitioner by
holding that there was no need to re-summon the witnesses
and that the case would be decided on the basis of the
evidence already recorded. Feeling aggrieved from the said
order dated 09.02.2019; the accused-petitioner has preferred
the present petition.

3. All that the learned counsel for the petitioner-
accused vehemently contends is that the learned trial court
has committed patent error and grave illegality while
dismissing the application of the accused-petitioner for re-

summoning of the witnesses for the purpose of cross

examination in view of the altered charge and has thus
caused serious prejudice to him.

The learned counsel for the complainant on his
turn defended the impugned order of the learned trial court
and stated that the trial has been concluded and that through
the alteration of the charge, no prejudice has been caused to
the accused-petitioner.

The learned AAG also supported the

arguments of the learned counsel for the complainant.

3. Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
4. Before going to discuss the controversy

involved in the case, it is deemed appropriate to have a brief
discussion with regard to the definition, purpose and object
of the charge. Chapter XIX of the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1898 deals with the form of charges against an
accused in a criminal case. Charge has been defined in
section 4 (c) of the Cr.P.C as below:

“Charge” includes any head of charge

when the charge contains more heads than

one.”

The purpose of a charge is to tell and convey to
an accused person as precisely and concisely as possible the
criminal case in which he has to face trial and thus must
communicate to him with sufficient clarity and certainty
what the prosecution intends to bring home against him

regarding which he would have to defend himself.
Similarly, the object of a charge is to enable an
accused to concentrate his attention on the case that he has
to face before the learned trial court. By the same corollary,
if the charge is framed against the accused in an ambiguous
manner and the necessary ingredients of the offences are
not brought out in the charge and for which he may be
ultimately convicted and sentenced at the conclusion of the
trial, then of course such trial cannot be termed by any
definition to be a fair trial.

5. It would also be more apt to refer to Section
221 Cr.P.C at this stage which deals with the framing of
charge and read as:

Charge to State Offence (1) Every charge under this
Code shall state the offence with which the accused is
charged.

(2) Specific name of offence sufficient description. If
the law which creates the offence gives it any specific
name, the offence may be described in the charge by
that name only.

(3) How stated where offence has no specific name If
the law which creates the offence does not give it any
specific name, so much of the definition of the offence
must be stated as to give the accused notice of the
matter with which he is charged.

(4) — The law and section of the law against which the
offence is said to have been committed shall be
mentioned in the charge.

(5S) What implied in charge. The fact that the charge is
made is equivalent to a statement that every legal
condition required by law to constitute the offence

charged was fulfilled in the particular case.
(6)

7

Language of charge. The charge shall be written
either in English or in the language of the Court.

Previous conviction when to be set out. If the
accused having been previously convicted of any
offence is liable, by reason of such previous
conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to
punishment of a different kind, for a subsequent
offence, and it is intended to prove such previous
conviction for the purpose of affecting the
punishment which the Court may think fit to award
for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of
the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge.
If such statement has been omitted, the Court may

add it at any time before sentence is passed;

Similarly, Section 227 Cr.PC is with regard to

alteration or addition of the charge which runs as under:

6.

(1) “Any court may alter or add to any charge at
any time before judgment is pronounced and

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be
read and explained to the accused.”

The grievance of the accused-petitioner is that

after the alteration of the charge, the prosecution was bound

to have re-summoned the witnesses already examined and

to afford him with an opportunity of cross-examining them

and by not doing so, serious prejudice has been caused to

him.

Likewise, Section 231 Cr.P.C deals with

recalling of witnesses after alteration of charge which reads

as follows:

“Whenever a charge is altered or added to by

the Court after the commencement of the trial,
the prosecutor and the accused shall be
allowed to recall or re-summon, and examine
with reference to such alteration or addition,
any witness who may have been examined, and
also to call any further witness whom the court

may think to be material”.

7. Undeniably, the court has wide powers to alter
the charge at any time before the pronouncement of the
judgment. However, the same should in no manner cause
any prejudice to the accused. In this case, it is at the
conclusion of the trial when the charge has been alerted by
the learned trial court which gives an altogether different
and distinct complexion and dimension to the prosecution
case and is thus was bound to cause prejudice to the
accused-petitioner.

8. In this case, after the addition/alteration of the
charge, the accused-petitioner has submitted a proper
application for re-summoning of the witnesses to provide
him with an opportunity to cross examine the PWs which
has been dismissed through the impugned order. Before
the alteration of the charge, the focus of the defence while
cross-examining the witnesses would obviously be with
reference to the offence punishable under section 17(4)
Offences against Property (Enforcement of ‘Hudood’)
Ordinance 1979 and not to the altered charge punishable
under sections 302/382 PPC. Section 231 Cr.P.C caters to
such like situation leaving the accused at liberty to recall

and re-examine the prosecution witnesses, if he so desires.
7

Such right of an accused cannot be abridged only on the
premise that the same set of PWs would be recalled and re-
examined thereby prolonging the trial of the case. It is the
accused who is in custody and the prolongation of his trial
would only aid to his period of incarceration. Therefore, in
order to advance the object of the fair trial, it was
incumbent upon the prosecution to have re-summoned the
witnesses and provided an opportunity to the accused-
petitioner to cross-examine them as they have not been
examined in the context of the altered charge. As such, the
facts and circumstance of the case suggest that the learned
trial court has committed illegality while dismissing the
application of the petitioner-accused for re-summoning of
the witnesses and providing the defence an opportunity to
cross examine them and thereby causing prejudice to the
petitioner-accused.

9. Accordingly, this revision petition is allowed,
the impugned order dated 09.02.2019 of the learned trial
court is set aside with the directions to the learned trial
court to re-summon the prosecution witnesses and afford
every opportunity to the petitioner-accused to cross
examine them, if he so desires in order to ensure the fair
trial of the case.
