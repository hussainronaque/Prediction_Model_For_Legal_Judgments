Court at Swat in case F.I-LR No. 96 dated 06.08.2011
under Sections 302, 404, 202, 201/34 P.P.C
registered against the appellant Sultan-e-Rome and
co-convict Muhammad Ishaq at Police Station
Martung, District Shangla. Both of them were
convicted by learned trial Court under Section 302
(b)/34 P.P.C and sentenced to life imprisonment
with fine of Rs.200,000/- payable by each convict to
LRs of the deceased Syed Muhammad. In case of
default in payment of fine, it was directed that each
of the convicts shall further undergo 03 years S.L.
Benefit of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was extended to

them.

2. Detail of the occurrence emerging from
the contents of the F.I.R is that Amir Salam Khan
ASI (PW-5), pursuant to receipt of information
regarding recovery of a dead body in village Tor
Kamar on 05.08.2011, rushed to the said village
accompanied by police contingents where
complainant Sultan Muhammad (PW-2), son of the
deceased, was present alongwith his cousin
Muhammad Khitab. While making report to police
at 16:00 hours on the same day, complainant
narrated that his father Syed Muhammad was

dealing in the business of weapons in village Tor

Kamar and adjacent areas for 20/25 years and in this
respect his amount of several lacs was outstanding
against the people of the area. The complainant
stated ahead in his report that his father had left for
this area some 02 months ago for recovery of debt
and informed him through phone for the last time on
05.07.2011 that an amount of Rs.1,70,000/- has been
recovered while an amount of Rs.2,70,000/- is
outstanding against co-convict Muhammad Ishaq for
which he was staying with him and will return home
after receiving the said amount form the co-convict
on getting cash from Habib Bank, Sawari on the
following day. Complainant further stated that his
father neither arrived at home after 05.07.2011 nor
contacted him through phone, therefore, he and his
relative started search for his father some 15/16 days
ago beginning the same from Ghari Hassan Zai and
thereafter making secret probe in every village
finally reached to village Tor Kamar two days ago.
On getting information through different sources, he
got secret information that his father had been done
to death by co-convict Muhammad Ishaq and
appellant Sultan-e-Rome on 05.07.2011 at night
time in his house and buried the corpse in the fields
owned by the co-convict. Complainant informed the

police that on the day of report he searched different
fields with the help of other persons and opened a
place after getting smell of the dead body which was
recovered and it transpired that his father had been
done to death by firing on his head, right hand and
right ribs. He charged the appellant and co-convict
Muhammad Ishaq for committing murder of his
father, snatching Rs.1,70,000/- from him and

retaining the outstanding amount of Rs.2,70,000/-.

3. Report of the complainant was recorded

Muhammad aged about 60 years was examined by
Dr. Mushtaq-ul-Mulk (PW-4). After conducting

Kalashnikov and two crime empties is Ex.PZ.

5. After completion of investigation,
challan was put in Court. The appellant and co-
convict were charge sheeted for the offences on
21.09.2011 to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. Prosecution examined 14 PWs in
support of its case whereafter the appellant and co-
convict were examined in terms of Section 342,
Cr.P.C. They denied the allegations of prosecution
and stated to be innocent. Co-convict Muhammad
Ishaq recorded his statement on oath within the

meaning of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C and retracted

from his judicial confession. He further stated that
he is innocent and falsely been charged in this case.
He denied the entire evidence attributed to him
during the course of investigation including the
recovery of cash amount and the alleged crime
weapon, however, appellant declined to record his

statement on oath.

6. The learned trial Court, after
hearing the arguments of prosecution and defence,
convicted the appellant and co-convict Muhammad
Ishaq under Section 302 (b)/34 P.P.C for the murder
of deceased Syed Muhammad. They were sentenced
to life imprisonment with fine of Rs.200,000/-
payable by each convict to LRs of the deceased.
Appellant Sultan-e-Rome has challenged his
conviction through this appeal while co-convict
Muhammad Ishaq has preferred no appeal against
his conviction and sentence, however, State has filed
the connected Cr.R No. 57-M/2013_ whereby

enhancement in the sentence of both the convicts has

been prayed for.

petition, inter alia, contended that the learned trial
Court has mainly relied upon the alleged confession
of the co-convict while recording conviction of both
the convicts but the statement has not been recorded
in accordance with law rather same is the result of
pressure and torture by police. He submitted that the
confession is not only retracted one but it also gets
no corroboration from the circumstantial evidence,
as such, does not fulfill the criteria for recording
conviction. Learned counsel stressed that the story
narrated by complainant in his report is not
appealing to prudent mind and the evidence brought
on the record by prosecution is suffering from
serious frailties which have not been considered by
learned trial Court. He added that co-convict
Muhammad Ishaq has recorded his statement in
terms of Section 340 (2), Cr.P.C wherein he stated
on oath to have no nexus with murder of the
deceased but the learned trial Court did not consider
the same worth credence without making reference
to any plausible ground in this regard. He
maintained that recovery of crime empties after one
month of the occurrence is improbable and similarly
the alleged recovery of the crime weapon from the
co-convict has not been proved in accordance with

law. Learned counsel prayed that the impugned
judgment be set aside being against law and
evidence on record and the convicts be acquitted of

the charge.

8. Learned Assistant. A.G. appearing for
State also argued the case on behalf of complainant,
who has already opted to be represented by A.A.G.
He vehemently opposed the arguments of learned
counsel for the appellant and co-convict. He argued
that confession of co-convict has been recorded by
Judicial Magistrate in strict compliance with the
relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
He submitted that it was a voluntary confession
getting ample corroboration from the circumstantial
evidence, hence, there is no ground on the basis of
which that piece of evidence, having paramount
importance, could be discarded. He further
contended that an amount of Rs.85,000/- has been
recovered on pointation of co-convict besides
recovery of the dead body from the fields owned by
him and that of crime empties from the spot are the
pieces of corroborative evidence which not only give
support to confession but also proves involvement of
the convicts with murder of the deceased. He

submitted that this appeal be dismissed and sentence

of the convicts be enhanced by accepting the

connected revision petition preferred by State.

9. We have given our anxious
consideration to the above submissions of learned
counsel for the parties as well as learned Assistant

A.G. by going through the entire record.

10. Appellant Sultan-e-Rome and co-
accused Muhammad Ishaq were tried by learned
Sessions Judge, Shangla Camp Court at Swat and
vide judgment dated 03.09.2013 both of them were
convicted. Appellant Sultan-e-Rome has preferred
this appeal but the co-convict has not challenged his
conviction, however, the State has filed the
connected Criminal Revision No. 57-M/2013 for
enhancement of the sentence which is before us for

adjudication.

il. Before going into merits of the case,
first this Court would see that when the co-convict
has not challenged the judgment of the trial Court,
this Court while seized of a criminal appeal of his
co-accused, can consider his case or not. In addition
to that there is a criminal revision filed by State
wherein notice to the non-appealing respondent/

convict has been given and he is duly represented

today by his counsel by resisting the revision
petition filed by State. The proposition which is
before this court is whether the evidence can also be
appraised qua the guilt of the non-appealing co-
convict or not. State has filed the revision petition
for enhancement of sentence under Section 439,
Cr.P.C which is reproduced herein below for ready

reference.

“High Court’s powers of revision.—(1) in the
case of any proceeding the record of which
has been called for by itself, or which
otherwise comes to its knowledge, the High
Court may, in its discretion, exercise any of
the powers conferred on a Court of Appeal by
Sections 432, 426, 427 and 428 or on a court
by Section 338, and may enhance the sentence
and, when the Judges composing the court of
Revision are equally divided in opinion, the
case shall be disposed of in manner provided
by Section 429.

(2) No order under this section shall be made
to the prejudice of the accused unless he has
had an opportunity of being heard either

personally or by pleader in his own defence.

(3) Where the sentence dealt with under this
section has been passed by magistrate, the
Court shall not inflict a greater punishment
for the offence which, in the opinion of such
Court, the accused has committed, than might
have been inflicted for such offence by
Magistrate of the first class.

(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
authorize a High Court:

(a) to convert a finding of acquittal into one of

conviction; or

(b) to entertain any proceedings in revision
with respect to an order made by the Sessions

Judge under Section 439-A.

(5) Where under this Code an appeal lies and
no appeal is brought, no proceedings by way
of revision shall be entertained at the instance

of the party who could have appealed.

section, any convicted person to whom an
showing cause why his sentence should not be
to show cause against fis conviction".

From the bare reading of sub-section (6)
quoted above it is clear that if an accused has not
filed an appeal against his conviction and this Court
while exercising revisonal jurisdiction under Section
439, Cr.P.C, is under statutory obligation to hear the
convict to whom notice has been given under sub-
section (2) as by virtue of the above provision he is
also entitled to show cause against his conviction.
Learned counsel for the appellant and the convict/
respondent in the criminal revision argued the entire
case on merits, so, there is no legal embargo before
this Court to appraise the case of the non-appealing
convict on merits to adjudge as to whether the

evidence adduced by prosecution during the trial

was sufficient enough to hold him guilty or not. In
this regard we would refer the case of

“Mst. Muhammadia Vs. Zari Bacha_and_ another”

(PLD 1982 Peshawar _85) according to which

criminal revision filed by complainant was
dismissed and the convict was acquitted of the
charge. The relevant portion of the judgment and

concluding para thereof are reproduced below:

“As the accused-respondent has not filed any
appeal against his conviction and the case has
come before us in revision for the
enhancement of the sentence of the accused
respondent his counsel wanted to argue the
case on merits, therefore, he was allowed to
open the case. He vehemently decried each
and every piece of evidence that has been
brought forth by the prosecution in support of
HtS CASE... ..eeceeeeee

13. The upshot of the above discussion is that
the prosecution has not been able to make out
a case against the accused-respondent beyond
a reasonable doubt and while giving him the
benefit of doubt, we acquit him of the offence
convicted for. He is to be set at liberty if not
required in any other case.

Consequently, the revision filed by the
complainant petitioner fails and is hereby
dismissed”.

12. In addition to that even otherwise when
the Court while hearing appeal of the co-accused if
there is no revision and the co-convict has not filed
the appeal even then while exercising powers under
Section 423, Cr.P.C the Court is obliged to consider
the case of the non-appealing convict and can pass
any order according to merits of the case and

principles laid down for the appraisal of criminal
cases. Wisdom is derived from the judgment in the
case titled “Amin Ali and another Vs. The State”
(2011 SCMR 323) wherein the benefit of judgment
was given to the convict who had not preferred any
appeal against his conviction. The relevant paras of

the judgment are as under:-

“17, After considering the material available on
record, we are of the considered view that the
prosecution has failed to prove the case against
the appellants beyond any reasonable doubt.
Therefore, they are entitled for the benefit of
doubt, which is accordingly given to them. The
conviction and sentences awarded to them are
set aside, therefore, they are acquitted of the
charge. They should be released forthwith, if
not required in any other custody case.

Consequently, the appeal is allowed.

18. The benefit of this judgment is also given to
the co-convict Shabbir Hussain who has not
preferred appeal before this Court perhaps for
the reason that his sentence was only 10 years
and probably he had served out the said

sentence”.

In view of the wisdom contained in the
afore-referred judgments, the end result is that this
Court can hear the case of co-convict and appraise

the same according to the celebrated principles.

13. Coming to merits of the case, the

occurrence took place on 05.07.2011. One month

prior to that father of the complainant left Mohmand
Agency for the area in question where allegedly the
occurrence took place. The complainant kept mum
till the date i.e 05.08.2011 when the dead body of
the deceased was recovered. His version is that his
father lastly contacted him through phone on
05.07.2011 and informed him regarding recovery of
Rs.1,70,000/- from debtors and his stay with co-
convict Muhammad Ishaq till the recovery of
Rs.2,70,000/- from him. The entire story set out by
prosecution since the alleged disappearance of the
deceased on 05.07.2011, his roaming all alone in
this area with huge amount far away from his native
town and the manner for his search adopted by
complainant is not appealable to reason. Prosecution
has brought nothing with regard to phone calls
between the deceased and complainant as alleged by
him in his report. The photographs available on
record shows that the dead body was naked. This
fact persuade us to infer that there is some other
reason of the murder in the background which could
not be discovered from the available record.
Committing murder of a person at night time for the
cause of money and thereafter removing his clothes
before burial are not the befitting circumstances in

Mr. Justice ishtia Ibrahim

(Cr.A No. 213-M of 2013 Sultan-e-Rome Vs. The State and one other)

the story narrated by prosecution. Site-plan Ex.PB
was prepared by I.O on 05.08.2011 wherein the
convicts and deceased have been shown inside the
room but strangely no empty was recovered at that
time and two empties were recovered from the spot
on the following day i.e 06.08.2011 when the house
was again searched by police. In addition to that it
has not been explained in the site plan that from
where the empties were collected. The above factors
regarding recovery of the crime empties from the
spot during second search of the house and most
particularly after one month of the occurrence cast a
serious doubt on its genuineness which cannot be
ignored while adjudging the evidentiary value of the
said piece of circumstantial evidence. The site-plan
is also mute regarding bullet marks on the spot
which aspect of the case again pricks our judicial
mind regarding the mode and manner of the
occurrence. Recovery of the dead body from the
fields, in view of this Court, would not be sufficient
for guilt of the co-convict and that may be a reason
for his implication in this case by complainant.
Though medical evidence shows firearm injuries on
the person of deceased but when the dead body was
disinterred the doctor in his report did not mention

bs: Ibrahi an

TajamulPs*

-17-
any sort of soil residue on the corpse even garments
of the deceased were not taken into possession.
Moreso, there is no eye witness of the occurrence
even to the extent that the convicts were seen by
someone while burying the dead body in the fields.
In addition to that it is highly improbable that the
complainant who is hailing from far flung area
would retrieve the dead body of his father on his
own from the open fields allegedly owned by co-
convict Muhammad Ishaq. So, in our view, the
recovery of dead body and its surrounding
circumstances do not stand to reason and moreso the
mode and manner as alleged by complainant is also

not appealable to prudent mind.

14. Reverting to alleged confession
of co-convict Muhammad Ishaq, as per his card of
arrest, he was arrested on 07.08.2011 while his
statement was recorded by PW-13 Muhammad
Tayyab Jan, Judicial Magistrate on 08.08.2011. But
this is quite strange that the complainant who
appeared as PW-2 stated in his cross-examination
that:-

The above narrations of the
complainant clearly show that co-convict was
arrested on the same day when the dead body
was recovered that is 05.08.2011. His arrest
was suppressed by police on the same day and
thereafter he was kept for 02 days in wrongful
confinement without legal authority even the
Judicial Magistrate made no effort to examine
him through doctor before recording his
confessional statement. How can a confession
be regarded as true and voluntary as provided
under Article 38 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat
when recorded in the above mentioned
manner. It is well settled that voluntariness of
a confession is doubted when recorded after
unauthorized confinement of accused.
Guidance in this regard is sought from the

judgment of the Hon’ble apex Court in the

DS: Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Mr.

(Cr.A No. 213-M of 2013 Sultan-e-Rome Vs. The State and one other}
-19-
case of “The State Vs. Asfandyar Wali and 02
others” (1982 SCMR_ 321) wherein it has
been held that:-

“On the other hand, the manner in which
Asfandyar had been detained was shocking to
any one's sense of justice. As the confession on
which the learned Advocate-General relied
had been obtained after six weeks, we invited
the learned Advocate-General to produce the
remand order for Asfandyar detention. The
learned Advocate-General stated that there
was no remand order and that a remand
order was unnecessary because after the
expiry of two weeks from his arrest Asfandyar
was under detention order, but, the learned
Advocate-General was not able to produce
that detention order, nor was he able to tell us
what happened to the charge for which
Asfandyar had been detained.

In these circumstances, it is not surprising
that the learned Judge did not accept the plea
that Asfandyar was being detained under
detention older, and they were of the view that
his confession had been recorded after he had
been in illegal Police custody for six weeks,
And, the view thus taken is a possible and
reasonable view and is in consonance with the
principles repeatedly laid down by this Court
yet another circumstance relevant to the
genuineness of Asfandyar's confession which

is absolutely shocking”.

The State” (PLD 1960 Karachi 817) it was held
that:-
“Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898), Ss.
164 & 61 -Confessing-accused detained by
Police for more than 24 hours without

warrant- Voluntariness of confession
doubted.

Where a person, before his confession was
recorded, had been detained by the Police for
2 days without having obtained a remand and
no attempt was made by the prosecution to
explain the illegal detention by the police, it
was held that the confession had the
appearance of having been improperly
obtained”.

15. Record reflects that the co-convict not
only retracted from his confession during his
examination under Section 342, Cr.P.C but he also
recorded his statement on oath in terms of Section
340(2), Cr.P.C. The purpose of examination of
accused under Section 340(2) is almost different
from his examination under, Cr.P.C Section 342,
Cr.P.C with a view that statement recorded under the
former provision is tendered to disprove the case set
up by prosecution. A bare perusal of the statement
under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C reveals that the co-
convict absolutely denied all the allegations leveled
against him in this case and further alleged that
police have tortured him time and again for

recording confession. No doubt, the statement
recorded on oath by the co-convict cannot be
considered as a conclusive proof of his innocence,
however, last but not least his statement, in the view
of this Court, is sufficient to create a reasonable
doubt qua his guilt. Confronting an accused with a
question during his examination under Section 342,
Cr.P.C with a view to seek his option for recording
his statement on oath is not just a formality but the
object thereof is to enable the accused to explain his
position. When he opts to record his statement then
the Court is duty bound to appraise the same in light
of prosecution evidence but no such effort appears in

this respect on behalf of the learned trial Court.

16. No doubt, retracted confession, if
corroborated by independent evidence of reliable
nature, could be made basis for conviction of an
accused but same is not the situation in the present
case. The occurrence is unseen one, the recovery of
crime empties is also doubtful as the same has been
effected after one month of the occurrence which is
highly improbable and the dead body has been
recovered from the fields allegedly owned by co-
convict. There is not an iota of independent evidence

on record to corroborate the confession allegedly

recorded by co-convict Muhammad Ishaq, therefore,
we consider it highly unsafe to base the conviction
of both the accused on the confession having the
background discussed earlier. Wisdom is derived
from the case titled “Muhammad Ismail and others
V/s. The State” (2017 SCMR 898) wherein the

august Supreme Court held that:

“The only other piece of evidence remaining in
the field was a judicial confession allegedly
made by Muhammad Iqrar, Khalid Hussain
and Shakir Ali appellants before a Magistrate
under Section 164, Cr.P.C. but admittedly the
said judicial confession had been retracted by
the appellants before the trial Court and in the
absence of any independent corroboration such
retracted judicial confession could not suffice
all by itself for recording or upholding the
appellants’ convictions”.

17. Keeping in mind that the
confession was recorded after two days of wrongful
confinement besides there is no independent
evidence to corroborate the retracted confession, in
the considered opinion of this Court, the same
cannot be used against the co-convict. The learned
trial Court has committed an error while considering
the alleged judicial confession independent of the
prosecution as well as defence evidence available on

the record. Since, the appellant Sultan-e-Rome has

been convicted on the strength of the confessional

statement of co-convict Muhammad Ishaq which we

have disbelieved against its maker, how it can be

considered against the appellant named therein

particularly when there is no evidence is available

on record against him. In this regard we would refer

the case of “Arif Nawaz Khan and 03 others Vs. The

State” (PLD 1991 Federal Shariat Court 53).

Relevant observations recorded in the judgment on

the point under consideration are as under:-

18.

“10. In Islamic Criminal Law, the confession of
an accused against the co-accused is not
acceptable and if there is no other proof against
him, he will not be punished on the said
confession. It is based on the following hadith

Translation: "It has been related on the
authority of Sa‘d al-Sa‘idi that a man came
to the Prophet and confessed that he had
committed adultery with a woman named by
him. The Prophet (p.b.u.h.) sent for tile
woman and enquired from her about it. She
denied the allegation. The Prophet (p.b.u.h.)
punished the male but acquitted the
female." (Ibn Qudamah: Al-Mughni,
printed Riadh, Vol. VIII. page 193 (This
Hadith is stated in Al-Sunan, Abu Da‘ud)”.

In light of the above discussion and

giving cumulative effect to prosecution and defence

evidence, this criminal appeal is allowed while the

connected criminal revision petition is dismissed.

Resultantly both the convicts namely Sultan-e-Rome
