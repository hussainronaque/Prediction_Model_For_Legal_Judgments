O R D E R  
AMJAD ALI SAHITO, J – By this order, I intend to dispose of instant
post-arrest Crl. Bail Application arising out of
Crime No.167 of 2020 registered at Police Station Shaheed
Murtaza Mirani, District Khairpur for offences punishable under Sections 302, 120-B
PPC. Prior to this the bail application of the applicant/accused has been
declined by learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge/(MCTC),
Khairpur vide order dated 12-10-2021, hence this bail
application.
2.       The details and
particulars of the FIR are already available in the bail application and FIR, therefore same could be gathered from the copy of FIR
attached with such application.    
3.       It
is, inter-alia, contended by learned counsel for the applicant/accused that applicant/accused
is innocent and has falsely been implicated in this case by the complainant;
that name of the applicant/accused does not transpire in the FIR as it is an
unseen incident; co-accused Din Muhammad alias Bhojo
and Muzaffar Hussain have
been granted bail by this Court; that the case has been challaned
and the applicant/accused is no more required for the purpose of further investigation.
He lastly prayed that the applicant/accused may be admitted to bail. 
4.       Mr.
Muhammad Ali Napar advocate
files power on behalf of complainant, which is taken on record. Learned APG for
the State assisted by learned counsel for the complainant contended that the present
applicant/accused is involved in the commission of the offence; that applicant/accused
is serial killer and number of cases like murder, robbery, police encounters
and armed ordinance are registered against him at different police stations;
that the offence with which the applicant/accused is charged entails capital
punishment. 
5.       I
have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the
record.  Admittedly the present office is unseen and un-witnessed,
but he was implicated by the complainant in his further statement. Not only
this, but when the applicant/accused was arrested, crime weapon was recovered
from his possession and the empties recovered from the place of wardhat were matched and as per FSL report the same were
fired from the weapon recovered from his possession. Moreover number of cases
like murder, robbery, police encounters and armed ordinance are registered
against him at different police stations, which shows that he is a hardened and
habitual criminal. Such criminal record of the applicant/accused is also produced
by learned counsel for the complainant. The case of applicant/accused is quite
different from the case of co-accused, who have been
admitted to bail. During investigation,
the investigating officer has recorded the 161 Cr.P.C statements of PWs, who have
fully supported the version of the complainant. Sufficient material is
available on record to connect the applicant/accused with the commission of
offence. Learned counsel for the applicant has failed to point out any ill will
or malafide on the part of complainant to falsely
involve the applicant/accused in the commission of offence. It is well settled
principle of law that at the bail stage only tentative assessment is to be
made. It seems that the applicant/accused is involved in the heinous offence and
his case scarily flaws within the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. 
7.      In
view of above discussion, learned counsel for the applicant/accused has failed
to make out a good case for grant of bail in the light of sub section (2) of
Section 497 CrPC, therefore, the applicant/accused is
not entitled for concession of bail and same is dismissed accordingly.  Learned trial Court is directed to expedite
the trial and conclude the proceedings within 60 days and no adjournment shall
be granted to either party. In case learned trial Cout
fails to comply with the direction of this Court, the applicant/accused is at
liberty to file a fresh bail application on new and
available grounds, before the trial Court if so advised.  
8.      Needless,
to mention that the observations made herein above are tentative in nature and would not prejudice the case of either party at trial.
