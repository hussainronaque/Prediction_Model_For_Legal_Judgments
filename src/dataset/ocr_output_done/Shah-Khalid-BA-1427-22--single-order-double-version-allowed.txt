MOHAMMAD _ IBRAHIM _ KHAN, J:-.
This single order shall dispose of present
bail petition (Cr. MBA No.1427-P/2022) and
connected Cr.MBA No.1510-P/2022, filed
by petitioners Shah Khalid and Shah Faisal
respectively, seeking their release on bail in
one and the same case FIR No.407 dated
16.03.2022, under Sections 393/ 394/34/100
PPC, at Police Station Bhana Mari,

Peshawar.
2. As per prosecution case, petitioners
alongwith co-accused Hassan Shah deceased
were charged by complainant Abdullah for
snatching mobile and cash amount on gun
point from him and PWs Adnan and Atta
Ullah; as well as firing at them; upon which
complainant also started firing in self
defence at the accused party, due to which
petitioner Shah Khalid and _ co-accused
Hassan Shah were arrested in injured
condition while the co-petitioner Shah Faisal
decamped from the spot. Lateron, co-
accused Hassan Shah succumbed to his
injuries in the hospital. On the report of
complainant, present case was registered
against all the accused.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. No doubt, both the petitioners are
directly charged in the FIR by names but as
per contents of report, at the time of
occurrence, all the accused had muffled their
faces, out of whom two accused were

arrested in injured condition on the spot
while petitioner Shah Faisal succeeded in
decamping from the spot; however, no
source of satisfaction has been disclosed by
complainant that how he identified the
petitioner Shah Faisal and how he came to
know qua the actual name and parentage etc
of petitioner Shah Faisal, when he had
allegedly muffled his face at the time of
occurrence. Even no proper identification
parade in respect of petitioner Shah Faisal
has been conducted through complainant or
other prosecution witnesses present on the
spot in support of version of complainant,
making it a case of further inquiry. Besides,
no crime weapon has been recovered from
the immediate possession of petitioner Shah
Faisal or at his instance and pointation,
making his case arguable for the purpose of
bail.

5. So far as petitioner Shah Khalid is
concerned, he alongwith co-accused have
been assigned the role of indiscriminate

firing at complainant party but surprisingly
none from the complainant party received a
single fire arm injury or even a scratch from
the said indiscriminate firing allegedly made
by all the accused; rather petitioner and co-
accused Hassan Shah sustained injuries from
the firing of complainant party, due to which
co-accused Hassan Shah succumbed to his
injuries lateron in the hospital, creating
doubt qua mode and manner of the
occurrence advanced by the prosecution.

6. Initially the bail petitions (BA
No.1029-P/2022) and BA No.1182-P/2022)
filed by petitioners were dismissed as
withdrawn by this Court vide order dated
22.04.2022, wherein investigation officer
was directed to record statements of
petitioners on their choice under Section 161
Cr.PC or before learned Judicial Magistrate
concerned and thereafter, petitioners were
kept at liberty to file fresh bail petition if so
desired. In their statements under Section
164 Cr.PC, they have charged the

complainant party for attempting to commit
their Qatle Amd as well as committing Qatle
Amd of co-accused Hassan Shah denying
the allegations levelled against them.
Amongst the petitioners, Shah Khalid is
admitted in LRH-MTI, Peshawar, whose
condition is pathetic on account of injuries
sustained at the hands of complainant. The
physician note prescribes the condition of
petitioner Shah Khalid as under:-

“the patient condition is weak,
lethargic, desaturated and_ pale
looking and absolutely unfit for
mobilization. We donnot recommend
patient mobilization for Court
statement. The patient may
experienced severe irreversible injury/
anomaly. Therefore, it is strongly
advised to take statement at bedside.”

Besides, the reasons given in the preceding
Paras and the medical ground available for
petitioner Shah Khalid, the most important
aspect for consideration of granting bail to
the petitioners is the non applicability of
Sections 393/394 PPC, as the petitioners
cannot be saddled for inflicting hurt to the
complainant during so far _ robbery,

indicating that both the sections would not
be attracted for reasons under version put
forthwith by the complainant in the First
Information Report and even in_ the
investigation lasted on the same footing.
Despite remaining in police custody,
petitioners have not made any confession
before the competent Court nor the
prosecution has collected any material
which could link the petitioners with the
gang of robbers, therefore, applicability of
sections of law levelled against petitioners
would be seen during trial after recording
pro & contra evidence. At present the above
facts make the case of both the petitioners
arguable for the purpose of bail.
Consequently, both these bail petitions are
allowed and the petitioners Shah Khalid and
Shah Faisal are admitted to bail subject to
furnishing bail bonds to the tune of
Rs.100,000/- (one lac) each with two
sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned trial Court/

Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate concerned
who shall ensure that the sureties are local,
reliable and men of means.

The ibid observations are the tentative
assessment of the material available on the
record of the case, which shall not influence
the mind of the learned trial Court in any
manner at the time of trial.

Announced.

27.06.2022.
