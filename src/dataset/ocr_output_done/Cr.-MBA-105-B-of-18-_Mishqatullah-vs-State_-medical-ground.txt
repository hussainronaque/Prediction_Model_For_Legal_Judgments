JUDGMENT
SHAKEEL _AHMAD, _J.- Through this criminal

miscellaneous bail petition, the appellant Mishqatullah
seeks post arrest bail in crime report No. 159 dated
04.05.2014, registered under section 302/324/34 PPC at
police station Basia Khel, district Bannu.

2. The prosecution case, as set forth in the crime
report, are that on 04.05.2014, at 810 hours, the
complainant Abdur Rehman Khan reported the matter to
the police in the mortuary of civil hospital, Bannu; that
on the day of occurrence, he alongwith his son Israr Khan
were present at their chowk in the village, when at about

07:15 hours, the accused Qismatullah (now acquitted),
-2-

Kashif and Mishkatullah (present petitioner), duly armed

with .30 bore pistol came there and started firing at him

and his son Israr Khan, resultantly, Israr Khan was hit

and got seriously injured, while the complainant escaped

unhurt, luckily. After commission of offence, the accused

decamped from the spot. The complainant with the help

of his co-villagers shifted the injured Israr Khan to the

civil hospital Bannu, however, he succumbed to his

injuries in the Hospital. Motive as alleged in the crime

report is scuffling between the son of Hafizullah (son of

the complainant) and the accused party some 2/3 days

ago prior to the occurrence, hence, the accused were

charged in the crime report. Vide order dated 05.04.2018,

the petitioner was declined bail by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-V, Bannu, hence, this petition.

3. It has been argued by the learned counsel for

the petitioner that the petitioner is suffering from ailment;

that he was examined by the standing Medical Board,

where he was advised regular physiotherapy; that he

needs to stay in Hospital where the facilities of
-3-

physiotherapy is available; that on 04.05.2014,

supplementary statement of the complainant was

recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C, wherein, he charged

Qismatullah, Latifullah and Kashif Ali for committing

murder of his son and attempting at his life, excluding the

name of the petitioner; that in the supplementary

statement, the complainant alleged that the accused had

come to the spot on motorcycle, but in the crime report,

he had not stated so; that vide judgment dated

24.05.2017, the co-accused Qismatullah has already

been acquitted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-

IV, Bannu on the same set of evidence; that the petitioner

resides at Karachi and when he learnt about the instant

case, he appeared before the Court, on 05.4.2018, his ad-

interim bail was recalled; that bail could not be withheld

merely on absconsion, if the accused is otherwise entitled

for bail; that the prosecution case requires further inquiry

into the guilt of the accused/petitioner, therefore, he

deserves the concession of bail.
-4-

4. Conversely, the learned counsel for

complainant vehemently opposed the contention of the

learned counsel for the petitioner and argued that the

medical report relied upon by the learned counsel for

petitioner for grant of bail to the petitioner is neither

satisfactory nor sufficient for this purpose; that after

commission of offence, the petitioner remained at large

for quite sufficient time; that acquittal of co-accused is of

no help to the petitioner; that the complainant disowns

his supplementary statement.

5. The learned Additional Advocate General

appearing on behalf of the State while supporting the

contention of the learned counsel for the complainant,

added that the petitioner has specifically been charged in

the FIR; that the medico-legal report, site plan and

version of the complainant, if placed in a juxta-position

are consistent inter alia; that there exists a prima facie

case against the petitioner, therefore, he does not deserve

the concession of bail.
-5-

6. I have carefully considered the arguments of

the learned counsel for the parties and perused the

material placed on record.

7. Perusal of the record reveals that petitioner is

involved in crime report No.159 dated 04.05.2014,

registered under sections 302/324/34 PPC at police

station, Basia Khel for committing murder of one Israr

Khan and attempting at the life of the complainant. The

petitioner claims to have chequered history of ailment.

He applied for grant of bail on medical ground as well as

on merits, but, vide order dated 06.04.2018, the learned

trial Court declined bail to the petitioner. On the previous

date vide order dated 27.04.2018, with the mutual

consent of the parties, the Superintendent Jail was

directed to make arrangements to refer the petitioner to

the Medical Board for examination of his condition,

framing the following questions.

I. Nature and type of ailment, the

petitioner is suffering from?
-6-

2. Whether the petitioner needs
specialized treatment outside
the jail hospital?
3. Whether the petitioner cannot be
treated inside the jail?
4. Whether further detention of
petitioner in jail is hazardous — to
his life.
5. Whether facility of physiotherapy
cannot be provided to
the petitioner inside the jail.
8. The petitioner was accordingly produced
before the Standing Medical Board, consisting of Dr.
Jamal Abdul Nasir, Chairman Standing Medical Board,
Medical Superintendent Police Services Hospital,
Peshawar, Dr. Faridullah, Physician Police /Services
Hospital Peshawar, Dr. Ameenullah Ophthalmologist
Police/Services Hospital, Peshawar, Dr. Mumtaz Ali
Neuro Surgeon LRH, Peshawar and Dr. Umar Ayub
Khan, Secretary/Chief Orthopedic Surgeon. The Standing
Medical Board, after examining the petitioner submitted

its report. The sum and substance of the report of

Standing Medical Board are as under.
-7-

“The Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that the petitioner has history
of Ankylosing Spondylitis Grade-I, on
examination choronic low backache
morning stiffness, the pain and
stiffness increases with prolong rest.
On examination restricted — spinal
moments by with bilateral facet
arthropathy, SLR effected bilaterally,
ALA 27 is positive, MRI shows that
degenerative changes without
cord/root compression.

He _ is advised __ regular
physotherpy with strengthening
exercise, T.A.B CARA 20 mg (BD)
tab: muscorim (BD) cap: Esso 40 mg
(OD). He is advised to follow up the
visits regularly. For his regular
Physiotherapy he needs to stay in
Hospital set up where such facilities
are available for minimum six to

twelve weeks. (6/12) weeks time.

9. It is pertinent to mention here that the

Standing Medical Board constituted to examine the

petitioner gave a definite finding that he has the history

of Ankylosing Spondylitis Grade-I and he is suffering

from low backache morning stiffness, the pain increases

with prolonged rest and restricted spinal movements with
-8-

bilateral facet arthropathy and suggested regular

Physiotherapy and stay in the Hospital for minimum six

to twelve weeks, where such the facilities of

physiotherapy are available. Admittedly, this facility is

not available inside the Central Jail of Bannu.

10. Under similar circumstances, the August

Supreme Court of Pakistan in Ismail Sheikh’s Case

(1993 SCMR _ 11460) admitted the accused on bail with

following observations.

“Now the question arises for
consideration whether finding of three
medical experts making diagnosis of
the illness of the petitioner with
positive recommendation that he needs
medical treatment which may not be
possible in jail can be rejected and
brushed aside particularly when there
is no challenge to the authenticity of
the report of the Board that it is
factually incorrect or obtained for
extraneous consideration. Since there
was no challenge, Chairman or
Members of the Medical Board were
not called in the Court to explain any
aspect of the report which was

deficient.
6. In a non-bailable case punishable
with death or imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for 10 years, proviso to
section 497, Cr. P.C. envisages that the
Court may direct that any person
under the age of 16 years or any
woman or any sick or infirm person
accused of such offence be released on
bail. Mr. Naeemur Rehman, Standing
Counsel for the Federal Government
was unable to satisfy us about the
sustainability of order of Special
Appellate Court rejecting bail in view
of positive finding of Medical Board
constituted by the Court with the
consent of the counsel appearing for
the parties particularly when no
challenge was made or dispute raised
with regard to the authenticity of

report of three medical experts.”

11. From the above discussion, it becomes crystal

clear that the bail on medical ground can be granted

under Section 497 Cr.P.C, if the Court comes to the

conclusion on the basis of medical report that the

ailment, with which, the petitioner is suffering is such

that it cannot be properly treated while custody in jail and
-10-

that he needs some specialized treatment. In the case

before me there is specific report of the Standing Medical

Board constituted to examine the condition of the

petitioner that he needs regular physiotherapy for six to

twelve weeks in the hospital wherever such facility of

treatment is available.

12. Averting to the merits of the case, no doubt,

the petitioner is one of the nominated accused in the

crime report, but on 04.05.2014, supplementary

statement of the complainant was recorded, wherein, he

stated that at the time of report, he was not in senses,

however, he added that the accused had came to the spot

on a motorcycle bearing registration No. MLF-8186 and

after commission of offence, they left the said motorcycle

on the spot and charged Qismatullah, Latifullah and

Kashif Ali, excluding the name of the petitioner, which

leads me to the conclusion that the case of the petitioner

squarely falls within the ambit of sub-section 2 of Section

497 Cr.P.C, therefore, he deserves the concession of bail

even on merits.
-ll-

13. Adverting next to the absconsion of the
accused admittedly, the petitioner was arrested on
05.04.2018, when his pre-arrest bail was declined but, he
stated that he was residing at Karachi to earn his
livelihood and after arrival, he came to know about the
case, he surrendered before the Court. It is now settled
that bail cannot be refused to the accused merely on
absconsion, if his case is otherwise fit for grant of bail. In

this respect reliance can well be placed on the case

reported as “Muhammad _Aslam_Vs_the State”(2016

SCMR 1520), wherein it was observed as under:

“S. 497(2)---Bail---Case of further
inquiry into guilt of accused---
Abscondment of accused--- Effect---
Person absconding after an
occurrence and declared as a
proclaimed offender may lose his
claim to exercise of discretion in his
favour by a court of law on the basis
of propriety but at the same time it was
equally true that an accused person
involved in a case calling for further
inquiry into his guilt was to be
admitted to bail as a matter of right---
Whenever a question of propriety was
confronted with a question of right the

latter must prevail.”
-12-

In the case reported as “Safdar Hussain Vs The State

etc” (PLJ 2017 SC 115), the august Supreme Court of

Pakistan, while granting bail to the petitioner held that

mere abscondance or commencement of trial is no

ground for refusal of bail, if the petitioner is entitled to

the same on the ground of further inquiry.

14. For what has discussed above, I accept this

petition and admit the petitioner to bail subject to

furnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs. 200000/- (two lac)

with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of the Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate concerned.

15. These were the reasons of my short order of

the even date.

Announced.
