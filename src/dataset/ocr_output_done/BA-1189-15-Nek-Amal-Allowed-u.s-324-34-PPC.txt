IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT,
PESHAWAR

(Judicial Department)

BA No. 1189-P/2015.

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing. 13.7.2015

Petitioner (Naik Mal) By M/S Hussain Ali and Gul Daraz Khan,
Advocates.

State: By Mr. Muhammad Riaz Khan Paindakhel,
AAG.

Complainant. By Syed Abdul Fayaz, Advocate.

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. The petitioner,
Naik Mal, seeks bail in case FIR No. 925 dated
13.6.2015 registered under sections 324/ 34 PPC, Police
Station Bhana Mari, Peshawar after the said relief was
declined to him by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I Peshawar on 25.6.2015.

2. Allegations against the accused-petitioner are that
on the fateful date and time, the complainant and his
brother Zahirullah were present on the spot when in the
meanwhile, owing to a previous quarrel, the accused-

petitioner alongwith his co-accused namely, Ajmal,
Sangar, Bashar, Romal, and Sabaun' sons of

Rahmatullah duly armed with fire arms came there and

started firing at them which resulted into causing fire

arm injuries on his person while his brother escaped

unhurt, hence the FIR ibid.

Arguments heard and record perused.

3. In the present case, the complainant alleges to

have been present on the spot alongwith his brother

Zahirullah when the accused-petitioner alongwith his

four brothers arrived there and started firing at them

with their respective weapons with which he was

injured. Despite indiscriminate firing by five persons not

a single crime empty has been retrieved from the spot.

Secondly, the complainant having been hit on the non-

vital parts of the body despite being at the mercy of five

armed persons certainly raises the question as to

whether there was any intention on the part of the

assailants to make an attempt at the lives of the

complainant and his brother. Moreover, for two injuries

on the non-vital parts of the body of the complainant,
five brothers have been charged and the probability of

false implication in view of the prevalent tendency in

the society to throw a wide net to rope in many persons

of a family cannot be ruled out. All such circumstances

certainly take the case of the accused-petitioner to one

of further enquiry and thus entitling him to the

concession of bail.

Resultantly, this bail petition is allowed and the

accused-petitioner is granted bail provided he furnishes

bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200000/- (Two lac) with two

sureties, each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of

the learned trial court which shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

Announced:
