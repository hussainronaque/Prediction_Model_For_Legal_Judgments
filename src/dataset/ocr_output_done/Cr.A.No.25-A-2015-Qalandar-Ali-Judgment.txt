Mansehra, therefore, this single judgment/order shall

so dispose of the aforementioned appeals/revision.
The case was registered on the report of
Mst. Pakeeza,. complainant, who reported to the

police in Police Station City Mansehra that after
appearing in the paper of chemistry in Sky
International College from 0900 hours to 1200
hours, she along with her friend Mst Anam Saleem,
daughter of Muhammad Saleem, resident of Dab
No.2, started for her home and when reached near
Abasin College at 12:30 hours a black colour corolla
car was found there. According to the complainant,
she was made to sit in the car by the said Anam
Saleem. In the car, two young boys namely Qari
Naseer and Hussain were already present, who
locked the car and Qari Naseer drove the car towards
Balakot road, wherefrom the car was reversed by
them when they saw the traffic police and in the
meantime a third young boy namely Muhammad
Faizan alias Faizi emerged from the boot of the car
and took the rear seat close to Anam Saleem, and
when the car reached near GhazikKot on return, Qari

Naseer handed over steering of the car to Hussain

and himself occupied the rear seat while Faizan alias

Peshaws: itigh aizi took the front seat and Qari Naseer committed

rape on her. The car was then driven to APS
Abbottabad and on return there-from Qari Naseer
took the driving seat while Faizan alias Faizi

committed rape, and then returned to Mansehra

Township, where she and Anam Saleem were
dropped and after taking mobile phone of Mst Anam
Saleem, they went away. On reaching home, she
narrated the occurrence to her uncle Mirza Arshad
Zaman who brought her to the Police Station for
lodging the report, wherein, she charged Qari
Naseer, Faizan alias Faizi, Hussain and Mst Anam
Saleem for commission of the offences.

3. After registration of the case, investigation
was conducted and on completion of investigation,

challan was submitted in the Anti Terrorism Court

\\

azara Division, Abbottabad ,leading to trial of the
accused named in the FIR. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Judge, ATC, Abbottabad, found accused Qari
Naseer and Faizan alias Faizi guilty of offence under
Section 376 (1) PPC and convicted and sentenced
them to undergo R.I for 14 years. Accused Hussain
son of Mushtaq Ahmed was also found guilty of
offence under Section 376 (1) PPC but was convicted
and sentenced to R.I for ten years. Co-accused Mst

Anam Saleem was acquitted of the charges, vide

ve Copimpugned judgment dated 05.03.2015. The

judgment of conviction and sentences was, however,

, Peshawa - A
4 Abbottabad .
ape at ee th IFAENS

_Aatnarized Unde 796

ecorded by the learned Judge, ATC, after holding
4

that there was nothing on file to show that the
offence was designed to create panic, fear or
insecurity in the General Public, hence, the attraction
of ATA was ruled out; but at the same time, it was
held that despite this, the Court was free to decide
the case under ordinary law as the superior Courts in
a ‘host of cases’ had done so without de novo trials.
It may be added here that the ‘host of case’ were not
referred to, but a long list of reported cases, referred
to .by counsel for the parties, was furnished
separately at the tail end of the judgment, without
specifying as to what were those ‘host of cases’
herein the superior Courts had decided the cases
under ordinary law without de novo trials.
4. After marathon arguments, stretching over
several days, the learned counsel for the parties
converged on the point that a judgment without
jurisdiction was not sustainable. It may be pointed
out here that in the impugned judgment, the learned

Judge, ATC,had vividly concluded that there was

nothing on the file to show that the offence was

signed to create panic, fear or insecurity in the
Aggottabad Ben
Autins oo? Under SecaP§ acts €

eral public, hence, the attraction of ATA was

ruled out. Needless to say that an Anti Terrorism
Court is vested with jurisdiction under Section 12 of
the Anti Terrorisms Act, 1997, only to try cases
under the Anti Terrorism Act, as there is a special
provision under Section 23 of the Act to transfer
cases of offences, which were not scheduled offences,
to ordinary Courts. It is worthwhile to reproduce the
provision of Section 23 ATA as under;
“Power to transfer cases to regular
Courts.- Where, after taking cognizance of
an offence, (Anti Terrorism Court) is of
opinion that the offence is not a scheduled
offence, it shall, notwithstanding that it
has no jurisdiction to try such offence,
transfer the case for trial of such offence
to any Court having jurisdiction under the
= Code, and the Court to which the case is
Z transferred may proceed with the trial of
the offence as if it had taken cognizance of
the offence.”
5. The word ‘shall’ used in the section leaves
no discretion with the Anti Terrorisms Court once it
forms opinion that the offence is not a scheduled
offence. In this case, there is no doubt that the
learned Anti Terrorism Court formed the opinion that

the offences were not scheduled offences, therefore,

! Terrorisms Court to transfer the case for trial to the

ourt of ordinary jurisdiction. The language of the

section is also clear with regard to the stage when
the case can be transferred under the provision,
which is after taking cognizance of the offence by the
Anti Terrorism Court. Obviously, not only cognizance
was taken by the Anti Terrorism Court, but trial was
also conducted and judgment was rendered on the
conclusion of trial.

6. Having said that, we found no second
opinion about remand of the case to the Court of
ordinary jurisdiction under the Cr.PC for proceeding
with trial of the offences as if it had taken cognizance
of the case. It may not be out of place to point out
here that the learned Judge, ATC, proceeded on
wrong premise while holding that superior Courts
had decided cases under ordinary law without de
novo trials, as there was difference in decision of
cases in appeal and decision at the trial stage.
Anyhow, it is an. established principle of law that a
judgment passed without jurisdiction is nullity in the
eye of law. There was also consensus that the

learned Judge, ATC, arrived at the conclusion that

Atified tO AN
Peshawar eign court

Asctontend Under 8ana7 6 ArUs RSIS

the offences with which the accused were charged

were not scheduled offences while recording

judgment, therefore, there was no need of de novo
trial, and the ordinary Court was to proceed with the
case from the stage of final decision.

7. There were, however, heated arguments
whether the accused would enjoy the pre-judgment
status i.e to remain on bail or confine in jail; or their
conviction in the case and sentence awarded to them
would have any bearing on their erstwhile status;
but the arguments ended on the agreed note that
with setting aside the judgment, conviction and
sentence, the accused would revert back to their
pre-judgment position.

8. In view of the forgoing discussion, the
impugned judgment dated 05.03.2015 of the learned
judge, ATC, Abbottabad is set aside, together with
the conviction and sentences there-under; and the
case stands transferred to the Court of learned
Sessions Judge, Mansehra, for decision afresh after
providing opportunity of hearing to the parties.

Accused Qari Muhammad Naseer and Muhammad

Faizan alias Faizi were in custody at the time of
decision of the case, therefore, they shall remain in
custody, as before. Accused Husain Mushtaq was on
bail, but was sent behind the bars after his

conviction and sentence in the case. Therefore, he

be released on bail subject to his furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.400000/- with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, Mansehra. Accused
Anam Saleem was also on bail at the relevant time
but since she was acquitted in the case and not
taken into custody, she need not furnish fresh bail
bonds and shall remain on bail, as before.

9... The appeals and revision petition are

disposed of accordingly.
