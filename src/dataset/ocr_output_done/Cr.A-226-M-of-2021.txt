2. Facts shortly of the instant case are that
the complainant/victim, Mst. Marwa, (PW/APW-6),
aged about 11 years, alongwith her mother and uncle,
Muhammad Badshah, reported the matter to the local
police on.§].07.2018 at 14:30 hours, to the effect that
she had gone to water spring situated in Khwar Undesa
on 27.06.2018 for brining water. While she was busy
in filling the pitcher with water, the present appellant/
convict Farid Ullah came over there at about 09:30
hours, caught her with her hand and took to the nearby
bushes. He subjected her to rape, whereafter, he left the
victim and went away. She charged the appellant/
convict for the commission of offences in hand.
Murasila was drafted, which culminated into
registration of the case against the appellant/convict

at the Police Station concerned.

3. After completion of investigation, challan
was submitted against the appellant/convict before the
learned trial Court. Copies were supplied to him
u/s, 265-C, Cr. PC. Charge was farmed against him
ws. 530f the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection
and Welfare Act, 2010 and section 376, PPC. He

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution examined as many as
eight (08) PWs. Statement of the appellant/convict was
also recorded w/s. 342, Cr.P.C, in which he was
afforded an opportunity of evidence in defence and/or
statements on oath, so he denied the allegations of
prosecution by recording his statement on oath in terms
of Section 340(2), Cr.P.C, but he did not examine any

witness in defence.

5. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
Court vide judgment dated 03.01.2019, convicted the

appellant as under: -

i. Under section 376 (3) PPC to undergo
life imprisonment alongwith fine of
Rs. 100,000/-, or in default thereof, he
was ordered to suffer six months-S.I;

ii, Under section 53 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and
Welfare Act, 2010, to undergo ten years
imprisonment alongwith fine of Rs.
100,000/-, or in default thereof, he was
ordered to undergo six months. S.I.-

Both the sentences were ordered to be run
concurrently. The benefit of section 382-B, Cr. P.C.,

was extended to the appellant.

6. The appellant/convict, preferred an appeal
(Cr.A No.48-M/2019) before this Court. His counsel
raised an objection that at the time of the incident, his

age as per his Form “” was recorded 14 years 11

‘Mushtag Akinad!* {0.B) HON'BLE MR[USTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'SLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL
-4.

months and 17 days, which means he was a child under
section 2(b) of the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018
(the “Act”). His counsel further objected that his trial
was to be conducted by a special Court under the Act.
Accepting the objection, this Court vide judgment
dated 26.11.2020 allowed the appeal and remanded the
case to the learned trial Court with the following

directions: -

“To conduct a proper inquiry according to
law qua the age of the appellant either by
itself or through a competent police officer.
The learned trial Court shall thereafter
record the statement of police officer, if so,
appointed for conducting inquiry, as well as
the statement of any other witness deemed
necessary in this regard. If it is found that
the appellant was juvenile at the time of
occurrence, then on his application the trial
Court shall summon any witness for his
examination or re-examination of witnesses
already examined. If, after conducting
inquiry, the appellant is proved to be above
the age of 18 years at the time of occurrence,
the trial Court in that eventuality shall
announce the judgment after hearing the
parties. The parties shall appear before the
Court on 22.12.2020. Needless to mention
that the learned trial Court shall positively
compete the process within four months.
During the said period, the appellant shall
be treated as under trial prisoner.”

7. Complying with the above order, the
learned Trial Court, conducted an inquiry about the age
of appellant and in the light of inquiry report (Ex
CW1/1), the date of birth of the appellant/convict was

determined as 10.07.2003. Charge was re-framed

against the appellant on 07.01.2021 by the special

Court under the Act and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child

Protection & Welfare Act, 2010.

8. The learned trial Court provided full
opportunity to the parties for recording further
evidence, if, they so wished. The prosecution relied
upon its evidence already recorded on file while the
defence requested for calling the complainant Mst.
Marwa, Lady Dr. Hina Zia, ASI Muhammad Araq
Khan and ASI Juma Rahman ASI, for re-cross-
examinations and relied on the cross-examination of
other PWs already recorded. The learned trial Court
called the above witnesses for re-cross examinations
and thereafter recorded the statement of appellant a
fresh u/s. 342, Cr.P.C, in which he was afforded an
opportunity of statement on oath as per evidence in

defence, which he did not avail.

9. We have heard arguments of Mr. Abdul
Halim Khan, learned counsel for the appellant and
Mr. Haq Nawaz, learned Assistant Advocate General,

for the State and perused the record.

10. Admittedly Mst. Marwa, the victim, is a

child. Article 3 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984

Marktoy Aimed” (0.8) HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. IUSTICE Br. MHURSHID IOBAL
-6-
(“QSO”) provides as to who may testify. For the sake

of ready reference, it is reproduced below:

“3. Who may testify: AH persons shall be
competent to testify unless the Court
considers that they are prevented from
understanding the questions put to them, or
from giving rational answers to those
questions, by tender years, extreme old age,
disease, whether of body or mind or any
other cause of the same kind:

Provided that a person shall not be
competent to testify if he has been convicted
by a Court for perjury or giving false
evidence:

Provided further that the provisions of the
first proviso shall not apply to a person
about whom the Court is satisfied that he
has repented thereafter and mended his
ways:

Provided further that the Court shall
determine the competence of a witness in
accordance with the qualifications
prescribed by the injunctions of Islam as
laid down in the Holy Qur'an and Sunnah
for a witness, and. where such witness is not
forthcoming the Court may take the
evidence of a witness who may be available.

Explanation: A lunatic is not incompetent to
testify unless he is prevented by his lunacy
from understanding the questions put to
him and giving rational answers to them.”

Article 17 of QSO speaks about the

competence and number of witnesses as under:

“17. Competence and number of witnesses:
(1) The competence of a person to testify,

and the number of witnesses required in any
case shall be determined in accordance with
the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the
Holy Qur'an and Sunnah:

(2) Unless otherwise provided in any law
relating to the enforcement of Hudood or
any other special law: —

Mushteq Aimed” (0.8) HOM'BLE ME-IUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL
-7-

a) in matters pertaining to financial or
future obligations, if reduced to
writing, the instrument shall be
attested by two men or one man and
two women, so that one may remind
the other, if necessary, and evidence
shall be led accordingly ; and

b) in all other matters, the Court may
accept, or act on the testimony of one
man or one woman or such other
evidence as the circumstances of the
case may warrant.”

11, In the case of Raja Khurran Ali Khan
and others v. Tayyaba Bibi and others (Cr.A Nos,
120, 121, and 122 of 2019), august the apex Court
held that it is imperative to ensure that a child or the
person who testifies shall have the capacity and
intelligence of understanding the questions put to him,
and who shall also be able to rationally respond to the

questions. This is known as rationality test. The Court

referred to the case of The State through Advocate
General, Sindh, Karachi y. Farman Hussain and
others (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 1). In this case, it
was held that the issue of evidence of a child is a
delicate one, which requires great care to ensure that
no element of coaching is involved. The Court further
held that the evidence of child witness should not be
relied upon unless it is corroborated by some evidence
on the record as a rule of precedence. The issue is of
universal importance. Reference may be made to the

cases from other jurisdiction. A leading case is that of

Mosttey Aimed” (0.8) HON'BLE MRAIUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MB. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL
-8-
R. vy. Marquard of the Supreme Court of Canada. In

this case, the Court observed:

“,.. (1) the capacity to observe (including
interpretation); (2) the capacity to recollect;
and (3) the capacity to communicate.

[.«]

The judge must satisfy him or herself that
the witness possesses these capacities. Is the
witness capable of observing what was
happening? Is her or she capable of
remembering what he or she observes? Can
he or she communicate what he or she
remembers? The goal is not to ensure that
the evidence is credible, but only to assure
that it_meets the minimum threshold of

being receivable.
[...]

Generally speaking, the best gauge of
capacity is the witness’s performance at the
time of trial.

[.+.]

(T)The test outlines the basic abilities that
individuals need to possess if they are to
testify. The threshold is not a high one.
What is required is_ the basic ability to
perceive, remember and communicate.
[once{_This established, deficiencies of
perception, recollection of the events at issue
may be dealt with as matters going to the

weight of the evidence.” [R. v. Marquard
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 223]

Further dilating upon the significance of
the testimony of a child victim, the Canadian Supreme
Court further observed that even a Court may allow an
out of Court statement of a child witness as an

exception to the hearsay rule. The reason cited for this

Mtusktag Akmad!® (D.B) HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID JOBAL
-9-
was need and search of truth. [R. v. Khan [1990] 2

S.C.R. 531].

12. Reverting to the case in hand, we would
now scrutinize the testimony of the victim. At the
beginning, it is worth mentioning that no rationality
test of the victim was carried out by the learned trial
Judge. It appears that the learned trial Judge did not
consider it necessary. Article 3 of the QSO, as
reproduced above, shows that it is the duty of the Court
to see if the witness is prevented from understanding
the questions put to him or from giving rational
answers for the reasons recorded therein. There is no
hard and fast rule for determination of competency of a
child witness. [Muhammad Ilyas v. Kabir Hussain
(2003 YLR 806)]. As a matter of legal requirement, it
is the intelligence of a child witness to testify in the
circumstances of a given case and not the factor of his
or her age. [Zatoon Bibi v. State (1998 P Cr. LJ
1680)]. As we shall see shortly even otherwise, the
victim demonstrated the capacity to understand the

questions and to give rational answers.

13, The prosecution case is based on the
statements of the victim Mst. Marwa (PW-6) and a

Woman Medical Officer, Dr. Hina Zia, from District

“Mushtaq Akmud!* (0.8) HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID 1OBAL,
-10-
Headquarter Hospital Timergara (PW-2). In her

examination-in-chief, the victim reiterated the story of
the incident recorded in the FIR. She re-stated that on
27.06.2018, while she was filling her earthen pot (S44)
at Khwar Ondesa Chashma/ spring, at about 09:30
a.m., the appellant Farid Ullah son of Alif Said of
Village Ondesa Lajbok, district Lower Dir, came there,
took hold of her and took her down the spring towards
bushes, where he raped her. On that day, she did not
disclose the incident to anyone in her house. On
01.07.2018, four days after the first incident, while she
was again on the way to the aforesaid spring, she found
the appellant near around the spring. Due to fear, she
went back to her house and told her mother and her
uncle about the incident of rape on 27.06.2018. Her
mother and uncle took her to the Police Station,
situated in Balambat town, where she made the report.
She acknowledged the report as correct and took her
signature thereon. Her uncle verified her report. She
saw her report in the Court and accepted its contents in
her examination-in-chief. After the report, she
produced to the police her clothes she was wearing on
the day of the occurrence. The police took her to the
hospital in Timergara, where she was medically

examined. She pointed out the place of the occurrence

Muskie Aimed” (D.8)  HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAG
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-ll-

to the Investigating Officer in the presence of her
uncle. She was cross examined on 25.10.2018 before

the remand of the case.

14. After the remand of the case, she was
subjected to further cross-examination on 20.01.2021,
as APW-6. In the first round, she was subjected to
lengthy cross-examination. She was challenged on
certain aspects. First, when asked up to which class she
has attended the school, she replied that she has
dropped out from her school some 3/4 years ago.
Second, she was asked if any relative of her visited to
her house in the night. She replied in the negative.
Third, she was asked that 2/3 years ago some persons
used to throw stones in the house of her uncle. In this
context, it was suggested to her that there was a
dispute/enmity between her uncle and the appellant
and a quarrel had taken place. She denied that
suggestion as well. Fourth, she was asked that there is
a water connection to her house from two water supply
schemes. She said yes but she replied that her family
gets cold water from the spring. There were no further
suggestions to the effect that she had no pretext to go
to the spring while there is a water connection to her

house from the village water scheme. Fifth, it was told

Mushtog Akmad!* (0.8) HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAO NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-12-

to her that near the spring, a village path runs towards
village Ghwargay Lajbok. She stated that no road
passes over the spring rather there is a road at a certain
distance. Coming to the specific detail of the incident,
she deposed that on 27.06.2018, while she was going
to the spring, no one had seen her. She replied
affirmatively that she did not provide the earthen pot to
the police. She also affirmatively replied that when the
appellant touched her hand (meaning the appellant
took hold of her) she made hue and cry. She added of
her own that the appellant had a pistol and threatened
her to kill her. She admitted that she did not disclose
the factum of pistol and her threat of life to her family
members and to the police. Sixth, regarding her
resistance, she stated that she did not bite the appellant

with her teeth or injured him with her nails.

15. The victim further deposed that her
clothes were not torn but got blood stained. She did not
disclose the factum of blood-stained clothes to her
mother. She explained on her own that she had washed
those clothes. She had gone to the spring at 09:00/
09:30 a.m., and returned around 10:00 a.m. Regarding
the spot position, she told to the Court during her

cross-examination that there was some mud, bushes

Mushtag Akrnad!* (0.5) HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID 1OPAL
-13-

and a little bit leaves there and that a bit of blood was
dropped on the leaves. While pinpointing the place of
the occurrence to the police, she had indicated the earth
and the leaves. She did not disclose to the police that
the next time she went to the spring at 07:00/08:00,
a.m. The next time Younas, her younger brother, aged
about five years accompanied her which fact was also
she did not disclose to the police. She expressed her
lack of knowledge that her maternal uncle had
suspected illicit relationship between his wife and her
father, due to which her father has gone to Saudi
Arabia. She denied a suggestion that there is enmity
between the family of appellant and her uncle due to
which she had implicated the appellant in the instant
case. No suggestion was put to her that the incident did
not take place at all. There was also no suggestion as to

identification and recognition of the appellant.

16. Lady Dr. Hina Zia was examined as
PW-2 on 10.10.2018 before the remand and cross
examined as APW-2 on 03.02.2021, after remand. In
her pre-remand statement, she reproduced her replies
to the questions the I.O asked from her while

examining the victim on 01.07.2018 at 05:15 p.m. For

Yes. Sexual-assault has been done.

3. There is no sign of violence around

17. While under  cross-examination on
10.10.2020, she admitted that in case of rape, the
victim feels severe pain in her private parts. She also
adinitted that hymen could be broken due to severe
blood but she explained that it never breaks due to
bleeding during menstruation period. She further
admitted that in her report there is no mention that
since what time her hymen was not intact. She
explained on her own that usually there is a recovery of
hurt injury from 4 to 10 days. While under cross-
examination after remand, she was asked several
questions most particularly regarding her observation

in her report that there was no bleeding, no sign of

Multey Aimed?” (01) HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE Dy, KMURSHID JOBAL
-15-

violence and that hymen was perforated but it was an
old case (chronic). In reply to a question regarding
violence marks, she deposed that there was no
abrasion, scars bruises, lacerations, scratches and no
complaint of pain by the victim, including no
symptoms of violence, on her clothes. She explained of
her own that there were such signs but the same were
older and it was an older sexual assault case. Her
explanation clearly establishes that the victim was
subjected to sexual intercourse three days before the
report. It was after three days and that, too, when she
saw the appellant again at the place of the occurrence
that she apprehended another sexual assault on her that
she rushed back to her house and disclosed the
incident. As we have seen above, the defence remained
unsuccessful to shatter the testimony of the victim,
inasmuch as she was subjected to rape much before the

incident in question.

18, The lady Dr. Hina Zia was specifically
asked about the word “chronic” she used in
her medical report. She explained that the words
chronic and acute are used when there is a
long disease, for example, chronic diabetic and

chronic asthmatic, etc. She then explained that if

Harktaq Akmed!* (0.8) HON'BLE MRJUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Br. KHURSHID JOBAL
-16-

hymen has ruptured as a result of a sexual violence, it
heals from seven to ten days and even from 4 to 10
days. She further explained that a ruptured hymen as a
result of sexual violence causes severe pain to the
victim including bleeding. She, however, denied that if
the hymen is ruptured for the first time, severe pain

and bleeding, is a must.

19, We shall now advert to the forensic
report. The four parcels containing suspected multiple
colour shirt and suspected green colour shalwar of the
victim, one suspected Swab of the victim, one
suspected white shirt and shalwar of the appellant and
one bottle containing semen were subjected to
chemical examination in the FSL. The parcel No.3
containing the white shirt and one shalwar from the
appellant were found positive for semen. No semen
was detected on the articles contained in other parcels.
Forensic evidence has lost its value. The reason
obviously is that the report was made after three days.

So, we will not believe the FSL report.

20. Regarding site plan Ex PB, the victim and
the I.0 were cross-examined. The evidence
demonstrates that there are no houses or road near

around the spring where the incident took place; thick

Murhteq Akmed!* (0.5) HON'BLE MRIUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
ON! ul
-17-

bushes near the water spring; a path at an elevate
position passing above the spring; a path leading to the
water spring; and road at a certain distance. Evidence
also shows that at the time of spot inspection, blood-

stained leaves and/or earth were not found. .

21. The contention of the defence that there is
a delay of three days in lodging the report is correct.
However, there could be no escaping from the fact that
in such like cases, people avoid to make report as the
honor of the family and the larger-than-life stigma on
the victim, always come in the way of the complainant
party. In case of a woman particularly, unmarried girl,
disclosure of such unfortunate incident is not merely
due to shame and modesty but also due to fear. Such
cases are not ordinarily prompted by false implication.
So far as availability of water supply connection in the
house of the complainant is concerned, it is very usual
and also customary that in such mountainous areas,
like district Dir, people go to the water springs to fetch
clean and cold water for their daily use. As regards the
village road/path, even if it is assumed that there is one
such road/path, it is categorically established that the
appellant took the victim to the nearby thick bushes

and achieved his fiendish goal there. There is no

Hushteg Abed!” {0.5} HON'BLE MA.IUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-18-

possibility, not even a cross question to the effect, that
the place of the occurrence inside the thick bushes was ©
visible from the alleged path/road. Then, the victim has
categorically denied enmity between her uncle and the

appellant.

22. So far the juvenility of the victim is
concemed, if it is assumed that she was admitted into
school at 7, and she left her school at 5, her age would
come out as 12 years. If her age is considered 12 years
on 25.40.2018, the date on which her statement was
recorded before the trial Court prior to remand and her
contention that she brought out from school three years
ago, her age approximately would be 14-1/2 years. As
against this the lady doctor on the basis of her
observation determined her age as 11/12 years. Even if
it is admitted that she was 17, as the trial Court has
opined, she was still under 18. As to the compromise,
when she was asked about it, she replied in affirmative
but as, the learned trial Judge has observed, her reply
came after a long pause and silence. We have already
discussed about the word “old chronic” used in the
medical report suggests to the actual incident and no
inference of bad character of the victim could be drawn

from it. Needless to say, the appellant was also

q MM AD NAEE!
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID LOBAL

offre Ww fe

asyy

-19-

medically examined, he was found having attained
puberty and capable of performance sexual intercourse.
The non-recovery of blood-stained earth and leaves is
also of no help to the appellant for the simple reason
that the occurrence took place three days before the
report and there was no possibility that suchlike

evidence would remain intact.

23. As sequel to above we have reached to the
conclusion that the prosecution has successfully proved
the charge leveled against the appellant. Thus, we
uphold the conviction and sentence passed against the
appellant vide the impugned judgment dated
16.09.2021. Resultantly, the instant appeal, being

devoid of any merit, is hereby dismissed.
