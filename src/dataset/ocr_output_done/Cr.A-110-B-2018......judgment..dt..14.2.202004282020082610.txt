2. Facts of the case, as reflected from the FIR
Ex. PA, are that on 19.02.1987 at 1715 hours, complainant
Pathan Faqir brought the dead bodies of his nephew Ghazi
Khan and a guest Moeen Khan to police station Miryan,
Bannu and made report to the police to the effect that on the
eventful day at Peshin Vela, he was sitting in front of his
house, whereas the above named persons who had come as
guests were sitting near their tents, meanwhile, convicted
co-accused Aziz Khan, armed with 303 bore rifle, while the
appellant armed with Kalashnikov, came towards Ghazi
Khan and Moeen Khan, some altercation took place
between them during course of which both the accused
started firing, resultantly, Ghazi Khan and Moeen Khan
were hit and fell on the ground; that when he attended them
they had succumbed to their injuries. After the occurrence,
the accused decamped from the spot. Besides the
complainant, the occurrence was stated to be witnessed by
Hakim Khan. Motive for the offence was that both the
accused had been forbidden by the deceased not to come to
their tents for disturbing ‘Parda’ of the ladies. He charged
the accused for the commission of offence.

3. Initially, co-accused Aziz Khan was arrested
and tried by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu,
who was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced to death on two counts. He was also sentenced to

pay compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of each
-3-

of the deceased in terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. vide
judgment dated 25.6.2011, whereas the appellant was
declared proclaimed offender, however, convicted co-
accused Aziz Khan escaped from Central Prison, Bannu
and his appeal against the conviction and sentence pending
before this Court was adjourned sine die.

4. After arrest of the appellant and completion
of investigation, supplementary challan was submitted
against him to learned Trial Court. Accused was charged
for the offence to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. During course of trial, PWs Hakim Khan, Mst.
Zangeera, Banochi Khan, Abdul Wahid, Dr. Muhammad
Jamil and Said Akbar Khan Investigating Officer were
found dead, therefore, their statements recorded during
proceedings under Section 512, Cr.P.C. were transferred to
the trial of appellant, besides the prosecution examined Said
Ayaz Khan SHO as PW-1, who arrested the accused on
18.8.2017 and submitted supplementary challan, whereas
Munawar Khan appeared as PW-2, who escorted the dead
bodies of both the deceased to the hospital from police
station Miryan and after postmortem examination, the
doctor handed over to him blood stained garments of both
the deceased which he had taken to the Investigation
Officer to the spot. After closure of prosecution evidence,
the accused was examined under section 342, Cr.P.C.,

wherein he denied the allegations, professed innocence and

-4-

false implication, however, neither he opted to be examined
under Section 340(2), Cr.P.C., nor produced evidence in his
defence. After conclusion of the trial, the learned trial Court
vide impugned judgment dated 06.6.2018, convicted the
accused and sentenced him as mentioned above, which has
been impugned by the appellant through the present appeal,
whereas the State through Advocate General Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa_ has filed Cr.R. No.43-B/2018, for
enhancement of sentence awarded to the appellant.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. It is the case of prosecution that on the
eventful day at Peshin Vela, the complainant was sitting in
front of his house, whereas the deceased Ghazi son of
Habib (nephew) (2) Moeen son of Khan, where the
deceased Moeen had come as a guest to the deceased Ghazi
and were sitting in the open space between the tents, where
in the meanwhile, convicted co-accused Aziz Khan, armed
with 303 bore rifle, while the appellant armed with
Kalashnikov, came towards Ghazi Khan and Moeen Khan,
some altercation took place between them during course of
which both the accused started firing, resultantly, Ghazi
Khan and Moeen Khan were hit and fell on the ground and
succumbed to their injuries on the spot. Since the
complainant Pathan Faqir was dead prior to the trial of
convicted co-accused, so he was abandoned by the

prosecution, whereas Mst. Zangeera and PW Hakim were

-5-

produced in the previous trial against the co-accused and
their statements were recorded. The learned counsel for the
appellant went on to say that there was no attempt on part
of the prosecution to procure the attendance of the
witnesses and that the transposition of the statements
recorded in the previous trial was motivated with malice
and mala fide. There is no denial to the fact that the law has
provided a mechanism for transposition of the statements
recorded earlier if the witnesses were either dead or could
not be found. Two provisions of law are worth mentioning
for the purpose i.e. Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, and Section 512 of the Cr.P.C. Article 47
reads as “Evidence given by a witness in a judicial
proceeding, or before any person authorised by law to take
it, is relevant for the purpose of proving in a subsequent
judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial
proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the
witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of given
evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or
if his presence cannot be obtained without any amount of
delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the
case, the Court considers unreasonable”. This is on record
that the occurrence took place on 19.02.1987, whereas the
matter was reported on the same date, but both the accused
remained absconders. The co-accused Aziz Khan was

earlier arrested and faced the trial when nearly all the

-6-

prosecution witnesses including Mst. Zangeera and Hakim
Khan were examined and on conclusion of the trial, the trial
Court vide judgment dated 25.6.2011, convicted the
accused under section 302(b) PPC to death as Ta’zir on two
counts and to pay fine of Rs.2,00,000/- to the legal heirs of
the deceased in terms of Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. To repel
the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant, it 1s
needed to mention that soon after the occurrence, the
appellant absconded and was never heard of for long thirty
years and it was on 17.8.2017, the accused was arrested. It
needs reiteration that some of the witnesses examined in the
previous trial were either dead or could not be found, we
feel no hesitation to say that it was the prerogative of the
trial Court to transpose the earlier recorded statements of
the witnesses after observing the legal formalities and the
same was done. The contentions of the learned counsel for
the defence that Mst. Zangeera Bibi did not find mention in
the FIR and that the other prosecution witness namely
Hakim Khan was not present and attracted to the crime
scene by the time when the firing had already been made
and the accused were running there-from and he stressed
that the testimony of these witnesses cannot be taken for
conviction against the appellant. We are conscious of the
fact that the incident occurred at a place where the
complainant with some of his relative were living in tents,

as they had come from another area, it is a common
-7-

practice in these people that they usually keep sticking to
their tents being alien in the area and as such, the presence
of Mst. Zangeera Bibi and PW Hakim Khan cannot be
doubted. Soon after the occurrence, the dead bodies were
taken to the police station without loss of time, where the
report was made and this quick succession of events
excludes the possibility of consultation and deliberations.
7. The defence failed to establish that the charge
against the appellant was the outcome of malice and ulterior
motives as it transpires from record that the accused and
complainant were not related to each other and as such, had
no common interest. The motive given in the FIR appeals to
mind that these were the accused who had come to tease the
women folk and in such eventuality altercation took place
which yielded the occurrence. The overall circumstances of
the case tell nothing but bona fide on part of the prosecution
that they told what they saw.

In case titled Imtiaz Ali_alias Taji Vs. The

State & others (2020 SCMR 287), it was held that:

The ocular account in this case was
furnished by Tariq Ejaz (PW-10) and Meer
Tahir (PW-11). Tariq Ejaz (PW-10) is the
complainant of the case and is the real son
of deceased Ejaz Ahmad. He has given
sufficient explanation for his presence at
the spot at the relevant time. Meer Tahir
son of Noor Muhammad (PW-11) used to
work at General Bus Stand and sustained
fire-arm injuries during the occurrence.
Both these witnesses by and large remained
consistent on all the material aspects of the
case and held the appellant responsible for
fire-arm injury on the abdomen of Ejaz
-8-

Ahmad (deceased). Their statements get
support, from the medical evidence”.

8. In order to scrutinize the discrepancy, if any,
was minor or not or the same amounted to contradiction,
regard is required to the facts and circumstances of each
case, keeping in view the social status of the witnesses and
environment in which such witness was making the
statement. In the depositions of witnesses there are always
normal discrepancies, however, honest and truthful they
may be. Such discrepancies are due to normal errors of
observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time
etc. Material discrepancies are those which are not normal
and not expected of a normal person. The Hon’ble Supreme

Court of Pakistan in case titled “Allah Bakhsh Vs Ahmad

Din (1971 SCMR 462), observed that minor discrepancies
in deposition of prosecution witnesses of inconsequential
nature cannot reasonably be considered as good grounds in
disbelieving independent and disinterested witnesses. If
importance be given to such insignificant inconsistencies
there can hardly be any conviction, for seldom is there a
witness whose evidence does not suffer from such
inconsistencies.

9. No doubt, mere absconsion is not a
conclusive proof of guilt of accused person, but it can be
used as a corroborative piece of evidence and has to be read
along with substantive piece of evidence. While going

through the record, it appears that after commission of the

-9-

offence, the accused remained fugitive from law for more
than thirty (30) years and no explanation whatsoever was
given for his long abscondence. It is evident from the
record that all efforts were made to arrest the accused, but
the law enforcing agencies could not succeed and even the
concerned Court issued the process against the appellant
but it was after long thirty years when the accused was
arrested to face the charges.

In case titled Bux Ali alias Dodo Vs. The

State (2019 YLR 324 [Sindh, Hyderabad Bench), it was
held that:
Appellant did not join investigation, his
abscondence for pretty longtime was
unexplained and was additional piece of
evidence against him.
10. The learned State counsel at the tail end
requested for enhancement of sentence by accepting Cr.R.
No.43-B/2018, and stated that when the prosecution proves
its case, then the normal penalty is nothing but the sentence
of death, however, we do not find ourselves in agreement
with the learned State counsel, as the prosecution badly
failed to establish the motive against the accused and no
evidence was collected by the Investigating Officer in that
respect. The law is settled that once the motive is alleged
and is not proved, it reacts upon the quantum of sentence.
11. After evaluating the evidence on file, this
Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the

prosecution has proved its case against the accused to the
-10-

hilt and that the impugned judgment is well-reasoned in all
respects which needs no interference. Resultantly, this
criminal appeal alongwith Cr.R. No.43-B/2018, stand

dismissed.
