co-accused Gohar Rehman alias Bacha and
Criminal Revision No.133-P/2015 — by
complainant Mst. Nihar Begum widow of
deceased Inam Khan for enhancement of

sentence awarded to accused/respondent
No.1, Shah Room, by the learned trial Court
vide impugned judgment dated 18.06.2013,
as both the appeals by the convict-appellants
and the revision petition relate to the same
case vide FIR No.506 dated 30.05.2010 under
Sections 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station

Katlang, Mardan.

2. The report/FIR in the case was lodged
by Mst. Nihar Begum, complainant, in Police
Station Katlang, District Mardan, where she
had brought the dead body of her deceased
husband Inam Khan son of Daulat Khan in a
datson with the help of her co-villagers, and
lodged report to the effect that on the eventful
day i.e.30.05.2010 she along with her
deceased husband Inam Khan, her son, Bakht
Munir, and brother in law, Behram Khan, had
gone to Katlang Bazar for purchasing clothes
and while on their way back to their home,
Abdur Rehman son of Gul Rehman, Gohar
Rehman alias Bacha and Shah Room sons of
Abdur Rehman residents of Babozai Katlang

suddenly emerged on the scene and opened
fire at them with their deadly weapons,
resulting in the Qatl-i-Amd of deceased Inam
Khan. They, however, escaped unhurt. The
motive for the occurrence was mentioned as
dispute over women folk, and Bakht Munir as
well as Behram Khan were cited as eye
witnesses. After registration of the case/FIR,
the dead body of the deceased was referred
to RHC Katlang, where autopsy was
conducted; and the Medical Officer (PW-3)
found the following firearms injuries with
corresponding exit wounds;

I. F.A entry wound on lower end of
sternum 1 x 1 mm in diameter with its
exit wound below right axilla 2 x 2 mm.
Il. F.A entry wound on _ieft
hypochondrium 1 x 1 mm, while its exit
on back side lateral to vertebral
column right side in lumber area 2 x 2
mm.

lll. FA entry wound on back side
vertebral column lumber area 1.5 x 1.5
mm in size while its exit right side

below axilla 2 x 2 mm in size.
In the opinion of the Medical Officer,
cause of death was firearm injury to vital
organs like lungs, heart and spinal card. The
time between injury and death was shown as
approximately one hour while time between
death and P.M was approximately two hours.
Investigation in the case was entrusted to
Amir Bacha SI (PW.5), who proceeded to the
spot, inspected the spot, and during spot
inspection not only secured blood from the
place assigned to the deceased in the site
plan but also one empty shell of 30 bore. The
blood stained carton secured from the spot
and blood stained garments of the deceased
received from the hospital after autopsy were
sent to the FSL Peshawar and a positive

report was received there-from.

3. Initially, all the three accused named in
the FIR were absconding and were therefore
proceeded against under Sections 204 and 87
Cr.P.C, and challan was submitted against
them under Section 512 Cr.P.C; but after

surrender of co-accused and father of the
convict/appellants, namely, Abdur Rehman,
on 09.11.2011, supplementary challan was
submitted against him, leading to his trial,
resulting in his acquittal of the charges vide
judgment/order of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-lll, . Mardan, dated
17.04.2012; whereas the convict/appellants,
still remaining at large were declared
proclaimed offenders and perpetual NBW of
arrest were issued against them vide the
same judgment dated 17.04.2012.

4. Convict/appellant, Shah Room, also
surrendered before the police and was
arrested on 01.11.2012. After receipt of
supplementary challan against him, he was
formally charged in the case under Sections
302/324/34 PPC, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its
case against the convict/appellant, Shah
Room, the prosecution produced as many
asii1 PWs and closed its evidence; where-
after statement of the accused was recorded

under Section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he refuted
allegation of the prosecution but declined to
be examined on oath or produce defence
evidence. Having heard arguments of learned
SPP on behalf of the State assisted by private
counsel for the complainant and learned
counsel for the accused, the learned trial
Court/ASJ-III, Mardan, convicted and
sentenced appellant, Shah Room, to
imprisonment for life as Tazir with
compensation of Rs.300000/- payable to legal
heirs of deceased Inam Khan son of Daulat
Khan within the meaning of Section 544-A
Cr.P.C or in default to one year S.I, with
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C_ vide
impugned judgment dated 18.06.2013; hence
the instant appeal by the convict/appellant,
Shah Room.

5. Convict/appellant, _Gohar Rehman
alias Bacha, was arrested on 02.01.2015, and
was tried in the Court of learned ASJ-III,
Mardan, after submission of supplementary
challan against him and framing of formal

charge by the learned trial Court. This time,
the prosecution examined a total of 8 PWs
and closed its evidence, followed by
statement of the accused/appellant under
Section 342 Cr.P.C. He disputed allegations
of the prosecution, but declined to be
examined on oath or produce defence
evidence. Having heard the learned Deputy
DPP assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant and learned counsel for the
accused/appellant, Gohar Rehman alias
Bacha was also convicted under Section 302
(b) PPC and sentenced to life imprisonment
as ‘Tazir with fine of Rs.200000/- or in default
to suffer further six months S.I, with further
direction to the appellant/accused to pay
compensation of Rs.400000/- to the legal
heirs of deceased Inam Khan within the
meaning of Section 544-A Cr.P.C, which shall
be recoverable as arrears of land revenue if
not paid to the legal heirs of the deceased,
along with benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C to
accused/appellant, vide impugned judgment

of the learned trial Court/ASJ-IIl, Mardan,
dated 02.12.2015; which is also impugned
through a separate connected Criminal
Appeal No.728-P/2015.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict/appellants and learned AAG assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant heard;
and record perused.

7. No doubt, the report/FIR was lodged in
the P.S within 45 minutes of the occurrence,
as the occurrence, allegedly, took place at
1745 hours on 30.05.2010 while report was
lodged on the same day at 1830 hours; and all
the three accused were charged by name in
the report of complainant and widow of
deceased Inam Khan for the gatl-i-amd of her
deceased husband by effectively firing at him,
while citing dispute over women folk as motive
for the offence; but the complainant and both
the eye witnesses i.e. son of the complainant,
Bakht Munir and her brother in law, Behram
Khan, escaped unhurt, and did not receive a
single fire arm injury in the firing attributed to

all the three accused named in the FIR and
belonging to the same family, acquitted
accused Abdur Rehman father and convict/
appellants Shah Room and Gohar Rehman
his sons. The motive for the commission of
the offence also remained shrouded in
mystery, and was not proved independently.
Moreover, despite charge of gatl-i-amd of
deceased against three persons, only one
empty shell of 30 bore was recovered from the
spot, and PM report showed two entry wounds
of the same size i.e. 1 x 1 mm while third entry
wound of different size of 1.5 x 1.5 mm and
that, too, on the back side, unlike the first two
firearm entry wounds on the front side of body
of the deceased, thus creating doubt about
the site plan showing all the three accused in
the same direction from the deceased. The
FIR showed instantaneous death of the
deceased, but the PM report revealed time
between injury and death, approximately, one
hour and time between death and P.M
examination, approximately, two hours, thus

casting serious doubt about version of the
prosecution, on the one hand, and credibility
of the complainant and eye witnesses, on the
other.

8. Apart from non-production of clothes,
allegedly, purchased before the occurrence by
the complainant and the eye witnesses, being
chance witnesses, contradictions in the
statement of the complainant, Mst. Nihar
Begum (PW-4), with regard to signing of her
report by the PWs accompanying her and the
deceased to the hospital, and non citing of
the complainant and the so-called eye
witnesses as identifiers of the dead body in
both the inquest report prepared by the police
as well as PM report of the Medical Officer,
creating doubt about presence of the
complainant and the so-called eye witnesses
on the spot at the relevant time, the acquittal
of co-accused and father of convict/appellants
Abdur Rehman, facing similar charges and
attributed identical role in the case, and non
filing of appeal against his acquittal either by

the complainant or by the State, and thus the
acquittal order in the same case on the basis
of the same evidence, particularly that of the
complainant and the so-called eye witness
Behram Khan, left case of the prosecution
bereft of any incriminating evidence against
the appellants; hence providing no justification
for their conviction and award of sentence of
life imprisonment to both the appellants vide
separate judgments of the learned trial Court.
Needless to say that in the given
circumstances, even abscondence of the
accused/appellants for a considerable period,
being only a corroborative piece of evidence
and not a substitute for substantive evidence
could not justify conviction of the appellants in
the face of otherwise weak case of the
prosecution which was_ replete with doubts
and contradictions.

9. Consequently, both the instant appeal
as well as the connected appeal by appellant,
Gohar Rehman, are accepted; and while
setting aside the impugned judgments as well

as conviction and sentences awarded to the
both the accused/appellants, they are
acquitted of the charges levelled against them
and be set free, forthwith, if not required in
any other case.

10. Following acceptance of the
appeals of both the accused/appellants and
setting aside their convictions and sentences
awarded to them, the criminal revision
No.133-P/2015 by complainant, Mst. Nihar
Begum, having become _infructuous, is
disposed of, accordingly.

Announced.
