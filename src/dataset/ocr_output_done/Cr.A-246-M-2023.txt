JUDGMENT
SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through the subject

criminal appeal, the appellant has challenged
the order/judgment of his conviction & sentence
passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-IIl/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court!
Dir Upper, dated 26.07.2023, in respect of case
FIR No. 85 dated, 16.04.2022, U/Ss 324/337-D
PPC, R/W Section 15-AA, P.S, Dir City,

District Dir Upper.

2. Reportedly, the injured/
complainant, Amir Rahman in the company of
other injured, Mst. Subhania Bibi reported the
subject event to the local police at emergency
ward of Dir hospital in terms that some time

ago his nephew, Ali (the accused/appellant

‘Nawab (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-2-

herein) had leveled certain allegations of theft
against his children and the said matter was
patched up between the parties about six
months back due to intervention of the elders of
the locality. On the fateful day, date & time, his
sons, Noor Jamal & Bacha Muhammad were
busy in altercation with each other, in the
meanwhile, the accused/appellant, Ali, entered
in their house, while being duly armed with
pistol and started firing at the complainant-
party. Due to firing of the accused/appellant,
the complainant got injured on left side of his
rib, whereas, her daughter-in-law (52), Mst.
Subhania sustained injury on left side of her
chest. In addition to both the aforesaid injured,
the occurrence was claimed to have been
witnessed by Bacha Muhammad and Noor
Jamal, sons of the complainant. Motive for the
commission of offence was stated to be
previous ill-will between the parties over
leveling of allegations of theft. The event was
reduced into in writing in the shape of
‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-11/4) followed by the ibid
FIR (Ex. PW-4/1) registered against the
accused/appellant at P.S concerned.

3. Upon arrest of the accused/
appellant followed by completion of the
investigation, challan was drawn and was sent-
up for trial to the learned trial Court. Accused
was confronted with the statement of
allegations through a formal charge-sheet to

which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. To substantiate the guilt of the
accused/appellant, the prosecution furnished its
account consist of the statements of fourteen
(14) witnesses. The accused was confronted
with the evidence so furnished through
statement of accused within the meaning of

section 342 Cr.P.C.

5. On conclusion of proceedings in
the trial, in view of the evidence so recorded
and the assistance so rendered by the learned
counsel for the accused/appellant and the
learned counsel for the complainant/learned
State counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at
the conclusion that the prosecution has
successfully brought home charge against the

appellant/accused, Ali Rahman, through cogent

Nawab (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

& worth reliable evidence, as such, he was

approach this Court through the subject

criminal appeal.

7.

Learned counsel for the parties

as well as the learned Astt: A.G have been

heard at a length and the record gone through

with their valuable assistance.

Nawab ($.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-5-
8. The record so furnished would

divulge that the accused/appellant, Ali
Rehman has been facing the allegations of
murderous attempt made at the lives of the
injured/complainant, Amir Rahman and the
other injured Mst. Subhania Bibi. It is also
part of the record that the fire shots of the
accused/appellant has achieved its target as
both the injured have stamp of injuries on
different parts of their bodies, however, the
only question before the Court for
determination would be as to it was the act of
the accused/appellant or otherwise which is to
be thrashed out in the light of ocular-account
furnished by the complainant-party, including

the two injured PWs.

9, The injured/complainant, Amir
Rahman on his own turn appeared in the
witness-box as PW-8. In his examination-in-
chief, he almost reiterated the same facts as
advanced in the ‘Murasila’ followed by the
ibid FIR, however, his examination-in-cross is
worth perusal. In his examination-in-cross, he

deposed as under;-

Nawab (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-6-
AS te LCi ed eh ut
ZF Hol WHOL

In view of the aforesaid
admissions of nobody else but the injured/
complainant himself, it is crystal clear that he
has shown complete ignorance about the
number of shots made by the accused/
appellant at the relevant time. This fact has
relevancy in the context of the subject event
in terms that it is not a case of single injured
rather as per prosecution’s case firing of the
accused allegedly proved effective qua
causing firearm injuries to the two injured,
therefore, the complainant must have
knowledge about the number of fire shots
made by the accused. In the same breath, the
complainant also admitted in his  cross-
examination that he has no idea that how
many empties were recovered from the spot as
at the time of pointation of spot to the
Investigation Officer both the injured were
not present on the spot. He also deposed in his
cross-examination that at the relevant both of

his sons were quarrelling with each other.

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-7-

Here the question arises that if both the sons
of the complainant were busy in altercation
with each other and that too inside the
premises of their house then why and for what
reason a need arises for accused/appellant to
indulge in the private matter of two brothers,
therefore, the very mode & manner of the
occurrence is not appealable to a prudent
mind qua the very presence of the accused/
appellant on the spot. This matter further
complicated in terms that when the other
injured, Mst. Subhania appeared in the Court
as PW-9, she also deposed in alike manner
that she has no knowledge that how many fire
shots have been fired by the accused/appellant,
however, she & her father-in-law i.e. the
complainant received injuries of their bodies.
In response to a specific question put-forward
by the learned counsel for the defence, she

made the following admissions;-

ew 24a Hiden se

In view of the above narration of

the injured PW, Mst. Subhania the whole case

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-8-

of the prosecution poles apart in terms that
how it is possible that single bullet allegedly hit
the injured at first instance and then make its
way to the body of the injured/complainant,
therefore, this element prima facie not only
cast a serious doubt about the mode & manner
of the occurrence but it also overshadow the
present of the accused/appellant at the venue
of crime. The other alleged eyewitness of the
occurrence i.e. Noor Jamal, the son of the
complainant appeared in the Court as PW-10.
In his cross-examination he has also shown
complete ignorance about the number of shots
fired by the accused/appellant at the relevant
time with further addition that he could not
say as to whether both the injured sustained
injuries as a result of one single bullet shot or
otherwise, as at the relevant time he was
standing near the gate. He also admitted that
at the time of spot inspection the police have
only recovered one crime empty. Thus, the
presence of the alleged eyewitnesses at the
relevant time & place appears to be highly

unreasonable and unnatural and thus the

font

-9-

prosecution has not been able to prove the
presence of these PWs at the scene of
occurrence at the relevant time, hence, their
evidence has wrongly been taken into
consideration by the learned trial Court for the
purpose of conviction of the accused/

appellant. In a situation, akin to the present

one, in case titled “Sarfaraz & another v/s

The State” reported as 2023 SCMR 670, the

Apex Court has held as under;-

Not a single person from the inmates of the house
where occurrence took place or from surrounding
inhabitants appeared in support of the prosecution
version and the whole prosecution case was silent
about this aspect of the matter. Record clearly
reflected that the prosecution witnesses were not
present at the place of occurrence, rather they
managed to appear as witnesses after due
consultation and deliberation. Record further
showed that the complainant was inimical towards
the deceased. In such circumstances, it seemed
impossible that deceased would have invited an
inimical person for his help before his death.
Prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond
any reasonable shadow of doubt

Similarly, in case titled “Liagat

Ali_and another v/s The State and others”

reported as 2021 SCMR 780, the Apex Court

has recorded a somewhat similar observations by

holding that;-

All the tircumstances highlighted above lead us to
a definite conclusion that presence of eye-witnesses
at the place of occurrence at the relevant time is
not free from doubts and the prosecution has

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
se

-10-

failed to prove its case against the appellant
beyond reasonable doubt.

In case titled “Muhammad Arif

Vs. The State” reported as 2019 SCMR 631,

the Hon’ble Supreme Court observed
regarding the effect of  dis-honest
improvements by a witness and observed as

under:-

It is well established by now that when a witness
improves his statement and moment it is observed
that the said improvement was made dishonestly
to strengthen the prosecution, such portion of his
statement is to be discarded out of consideration.
Having observed the improvements in the
statements of both the witnesses of ocular account,
we hold that it is not safe to rely on their testimony
to maintain conviction and _ sentence of
Muhammad Arif (appellant) on a capital charge.

Even if the accounts of these
material witnesses are put in juxtaposition with
their improvements, as referred to above, then
the same make case of prosecution a case of no
evidence. In this respect, reliance is placed on
the judgment of Hon’ble Federal Shariat Court

rendered in case titled “Nadeem and others v/s

The State and others” reported as 2014 P Cr.

LJ 374 wherein it has been held;-

“Thus it is clear from the above that there are two
versions made by the P.Ws. themselves and both
these versions are self-contradictory. Obviously
two contradictory statements about the same
occurrence cannot be considered truthful.
Therefore, a genuine doubt has arisen about these
P.Ws., who blew hot and cold in the same breath
and showed least respect for telling the truth and,
by being capable of changing their versions as and

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-ll-

when it suited them, proved that they are worthy
of no credence even if they are natural witnesses of
the occurrence. If a witness deposes falsely under
threat and that too on oath inside a court, on one
occasion, how can he or she be relied upon and
believed as truthful on another occasion. This
mercurial behavior reflected from their conflicting
depositions lends, in a way, support to the defence
plea that Inayat complainant and Mst. Fouzia who
had been residing at Agriculture Farm of Arif
Badrana for the last so many years had implicated
all the accused at his instance.”

10. It is part of the record that the
other alleged eyewitness of the occurrence,
Bacha Muhammad was not produced by the
prosecution in support of their case and was
abandoned, as such, he, being an important
witness of the prosecution would have been in
a better position to clearly identify with
perfection the accused/appellant, but he was
abandoned and thus the prosecution in all
eventualities has withheld the best available
evidence, therefore, under Article 129 (g), the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 an adverse
inference has to be drawn that had the said
PW been produced he would have not
supported the case of prosecution. The Apex
Court in case titled “Lal Khan v/s State”

reported as 2006 SCMR 1846 has held that;-

A material witness of occurrence would create an
impression that had such witness been brought
into witness-box, he might not have supported the

Nawab (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-12-

prosecution and in such eventuality the
prosecution must not be in a position to avoid
consequence,

Similarly, in case titled

“Mandoos Khan v/s The State” reported as

2003 SCMR 884 it was observed by the Apex

Court that;-

Prosecufion must produce best kind of evidence to
establish accusation against accused facing trial
but simultaneously it has no obligation to produce
a good number of witnesses because it has an
option to produce as many as witnesses which in
its consideration are sufficient to bring home guilt
against the accused, following the principle of law
that to establish accusation, indeed it is not the
quantity but quality of the evidence, which gets
preference.

11. The prosecution has not been able
to bring on record any confidence inspiring
ocular evidence which could connect the
accused/appellant with the alleged attempt made
at the lives of the complainant-party nor there is
any sort of circumstantial evidence against the
accused in the field except the recovery of
weapon of offence i.e. a 30 bore pistol,
allegedly recovered on the pointation of the
accused/appellant vide recovery memo, Ex.
PW-2/2. The marginal witness to the aforesaid
recovery memo, Shaukat Ali, constable , PW-02
has stated in his examination-in-cross that the
alleged place of recovery i.e. house was

comprising of six rooms, however, the alleged

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-13-

recovery of weapon of offence has been made
from the Baitak/Guest House, therefore, in all
eventualities, the place of recovery is not an
abandoned place rather comprising of
residential rooms, as such, this element alone
makes the very recovery of weapon of offence
doubtful, therefore, the alleged recovery of
weapon of offence qua the guilt of the
accused/appellant has wrongly been believed by
the learned trial Court through the impugned
order/judgment qua conviction of the accused/
appellant. Even otherwise, when substantive
evidence fails to connect the accused person
with the commission of offence or is
disbelieved, corroborative evidence is of no
help to the prosecution as the corroborative
evidence cannot by itself prove the
prosecution’s case. Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan while giving its judgment in case titled

“Muhammad Afzal alias Abdullah and others
vs. The State_and_ others” reported as 2009
SCMR 639 has also expressed almost a similar
view in para-12 of its judgment, which is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

‘Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-14-

“After taking out from consideration the ocular
evidence, the evidence of identification and the
medical evidence, we are left with the evidence of
recoveries only, which being purely corroboratory
in nature, in our view, alone is not capable to bring
home charge against the appellant in the absence
of any direct evidence because it is well-settled that
unless direct or substantive evidence is available
conviction cannot be recorded on the basis of any
other type of evidence howsoever, convincing it
may be.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in its judgment rendered in case titled
“Imran Ashraf _& 7 others v/s The State”
reported as 2001 SCMR 424, has also observed;
“Recovery of incriminating articles is used for
the purpose of providing corroboration to the
ocular testimony. Ocular evidence and
recoveries, therefore, are to be considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a just
conclusion."

In support of same ratio, further
reliance may also be placed on the judgment
reported as 2007 SCMR 1427.

12. As far as the medical evidence is
concerned, needless to highlight that the
medical evidence may confirm the direct or
ocular account, if any, with regard to the set of
injuries, kind of weapon allegedly used in the
commission of offence and at least the nature
of injuries, however, in the subject case when
the occurrence is not confidence inspiring
then evidentiary value of medical evidence
qua the guilt of the accused/appellant as a sole

piece of corroboratory evidence cannot be

Nawab (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-15-

given much weight. Reliance in this regard is
placed on the case titled “Abdul Rashid v/s
The State” reported as 2019 P Cr. LJ 1456,
whereby it has been held that;-

“The medical evidence in this case has been
furnished by PW-4 Dr. Nasreen Ahmad Tareen,
Medical Officer, who has confirmed the unnatural
death of deceased. However, the fact remain that
medical evidence is only used for confirmation of
ocular evidence regarding seat of injury, time of
occurrence and weapon of offence used, etc. but
medical evidence itself does not constitute any
corroboration qua the identity of accused person to
prove their culpability. Reliance in this regard can

be placed on the case of “Muhammad Sharif &
another v/s The State” (1997 SCMR 866).

In context of the case in hand, the
medical evidence has been furnished by Dr.
Rafi Ullah, he appeared in the witness-box as
PW-12. In his examination-in-cross, he stated
that he has not mentioned the specific time of
examination of the injured in his report. He also
stated that he examined the injured on 19:20
hours, however, prepared his reports on
20.05.2022 after receipt of the discharge
summaries therefore, the medical evidence
being not confidence inspiring has wrongly
been given weightage by the learned trial

Court.

13. In view of the above, when

neither any direct nor any circumstantial

Nawab (S.B) Hon"ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
-16-

evidence is available on the face of the record,
as such, the case of prosecution is full of doubt
all-around; therefore, the accused/appellant has
to be extended its benefit.

14. It is well settled, it is not essential
at all to place reliance on multiple doubts
coupled with multiple grounds to extend the
benefit of doubt to an accused, even a single
worth reliable doubt is sufficient enough to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of criminal administration
of justice that let hundred guilty persons be
acquitted but one innocent person should not be
convicted. In the case of “Tarig Pervaiz v/s The
State” reported as 1995 SCMR 1345 , the Apex
Court has held as under;-

That the concept of benefit of doubt to an accused
person is deep-rooted in our country. For giving him
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If there is a
circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of the accused, then the
accused will be entitled to the benefit not as a matter
of grace and concession but as a matter of right.

Further reliance is placed on the

case law cited as “Daniel _boyd (Muslim
name_Saifullah) vs_the State” reported as

1992 SCMR_196”, where the following

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-17-

observations were recorded by the Apex
Court;-

Nobody is to be punished unless proved guilty on
the basis of reliable or true evidence. Benefit of
every reasonable doubt is to go to the accused.

This view also reflects in the

judgment of the apex Court titled as

“Ghulam Qadir and 2 others vs the State”

reported as 2008 SCMR 1221, wherein it
was observed that:-

"Benefit of doubt. Principle of applicability. For
the purpose of benefit of doubt to an accused, more
than one infirmity is not required. Single infirmity
creates reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent person regarding the truth
of charge, makes the whole case doubtful. "

In support of the same rational,
further reliance is placed on the judgment of

the august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

“Muhammad Zaman _vs. the State” (2014
SCMR 749), wherein it was held that;-

Even a single doubt if found reasonable, was
enough to warrant acquittal of the accused.

15. For what has been discussed
above, this Court is of the firm view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against

the accused/ appellant, Ali Rahman beyond

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
of

‘a

Al

x

-18-

reasonable doubt, as such, his conviction
cannot be maintained. Resultantly, while
extending him the benefit of the doubt the
subject criminal appeal is allowed and the
impugned order/judgment of conviction and
sentence dated 26.07.2023 recorded by the
learned trial Court is set aside and
consequently the appellant named above is
acquitted of the charges leveled against him.
He be released forthwith from the Jail, if not

required in any other case.

16. These are reasons for my short

order of even date.
