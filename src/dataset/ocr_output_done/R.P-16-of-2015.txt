2. Essential and relevant facts of the
case are that the present petitioner was
charged by Hazrat Bilal the complainant for
the murder of his brother Liagat Ali on
17.07.2007. The matter was reported to the
local police on the same date and resultantly
the FIR No. 1249 under section 302 PPC was

registered against the present petitioner on

‘17.07.2007 at police station Mingora, District

Swat. The present petitioner was sent to trial
before the learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi
Swat, who on conclusion of trial acquitted the
present petitioner through judgment dated
14.11.2009. The said acquittal of the petitioner
was challenged by the complainant Hazrat
Bilal through criminal appeal No. 600-P of
2009 before this Court. After resorting to all
modes of service, when the present petitioner
could not be traced/turned up the appeal was
decided in his absence vide impugned
judgment dated 03.03.2016 and the petitioner
was convicted as stated above. The petitioner

through the instant review petition wants us to

NAWAB/PS” OB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
set aside the aforesaid conviction recorded by
this Court in its judgment dated 03.03.2016.

3. The learned counsel Mr. Sajjad
Anwar, Advocate while appearing on behalf
of the accused/petitioner has argued that
indeed as evident from record the accused had
abandoned his place of abode and therefore he
could not receive any notice, summon or
warrant of this Court and as such was not
avoiding his presence before the Court, but he
had no knowledge of the proceedings,
therefore, his conviction in absentia is not
only against all norms of justice but is also
contrary to Article 10-A of the Constitution.
In support of his arguments, the learned
counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on

case law cited as “Babar Hussain Shah and
another_vs._Mujeed Ahmed Khan and
another (2012 SCMR_1235), “ Habib-ur-
Rehman vs. The State” (2010 P Cr. LJ 658),
“Mst. Mumtaz Begum and 8 others vs. Shakil
Hyder and 12 others” (1997 P Cr. LJ 776

Karachi), “ Nazak Hussain vs, The State”

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
wi

(PLD 1996 S.C. 178), “ Mohammad Hanif
vs. The State” (PLD 1974 Karachi 22) and
“Gulzar Hassan Shah vs. Ghulam Murtaza
& 4 others” (PLD 1970 Supreme Court 335).

Whereas Mr. Rahim Shah, the learned Astt:
Advocate General appearing on behalf of the
respondents has argued that this Court has no
jurisdiction to review its judgment in terms of
clear bar contained in section 369 of the
Criminal Procedure Code (“Cr.PC”).

4. We have carefully gone through
the record with the valuable assistance of the
learned counsels of the ‘parties, however, the
issue raised by the petitioner cannot be
resolved unless first we determine the
maintainability of the present petition. -
Through judgment dated 03.03.2016 the
petitioner was convicted and the said
judgment of conviction was recorded by this
Court on 03.03.2016. Thus, in our view we are
being precluded by the clear and unequivocal

prohibition contained in section 369 Cr.P.C to

NAWABI/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
alter, amend or set aside the said judgment.
Section 369 Cr.P.C reads as under:-

369. Court not to alter
judgment. Save as _ otherwise
provided by this Code or by any
other law for the time being in

_ force or, in case of a High Court,
by the Letters Patent of such High

Court no Court when it has signed
its judgment, shall alter or review
the same, except to correct a
clerical error.”

5. Indeed, it is settled by the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan that the right to
claim review of any decision of a Court of
law, like the right to appeal, is a substantive
right and not a mere matter of procedure. The
scope of review by a court under criminal
jurisdiction has been elaborately expounded
by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
“Imdad_ Ali Khwaja’s case reported as 2016
SCMR 2057” as following:-

“Once an order is passed by one
Bench, the other Bench cannot
review such an order ordinarily. In
proceedings with the matters in
criminal jurisdiction, the High
Court does not have the power to
review an order.”

NAWABIPS* DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
sie

' The aforesaid law laid down by
the august Supreme Court of Pakistan is also
reflected in various judgments of the superior

Courts reported as “2016 PLD 195 Peshawar,

. 2013 PCrLJ 767 Peshawar, 1971 PCrLJ S.C

483, PLD 2015 S.C 322, PLD 2004 SC 911,
2014 SCMR 1609, 2012 SCMR 334, 2008
SCMR 165, 2008 SCMR 880, PLD 2004 SC
32, 2002 SCMR 1239, 2002 SCMR 1611, PLD
2001 S.C 433 and 1986 SCMR 965”.

6. . ‘However, judicial consensus has
developed in our country that certain orders of
criminal Court, which do not qualify to be a
judgment as provided in Chapter XXVI of the
Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court may
review its order in exceptional circumstances
under its inherent power. The law laid down
by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in
“Gulzar_Hassan_Shah’s_case_reported.as

PLD 1970 Supreme Court 335” referred by

the learned counsel for the petitioner in
support of his arguments is distinguishable as _

in the said matter the issue was relating to the

NAWAB/PS* = DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
747

cancellation of bail of the accused in his
absence. The order of the Court granting bail
or cancellation does not qualify to be a
judgment in terms of section 369 of the
Cr.P.C, therefore, the ratio of the said
judgment is not applicable to the present case
because in the present case this Court has
passed the order of conviction of the
petitioner. This judgment was distinguished
by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in

“Muhammad __Khalil-ur-Rahman’s case

reported as PLD 1995 SC 633”, wherein it

was observed:-

“I am conscious of the fact
that general principles of
finality of judgment attaches
to the decision or order of the
High Court passed in
criminal cases. But it will not
apply to cases where an order
is passed without jurisdiction
or without giving any
opportunity to the parties of
being heard. In such cases
section 561-A, Cr.P.C. can be
invoked for the purpose of
doing justice between the
parties and for seeing that the
act of the Court does not |
injury to any of the parties.
This is an inherent power of
the Court and has been
preserved by the above

NAWABIPS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
some arguable case, however, due to the fetters
imposed by section 369 CrP.c and the law laid
down by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan,
_we are unable to intervene in the matter and to
review the judgment of this Court passed on

03.03.2016. Hence, this petition being not

provision of law. In my opinion
in rare and exceptional cases
the High Court has inherent
power to invoke, review or alter
its own earlier decisions in
cases which are not governed
by Sections 369, 424 and 430,
Cr.P.C. with a view to give
effect to any order under the
Code or to prevent abuse of the
process of any Court or
otherwise to secure the ends of
justice. It is, however, not
possible to enumerate the
circumstances in which this
provision can be invoked. It
may, however, be mentioned
that the learned counsel for the
appellant has conceded that
application for bail can be
made from time to time on
fresh material. There is thus
no difficulty in such cases.”

On merit, the petitioner might have

maintainable is dismissed.
