KAMRAN _HAYAT_MIANKHEL, J:- Muhammad

Raziq son of Ashraf Khan and Mst. Zarshad alias
Yasmin wife of Wazir, appellants, were tried by the
learned Judge Special Court/Additional Sessions
Judge, Banda Daud Shah, District Karak for the
offence under section 9(C) of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 registered at Police Station
Terri, District Karak and after conclusion of trial, the
learned trail Court while holding the appellants guilty
of the offence, convicted them under section 9 (C)
CNSA and sentenced to suffer 03 years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- each, or in

default of payment of fine, they shall further undergo
simple imprisonment for six months. Benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C was also given to the
convicts/appellants vide judgment dated 26.3.2021.

2. On 30.01.2018, at about 16:40 hours, Saif
Ullah Khan, SHO of Police Station Terri, along with
other police officials, including lady constable Hazrat
Zubaida, acted upon special directives from Circle
SDPO, made barricade at the spot. While carrying out
this duty, they intercepted a Suzuki vehicle bearing
registration No. B-7785/Kohat traveling from the
Terrir side. Upon inspection, it was discovered that a
lady was seated in the front of the vehicle, with a
minor girl on her lap. Additionally, the lady had a
black coloured purse lying on her thighs. A thorough
search, conducted by a lady constable, led to the
recovery of two packets of charas Garda wrapped in
yellow plastic. These packets were weighed using a
digital scale, one packet weighing 1010 grams and the
other 950 grams, totaling 1960 grams. From this total,
5/5 grams of charas was separated from each packet
for forensic examination and sealed in parcels No. 1
and 2, while the remaining 1950 grams was sealed in

parcel No. 3. Further search of the vehicle revealed

another packet of charas Garda, weighing 1400
grams, concealed underneath the driver's seat. Similar
to the previous recovery, 5 grams of charas was
separated for forensic analysis and sealed in parcel
No. 4, while the remaining charas was sealed in
parcel No. 5. The female accused identified herself as
Mst. Zarshad alias Yasmina, and the minor girl
accompanying her was identified as Sherin Bibi, aged
about 2 to 3 years. The male accused, occupying the
driver's seat, disclosed his name as Muhammad
Raziq. Subsequently, the SHO drafted 'Murasila' and
forwarded it to the Police Station for the registration
of a case against the appellants. The accused were
promptly arrested at the scene, leading to the
registration of the case under FIR No. 54, dated
30.01. 2018, under Section 9(C) of the CNSA, 2019,
at Police Station Terri, District Karak

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused/appellants.
They were summoned and on appearance after
compliance of provisions under section 265-K
Cr.P.C, formal charge was framed against the
appellants, to which they pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial. The prosecution, in order to prove its

case against the appellants, produced lady constable
Hazrat Zubaida as PW-1, who is marginal witness to
the recovery memo Ex.PC, Sher Zaman ASI as PW-2,
who incorporated the contents of murasila into FIR.
PW-3 Shad Akbar OJI has conducted investigation in
the case, PW-4 is Complainant Siaf Ullah SHO, who
narrated the same facts as mentioned in the FIR and
also stated that at 18:10 hours the investigation officer
arrived to the spot who prepared the site plan on his
pointation. The 1.0 took the snap shot of both the
accused along with the contraband and Suzuki van.
He recorded his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.
He had shown the recovered contraband to the I.O on
the spot. Later on he handed over the case property
and the accused to Muharrir of the police station at
about 19:30 hours. PW-S is the statement of Nadeem
Ullah No.667, who took the murasila from the spot to
the police station Terrir and handed over it to Sher
Zaman Khan ASI.

4. After close of prosecution case, statement of
appellants were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein, they pleaded innocence and false
implication, however, neither opted to appear as their

own witness on oath or to produce evidence in their

defence. The learned trail Court, after hearing the
arguments of the learned counsel for the appellants
and learned APP appearing on behalf of the State
convicted and sentenced the appellants as noted
above. Hence, this appeal.

5. The prosecution in order to prove its case
produced Sher Zaman ASI, who incorporated the
contents of murasila into FIR. During cross-
examinations he admitted that complainant Saif Ullah
was on leave on that very day. The complainant stated
in his examination in chief that he had shown the
recovered contraband to the I.O on the spot. Later on
he handed over the case property and the accused to
Muharrir of the police station at about 19:30 hours,
however the investigation officer/PW-3 contrary to
the statement of the complainant stated in his cross-
examination that the case property mentioned above
was handed over to the Muharrir of the police station
by him. It is also admitted fact that the prosecution
has not produced register No. 19 of malkhana,
Police Station Terri District Karak, to prove that the
allegedly recovered contraband charas was
deposited in the Malkhan of the police station on

the same day by the complainant. Even Saif Ullah
Khan, SHO/complainant (PW-4) had not produced
abstract of register No.19 whereupon (PW-4) got
his signature for receiving of case property to
substantiate his plea. Under the said circumstance it
can safely be held that there is no iota of evidence
to establish that the alleged recovered contraband
was under the safe custody. Record further reflects
that important witnesses of the prosecution i.e.,
carrier of the sample of contraband to the FSL and
Moharrir of the police station were not examined by
the prosecution to prove that the case property was in
safe custody till its transmission to the FSL, hence,
none production of the said material witnesses cast
serious doubt on the prosecution case. The
withholding of this important evidence in the
peculiar circumstances of this case led us to draw an
adverse inference against the prosecution keeping in
view Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. The prosecution has failed to explain that
why the best evidence available with the
prosecution in shape of statements of above said
witnesses has been withheld. The said fact when
confronted with learned AAG, he failed to furnish

any explanation regarding such lapses of the

prosecution. After perusal of evidence on record, I
find that the prosecution has not established safe
custody of contraband to the police station as well
as safe transmission of sample parcel drawn from
recovered substance to the office of chemical
analysis. It is by now trite law that the prosecution
is obliged to establish that the chain of custody of
the case property as well as the sample separated
therefrom remained unbroken, unsuspicious,
indubitable, safe and secure and any break in the
chain of custody or lapse in the control of
possession of the sample, will cast doubts on the
safe custody and safe transmission of the sample
and will impair and vitiate the reliability of the
Report of the Government Analyst. In this case, the
elements of doubt surrounding the prosecution case,
as discussed above, has led this court to hold that
the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond
reasonable doubt to sustain the conviction. The
prosecution has not been able to establish that after
the alleged recovery the substance so recovered was
either kept in safe custody or that the sample taken
from the recovered substance had safely been

transmitted to the office of laboratory without being

tampered with or replaced while in transit. Reliance
can safely be placed on the case titled “Said Wazir

and another Vs. The State and others” reported in

(2023 SCMR 1144), wherein the apex Court has
held that:-

“Heard and perused the record.
It has been observed by us that
recovery was effected on
09.06.2016 whereas sample
parcels were received in the
office of chemical examiner on
13.06.2016 without any
plausible explanation as to
where remain these sample
parcels from 09.06.2016 to
13.06.2016. The safe custody
and safe transmission of the
sealed sample parcels has also
not been established by the
prosecution as Moharrar, who
kept the sample parcel in the
Malkhana and the concerned
Constable (FC No. 1374), who
delivered the sample parcel to
the office of Forensic Science
Laboratory, were not produced
by the prosecution. Even the
prosecution failed to prove the
ownership of the vehicle. This
court in the cases of Qaiser
Khan v. The State through
Advocate General, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar (2021
SCMR 363), Mst. Razia Sultana
v. The State and another (2019
SCMR 1300), The State through
Regional Director ANF v. Imam
Bakhsh and others (2018 SCMR
2039), Ikramullah and others v.
The State (2015 SCMR 1002)
and Amjad Ali v. The State
(2012 SCMR 577) has held that

in a case containing the above
mentioned defect on the part of
the prosecution, it cannot be
held with any degree of certainty
that the prosecution had
succeeded in establishing its
case against an accused person
beyond any reasonable doubt.”

Similarly, in Criminal Appeal No. 184 to 2020
decided on 06” January 2021 reported as 2021
SCMR 451, which held as under;

“The chain of custody or safe

custody and safe transmission of

narcotic drug begins with seizure

of the narcotic drug by the law |
enforcement officer, followed by
reparation of representative
samples of the seized narcotic
drug, storage of the representative |
samples and the narcotics drug
with the law enforcement agency
and then dispatch of the
representative samples of the
narcotics drugs to the office
chemical examination for
examination and testing. This
chain of custody must be safe and
secure. This is because, the report
of the chemical examination
enjoys critical importance under
CNSA and the chain of custody
ensure that correct representative
samples reach the office of the
chemical examiner. Any break or
gap in the chain of custody i.e. in
the safe custody or safe
transmission of the narcotic drug
or its representative samples
makes the report of the chemical
examiner unsafe and unreliable
for justifying conviction of the
accused. The prosecution,
therefore, has to establish that the

10

chain of custody has _ been
unbroken and is safe, secure and
indisputable on the report of
chemical examiner”.
6. Further reliance is placed on the case of Imam
Baksh’s case (2018 SCMR 2039), Zubair Khan V.
The State (2021 SCMR 492), Mst Razia Sulana V.
The State (2019 SCMR 1300).
7. Moreover, the FSL report, marked as
Ex.PW3/8, relied upon by the prosecution also does
not contain the full details of protocols of the test
applied for, which being unreliable cannot be made
a basis to sustain conviction and sentence of the
appellants. Now it has been declared by the august
apex court that "Protocol" means an explicit,
detailed plan of an experiment, procedure or test or
a precise step-by-step description of a test,
including the listing of all necessary reagents and
all criteria and procedures for the evaluation of the
test data. Rule 6 requires that full protocols of the
test applied be part of the Report of the Government
Analyst. Every test has its protocols, which are
internationally recognized and a test without the
observance of its protocols has no sanctity. "Full

Protocols" include description of each and every

11

step employed by the Government Analyst through
the course of conducting a test. Hence, the Report
under Rule 6 must specify every test applied for the
determination of the seized substances with the full
protocols adopted to conduct such tests and non-
compliance of Rule 6 can frustrate the purpose and
object of the Act, i.e., control of production,
processing and trafficking of narcotic drugs and
psychotropic substances, as conviction cannot be
sustained on a Report that is inconclusive or
unreliable. The evidentiary assumption attached to a
Report of the Government Analyst under section
36(2) of the Act underlines the statutory
significance of the Report, therefore details of the
test and analysis in the shape of the protocols
applied for the test become fundamental and go to
the root of the statutory scheme. Rule 6 is therefore,
in the public interest and safeguards the rights of
the parties. Any Report (Form-II) failing to-give
details of full protocols of the test applied will be
inconclusive, unreliable, suspicious and
untrustworthy and will not meet the evidentiary
assumption attached to a Report of the Government

Analyst under section 36(2). Reliance is placed on
12

case titled Khair-ul-Bashar Vs. The State, reported

in 2019 SCMR_ 930 and_Qaiser Javed Khan Vs.

The State through Prosecutor General Punjab,

Lahore and another, reported in PLD 2020 SC 57
wherein it has been held that:-

“6. The Report of the Government
Analyst in this case specifies only the
tests applied and not the protocols
thereof. The term "protocol" has not
been defined in the Rules. Its
dictionary meaning is: "A plan of
scientific experiment or other
procedure.*" It is also referred to as
"the precise method for carrying out
or reproducing a given experiment® a
These definitions are in line with the
elaboration of the term "protocol"
given in Imam Bakhsh wherein the
Court stated the expression "protocol"
to mean an explicit plan of an
experiment, procedure or test. It is
clarified that "protocol" is, therefore,
a recognized standard method or plan
for carrying out the test applied to
ascertain the nature of the substance
under examination. No test can take
place without a protocol. The Report
of the Government Analyst must
show that the test applied was in
accordance with a _ recognized
standard protocol. Any test conducted
without a protocol loses its reliability
and evidentiary value. Therefore, to
serve the purposes of the Act and the
Rules, the Report of the Government
Analyst must contain (i) the tests
applied (ii) the protocols applied to
carry out these tests (iii) the result of
the test(s).

8. The above discussion has led this Court to
believe that the learned trial court has erred in
appreciating the case evidence in its true perspective.

It has been held, time and again by the superior
13

courts, that a reasonable doubt found in the
prosecution case is sufficient to acquit an accused.
For extending the benefit of doubt, it is not necessary
that there should be many circumstances creating
doubts. Single circumstance, creating reasonable
doubt in the prudent mind about the guilt of accused,
makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of
grace or concession, but as a matter of right. Reliance
could be placed on 2009 SCMR 230, 2011 SCMR
664, 2011 SCMR 646, PLD 1984 SC 433, 2012
MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 PCr.LJ 376,
PLD 1994 Peshawar 114, PLD 2012 Peshawar 01,
1999 PCr.LJ 1087, 1997 SCMR 449, 2011 SCMR
820 and 2006 PCr.LJ SC 1002(sic). The conclusions
drawn by the learned trial Court are not borne out of
the case evidence, therefore, the impugned judgment

is not sustainable.

9. For what has been discussed above, I hold that
prosecution have not been able to prove their case
beyond reasonable doubts, therefore, the impugned
judgment warrants interference. As such this appeal is
allowed and the appellants are acquitted of the

charges leveled against them by extending them

14

benefit of doubt. They are in jail. Hence, they be
released forthwith, if not required in any other case

These are the detailed reasons of my short
order of even date.
