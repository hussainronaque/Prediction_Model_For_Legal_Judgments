ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:-_— By__ invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199
of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973,
(Constitution), petitioners Muhammad Waseem Deputy
Manager Sales & Marketing, Syed Rizwan Mehmood Shah
Deputy Manager Finance, Qazi Ibrar Hussain Deputy
Manager Internal Audit, Zamurad Khan Executive R&D
Telephone Industries of Pakistan (TIP) and Tahir Jan
General Secretary CBA TIP, who are behind the bars in
consequence of an Inquiry initiated by the National
Accountability Bureau (NAB) on a complaint of Ministry
of Information Technology and Telecom, Islamabad qua
corruption and corrupt practices in allotment of Plots in
TIP Housing Scheme, seek quashment of the above
proceedings against them. In interim relief, the petitioners

have sought for bail till disposal of the case.
2. Since, the matter is still under investigation before
the NAB. It is settled law that High Court seldom interfere
in investigation of the case by exercising its inherent
powers or constitutional jurisdiction, so that the
Investigating Agency come to a definite conclusion
without interference of any authority. The learned counsel
for petitioners when confronted with the proposition
regarding maintainability of writ petition for quashment of
Inquiry proceeding and that too in infancy, he candidly
conceded. However, requested for conversion of prayer in
instant petition for quashment to grant of bail. The learned
ADPG, at this moment opposed the request that grounds
for quashment of proceedings and grant of pre-arrest bail
are absolutely different and in the circumstances a relief
sought under constitutional jurisdiction cannot be molded.
In view of the submissions of learned counsel for the
parties coupled with complex position of the matter and in
the interest of justice, we deem it appropriate to treat this
writ petition for the purpose of bail of the petitioner by
deriving wisdom from the recent dicta of the Hon’ble Apex
Court in case titled, “Mian Asghar Ali Vs Governament
of Punjab through Secretary (Colonies) BOR, Lahore
and others” (2017 SCMR 118), wherein it has held that
High Court and Supreme Court have the powers to convert
or treat one kind of proceeding into another and such

powers derived from authority to do ex debito justitiae,
always existed and is exercised by the Court not only to
advance the cause of justice but also to prevent injustice.
No fetters or bar can be placed on the High Court and on
the Supreme Court to convert and treat one type of
proceeding into another and proceed to decide the matter
either itself provided it had jurisdiction over the lis that
was before it for adjudication or it may remit the lis to the
Court/forum/authority of competent jurisdiction for
decision of the lis on its own merits.

3. Allegations against the petitioners are that they
being the members of a so-called Committee, constituted
by the co-accused Chairman TIP Housing Scheme,
Huripur, recommended change of Master-plan, conversion
of amenities plots into residential despite the fact that
similar report was disapproved by the then Chairman TIP
Housing Scheme in 2013, and a result of their
recommendations, plots were allotted to some 145 allottees
including them, resultantly, they caused a huge financial
loss to government exchequer.

4. Valuable arguments of learned counsel for the
parties heard and record perused with their able assistance.

5. It appears from the record that TIP Housing
Cooperative Society was established in the decade of late
80’s on the acquired land of 1030 Kanals to meet the
residential needs of TIP employees/workers. The Bye-laws

were framed in 1988. The Primary Objectives of this
Society were to provide affordable residential facilities to
employees & Workers of the Organization, so the land was
divided into the plots of 4 different sizes viz 5, 7, 10 and 20
Marlas to make the scheme affordable for all income
groups. During the meeting held on 27.03.1990, the status
of Cooperative Housing Society was changed and it was
decided that the plots would be allotted under the name of
TIP Employees & Workers Housing Scheme. Vide
agreement/Iqrar Nama dated 22.04.1996 plots were allotted
to some employees in TIP Housing Scheme No.2. Record
reflects that in the year 2013, on the basis of number of
applications from TIP employees, the Management
constituted a Committee, comprising TIP Employees
Workers Union (Registered) CBA and Officers to study the
establishment documents, approved bylaws, layout plan,
agreement etc of Housing Schemes and explore the
possibilities of creation of residential plots while
maintaining sufficient provision of land/space for Schools,
Hospitals, Markets and Community Centre etc at standard
level and to suggest criteria for allotment of the Plots to
deserving officers/staff of TIP. The Committee submitted
its report on 02.07.2013, fevering the demand. However,
no action was taken on the report of the Committee.
Subsequently, by virtue of re-demand of the employees and
workers Union (CBA) vide application bearing

No.E& W/TIP/DED/26 dated 04.04.2016 to the Managing
Director TIP Haripur qua fulfillment of their demand in
respect of allotment of plots to eligible staff in TIP
Housing Scheme, another Committee was constituted.
Petitioners were the member of the said Committee. The
mandate of the Committee was to look into the matter and
propose method of allotment of plots to the deserving staff
of the TIP. The Committee submitted is report on
18.04.2016, wherein procedure and criteria of eligibility for
allotment of Plots were formulated, and resultantly, plots
were allotted on lease for a period of 99 years to some 145
staff members of TIP including the petitioner.

6. On tentative assessment of the material on record,
nothing solid has been collected by the NAB during
investigation to show that the allotments have been done
on the basis of favoritism, nepotism or against any
monetary gain. The allotment has not been done by the
petitioners, rather, they being members have only made
recommendations. Nothing is on the record to show these
recommendations to be based on any mala fide. Sufficient
record is available which shows that the lease money has
been deposited by the allottees directly in the Account of
TIP. The damage allegedly caused by the petitioners to the
government exchequer has not been determined till date.
Though, the petitioners have been allotted Plot in the said
allotment but it is apparent from the minutes of the meeting

that such allotment was for those staff/officials who were
not previously allotted any Plot in said Scheme. We do not
see anything in black & white to show that petitioners were
the previous allottees of the scheme. Except the petitioners
and Chairman of the committee, none from the rest 140
allottees has been made as accused by the respondents.
None from the TIP employees Workers union has made
any complaint against such allotment.

7. All the above observed facts and circumstances of
the case make the case of the petitioner arguable for the
purpose of bail coupled with the fact that investigation qua
the petitioners is complete and they are no more required
for further interrogation, hence, they are entitled to the
concession of bail. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail provided each one of
them furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees two millions
with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Accountability Court, Peshawar.
