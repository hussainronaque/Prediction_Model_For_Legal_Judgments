JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD FAHEEM WALL, J.- Through this single
judgment the fate of instant petition as well as Civil
Revision No.48-D/2015, titled ‘Abdul Waheed Khan

Kundi & others Vs. Mumtaz Khan & others’ will be

decided together as both are the outcome of same

judgments & decrees.

2. Joint facts of both the petitions are that Abdul
Waheed Khan etc (proforma respondents No.16 to 22)

instituted a suit seeking therein declaration that they and

proforma defendants being legacy heirs of ‘Abdul Karim

Khan Kundi’ are entitled to his legacy. Therefore, entries
in the revenue record in favour of defendants No.1 to 5
(now respondents No.1 to 15) as well as Mutation No.1375
dated 08.10.1925 are incorrect, illegal and are liable to be
cancelled to the extent of legal shares of plaintiffs and

proforma defendants.

3. Per contents of plaint Abdul Karim Khan, the grand
predecessor-in-interest of parties was having four sons
namely Muhammad Nawaz Khan, Muzaffar Khan, Masur
Alam Baig and Abdul Hameed Khan. Muhammad Nawaz
Khan fraudulently transferred the entire estate of Abdul
Karim Khan in his name through a gift mutation No.1375
dated 08.10.1925, and on the basis of said mutation, also
got transferred the occupancy rights in his favour. Thus,
other three brothers were illegally deprived of the bequest
of their father. Hence, respondents No.16 to 22
(plaintiffs/legal heirs of Abdul Hameed Khan) instituted
the suit by arraying respondents No.1 to 15 (LRs of
Muhammad Nawaz Khan) as defendants No. 1 to 5,
whereas, present petitioners were impleaded as legal heirs

of proforma defendants No.6-ii-a/3 and 8.

4, The suit was mainly contested by the respondents
No.1 to 15 (defendants No.1 to 4) in three sets by filing
their separate written statements. After framing issues and
processing the suit in accordance with the procedure, the
learned trial Court dismissed the same vide Judgment &
Decree dated 27.09.2011. Discontented with dismissal of
their suit, respondents No.16 to 20 preferred an appeal
which too was dismissed vide Judgment & Decree dated
05.12.2014 passed by the learned Additional District
Judge-I D.I.Khan. Now aggrieved of the dismissal of
appeal, petitioners, who were arrayed as proforma
respondents in the appeal and respondents No. 16 to 20,
who were appellants, have preferred the above referred
two civil revisions with the same prayer to set aside
concurrent findings of the Courts below and to decree the

suit.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel for parties heard

and record gone through.

6. The record transpires that parties are descendants of

one grand-father namely Abdul Karim Khan Kundi, who
was survived by four sons namely Muhammad Nawaz
Khan, Muzaffar Khan, Masur Alam Baig and Abdul

Hameed Khan. The entire estate of Abdul Karim Khan

was transferred in favour of his one son Muhammad
Nawaz Khan through gift mutation No.1375 dated
08.10.1925. Admittedly, at the time of filing suit on
25.11.1999, all the four brothers were not alive, however,

their legal heirs were impleaded in the suit.

7. The plaint and evidence of parties transpires that

remaining three sons of Abdul Karim Khan were aware of —

the impugned gift mutation dated 08.10.1925 in favour of
Muhammad Nawaz Khan but they did not challenge the
same despite the fact that they remained alive for many
years after the attestation of impugned mutation as, it

appears from the plaint that Muhammad Nawaz Khan died

in the year 1965, Muzaffar Khan died in the year 1970,

Masur Alam Baig died issueless in the year 1936 and
Abdul Hameed Khan died somewhere in 1947. Worthy
Supreme Court in a number of cases has held that if a
transaction was not challenged by the father, then his son,
after his death, will lack locus standi to challenge the

same. Reliance in this regard is placed on the case of Abdul

Haq and another Vs. Mst. Surrya Begun and others .

(2002 SCMR 1330) wherein it was held:

“Il. Atta Muhammad was deprived
of right to inherit the property as a

t

Lower
-

consequence of mutation in dispute
but he did not challenge the same
during his lifetime. The petitioners
claimed the property through Atta
Muhammad as his heirs who filed the
suit as late in 1979 about nine years
afer the sanction of mutation which
had already been given effect to in the
record of rights. The petitioners,
therefore, had no locus standi to
challenge the mutation
independently, for Atta Muhammad
through whom they claimed
inheritance himself had not
challenged the same during his

lifetime.”
8. Same view was reiterated in the case of “Mst. Grana
through Legal Heirs and others Vs. Sahib Kamala Bibi
and others” (PLD 2014 Supreme Court 167). Hence, in
view of the guidance derived from the above verdict of
worthy Apex Court, both sets of petitioners have no locus
standi to challenge the impugned mutation as same was

not challenged by their father.

9% Moreover, both sets of petitioners have not denied
the knowledge of impugned mutation dated 08.10.1925 to
their father as, mentioned above, Abdul Hameed died in

1947 and Masur Alam Baig died in the year 1936.

Thereafter, the legacy of Muhammad Nawaz Khan was
transferred to his sons upon his death in the year 1965,
which fact was also in their knowledge but they opted to
remain silent for 34 years long time, and filed present suit

on 25.11.1999. This fact not only constitutes estoppel and

waiver on the part of petitioners but also exposes them ~

before law of limitation. In the case of “Atta Muhammad
Vs. Maula Bakhsh and others” (2007 SCMR 1446)

august Supreme Court of Pakistan held:

“Findings of the learned two Courts
is that the plaintiffs were out of
possession and they have not been
able to establish receipt of rent and
profits from the land, although the
appellant claimed to the contrary.
This was the second
misrepresentation which disentitled
the plaintiffs to any relief in equitable
jurisdiction. The learned two Courts
held that the suit was barred by time
but the learned High Court, by
making a sweeping statement, that
there is no limitation in the cases of
inheritance has, in fact, rewritten the

law of limitation.”

10. A stale claim under the law of limitation cannot be

enforced legally as the passage of time sets the law of

ete ota Mt

Basen:
limitation in operation and there can be no exception

unless the relaxation is granted by the Limitation Act 1908
by itself. Reliance is placed on the case of “Umer Baz
Khan through L.Hrs Vs. Syed Jehanzeb & others” (PLD
2013 S.C. 268), “Mst. Grana through Legal Heirs and
others Vs. Sahib Kamala Bibi and others” (PLD 2014

Supreme Court-167).

11. It was also the claim of petitioners that the grand —

predecessor, Abdul Karim Khan Kundi, died prior to
execution of the impugned gift mutation but this

contention could not be established through evidence.

12. Yet there is another aspect of the case; petitioners
of instant petition were proforma defendants before the
learned trial court and they were placed and proceeded ex-
parte. After passing the impugned judgment & decree by
the learned trial court, they joined proceeding at appellate
stage but did not file any appeal or application for setting
aside decree, which was ex-parte to their extent, before the
learned trial court. This fact also estops them to challenge

the decree of learned trial court.

13. In the nutshell, both learned courts below have

rightly non-suited the petitioners. The decision so arrived

at by the two learned courts below is unexceptional and
need not to be interfered with by this Court in its limited
revisional jurisdiction. Consequently, this and connected
revision petitions are hereby dismissed with no order as to

cost.
