unknown person from Peshawar Airport to Tall
at 11 hours on 09.11.2013 was not returned
by the driver, namely, Musharraf son of Bakht
Jamal aged about 55 years, resident of
Sarband, Peshawar, the complainant reported
the matter to the local police of West Cantt:

and_ his report was incorporated in the Daily
Diary of the PS at Sr. No.18 dated
11.11.2013; leading to inquiry under Section
156 (3) Cr.P.C, during which, brother of driver
Musharraf, namely, Gulzar, son of Bakht
Jamal, resident of Sarband, recorded
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C and
alleged kidnapping for ransom of his
brother/driver, Musharraf, and the motorcar by
unknown person and confinement of his
brother and the motorcar at unknown place.
Consequent upon the inquiry, _ initially,
case/FIR was registered under Section 365-A
PPC in P.S West Cantt: (Gharbi), Peshawar,
vide FIR No.568 dated 05.12.2013. Earlier,
the complainant had reported in the P.S at
1015 hours on 11.11.2013, which was
recorded in the Daily Diary of the P.S at
Sr.No.18 dated 11.11.2013, about receiving
no response from his driver, Musharraf, after
the driver had informed him about hiring of
the Taxi Car, and on one occasion attending
of mobile phone of his driver by another

person who stated about his location as
Batkhela and also informed him about the
driver becoming unconscious after an
accident. According to the complainant, the
driver was located going towards Tall City,
but, thereafter, his cell phone was found
switched off. The complainant suspected
confinement of driver alongwith motorcar in
Tall City.

3. During investigation, accused-
appellants, Azmat Ullah son of Sher Zaman
and Muhammad Saeed son of Shahid, were
arrested on 07.12.2013, and
accused/appellant, _Hukman Shah, was
arrested on 11.12.2013. At the time of their
arrest, cell phones were recovered from all
the three accused/appellants. After their
arrest, on the pointation of
accused/appellants, Azmat Ullah and
Hukman Shah, the decomposed dead body of
deceased Musharraf was recovered from the
dry well of Poultry Farm of accused/appellant
Azmatullah in the presence of DHO Hangu

and Mr. Muhammad Mushtaq, Judicial
Magistrate-Il, Hangu, who certified the

minutes (approximately) and between death

8. The case of loss of contact with his
Taxi driver, namely, Musharraf son of Bakht

Jamal on 09.11.2013, reported to the local
police of P.S West Cantt: (Gharbi),
Peshawar, by owner of the Taxi
Car/complainant, Sangeen Khan, at 1015
hours on 11.11.2013 and recorded in the
Daily Diary of even date at Sr. No.18, was
initially inquired into under Section 156 (3)
Cr.P.C; after which, the local police reached
to the conclusion that driver, Musharraf, was
kidnapped for ransom; and report of the daily
diary was, therefore, converted into FIR
No.568 dated 05.12.2013 under Section
365-A PPC. In his report, recorded in the
daily diary of the P.S, the complainant had
reported hiring of his Taxi Car by a
passenger to a destination, which was
located as Tall City. Following the clue
furnished by the complainant, the local
police arrested the accused/appellants
during investigation after registration of the
case, and recovered dead body of the driver
from a dry well in the poultry Farm of
accused/appellant, Azmat Ullah, on his

pointation as well as on the pointation of co-
accused, Hukman Shah. They both also
recorded their confessional statements,
narrating therein the story of hiring of the
Taxi Car by the accused/appellant, Hukman
Shah, from Peshawar Airport — for
Darsamand and taking the Taxi Car along
with driver to the Poultry Farm — of
accused/appellant, Azmat Ullah, situated in
village Darsamand, and also the fact of
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, effectively
firing and causing death of the driver when
the deceased driver showed resistance to
the demand of the accused to hand over
keys of the Motorcar to them. They also
disclosed the factum of throwing/dumping
the dead body in a dry well situated in the
said Poultry Farm, and covering the well with
stones and mud. The decomposed dead
body of deceased Musharraf, was recovered
from the said dry well on the pointation of
both the accused/appellants in the presence
of DHO Hangu as well as learned Judicial

Magistrate Hangu. At the time of recovery of
dead body of the deceased, Musharraf,
another dead body of a Taxi driver shot dead
and also thrown/dumped in the said dry well
in similar circumstances, was also
recovered, and both the accused/appellants
separately recorded their confessional
statements before another learned Judicial
Magistrate in the case registered relating to
that abduction and murder vide FIR No.581
dated 11.12.2013 under Sections
302/412/386/392/201/34 PPC P.S Doaba.
The weapon of offence i.e. 30 bore pistol
was also recovered from the house of
accused/appellant, Azmat Ullah, on his
pointation, which was declared in working
condition by the Firearms expert. As such,
the prosecution was able, with painstaking
and laudable efforts on the part of the
investigating agency, to build up an edifice
of its case against the accused/appellants,
Azmatullah and Hukman Shah, right from
the very beginning starting from report of

the complainant, Sangeen Khan, recovery of
the dead body of deceased, Musharraf,
from a dry well in the Poultry Farm of
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, situated for
away from Peshawar in village Darsamand,
augmented by confessional statements of
the accused/appellants, of recovery of
another dead body from the same_ well in
the Poultry Farm of the accused/appellant,
shot dead in the same way after his
abduction along with Taxi Car from
Islamabad  Aijirport, and _— confessional
statements of both the accused/appellants
in that case as well, before another Judicial
Magistrate, who was also present alongwith
DHO Hangu at the time of recovery of both
the dead bodies of drivers of Taxi Cars, who
were shot dead by accused/appellant,
Azmatullah, after they showed resistance,
and were thrown/dumped in the like manner
in the dry well situated in the Poultry Farm of
the accused/appellant. The recovery of
weapon of offence i.e.30 bore pistol from the

house of accused/appellant, Azmatullah, on
his pointation further substantiated has
already established main role in the
commission of the offences, particularly
Qatl-i-Amd of deceased driver, Musharraf.

9. In short, a case of blind murder, not
witnessed by anyone with his own eyes, was
proved by the prosecution through
circumstantial evidence, establishing links of
chain of events starting from abduction of
the Taxi driver, Musharraf, from Peshawar
Airport and his Qatl-i-Amd by _ the
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, in his
Poultry Farm. situated for way from
Peshawar at Darsamand, and then taking
away all the belongings of the deceased
including cash amount and cell phone and
other documents and throwing/dumping the
dead body in a dry well in the Poultry Farm
by both the accused/appellants. The
recovery of dead body from the dry well
situated in the Poultry Farm _ of
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, on his

pointation as well as on the pointation of co-
20

accused, Hukman Shah, and _ their
confessional statements whereby they
furnished graphic details of abduction of the
deceased and his murder proved case of
the prosecution beyond any shadow of
doubt, of course, in the light of statements
of 17 PWs produced by the prosecution,
including, the complainant, brother and son
of the deceased, both the learned Judicial
Magistrates, Medical officer, witnesses to the
recovery memos, a Taxi driver at Peshawar
Airport and investigating officers in the case,
which remained consistent and confidence
inspiring, fully corroborating sequence of
events in material details, and not shattered
during lengthy cross examination by the
defence. Their coherent statements left no
doubt about abduction of the poor taxi driver
by both the accused/appellants, Azmatullah
and Hukman Shah, and his cold blooded
murder in a ruthless and callous manner by
the accused/appellant, who had also enacted

an unfortunate tragedy of the same kind in
21

the past, without any remorse penitence. The
inhuman conduct of both the
accused/appellants deserve no leniency,
especially when one of them is owner of a
Poultry Farm and he, with the connivance of
his co-accused, would touch the abysmal of
human conduct by first kidnapping poor taxi
drivers and then committing their qatl-i-amd
in a cruel and dreadful manner. In the
circumstances, the learned trial Court/Judge,
Anti Terrorism Court, had no other choice
but to hold both the accused/appellants
guilty of commission of offences.

10. In the absence of ocular account, the
case of the prosecution admittedly rested on
confessional statements of the
accused/appellants, further corroborated by
recovery of the dead body from the place
belonging to accused/appellant, Azmatullah,
on his pointation as well as on the
pointation of co-accused/appellant, Hukman
Shah, and also recovery of weapon of

offence i.e. 30 bore pistol from the house of
22

accused/appellant, Azmatullah, on his
pointation, further corroborated by the P.M
report showing 1 entry wound with
corresponding exit wound on the head of
the deceased. In the given circumstances,
no role of accused/appellant, Muhammad
Saeed Khan is discernable either in the
abduction of the deceased or his qatl-i-amd.
The only role assigned to accused/appellant,
Muhammad Saeed Khan, was_ that of his
relations with accused/appellant, Hukman
Shah, and having in his possession the cell
phone of deceased, Musharraf, which,
according to his confessional statement was
handed over to him by accused/appellant,
Hukman Shah, during his stay for a_ night
with him. The accused/appellant,
Muhammad Saeed Khan, however, denied
any knowledge of the occurrence or even of
the fact that the mobile was stolen property,
in his exculpatory confessional statement,
which even otherwise cannot be used against

him after the same having been retracted
23

by him in his statement under Section 342
Cr.P.C. In the absence of any _ other
incriminating evidence against
accused/appellant, Muhammad Saeed
Khan, his appeal is accepted, and the
impugned judgment dated 21.03.2015 to the
extent of his conviction and sentences
awarded to him is set aside; and he is
acquitted of the charges, and be released
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

11. As regards case of abduction under
Section 365-A PPC against the remaining
two-co-accused/appellants Azmatullah and
Hukman Shah, it is not only established from
the evidence available on record discussed
above, but also from __ confessional
statements of both the accused/appellants
that they shared the common_ intention of
abduction of the deceased Taxi driver for the
purpose of extorting ‘property’ from him,
which was executed by accused/appellant,
Hukman Shah, by hiring the Taxi Car from

Peshawar Airport and taking the same to
24

Poultry Farm of accused, Azmatullah,
situated at a faraway place in darsamanad,
where the unfortunate qatl-i-amd of poor
Taxi driver also took place at the hands of
owner of the poultry farm and co-
accused/appellant, Azmatullah. As such,
both the accused/appellants were rightly
held guilty and convicted for abduction
under Section 365A PPC and awarded the
punishment of imprisonment for life, which
is accordingly upheld/maintained; and
appeal of the accused/appellants to that
extent is dismissed.

12. The evidence leading the learned trial
Court to hold both the accused/appellants
guilty of offence of Qatl-i-Amd of deceased
Taxi driver, Musharraf, under Section 302
PPC read with Section & (a) ATA, 1997, and
awarding them the punishment of death and
fine of Rs.300000/- each, needs re-
appraisal in the light of the evidence
comprising P.M report showing only one

firearm wound on head of the deceased
25

caused by accused/appellant, Azmatullah,
with his 30 bore pistol, when the deceased
showed resistance to the demand of the
accused/appellant to hand over keys of the
motorcar to him. As pointed out earlier, the
prosecution case drives its strength, mainly,
from the confessional statements of the
accused/appellants, which categorically
imputed the single fire shot to the
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, and which
also appears to be his individual act after the
deceased showed resistance to the demand
of handing over keys of the Motorcar to the
accused/appellant; because not only both
the accused/appellants shared common
intention only to the extent of abduction of
the deceased Taxi driver for extorting
‘property’ from him, which was executed by
co-accused Hukman Shah, but recovery of
weapon of offence i.e. 30 bore pistol, in
working condition, from the house of
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, would also

substantiate the proposition with regard to
26

the role of only accused/appellant,
Azmatullah, in the commission of offence of
gatl-i-amd of deceased Musharraf. In short,
no active role of accused/appellant,
Hukman Shah, has been proved on record
in the Qatl-i-Amd of deceased, Musharraf.
Therefore, the appeal of _ the
accused/appellants, is partially accepted to
the extent of accused/appellant, Hukman
Shah, and he is acquitted of the charge of
gatl-i-amd under Section 302 PPC read with
Section 7 (a) ATA, 1997. The impugned
judgment of the learned trial Court/Judge,
Anti Terrorism Court, Peshawar dated
21.03.2015 is accordingly set aside, together
with conviction and punishment of death and
fine of Rs.300000/- awarded to
accused/appellant, Hukman Shah. However,
in view of the overwhelming evidence
available on record against the
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, proving the
commission of offence of gatl-i-amd of

deceased, Musharraf, by the
27

accused/appellant, his conviction under
Section 302 PPC read with Section 7 (a)
ATA1997, and penalty of death with fine of
Rs.300000/- payable to legal heirs of
deceased and in default of payment of fine
to further two years imprisonment by the
learned trial Court/Judge, Anti Terrorism
Court, Peshawar dated 21.03.2015 are
upheld/maintained, and his appeal is,
accordingly, dismissed.

13. Adverting to the conviction of both the
accused/appellants under Section 382 PPC,
suffice it to say that in the light of evidence
adduced by the prosecution and even their
own confessional statements, the offence
under the above stated section of law is
abundantly proved in view of taking away of
cash amount, a cell phone and _ other
documents from the deceased and also
selling the motorcar and the sale proceeds
equally shared by both the
accused/appellants. Therefore, the learned

trial Court/ Judge, Anti Terrorism Court,
28

Peshawar, rightly convicted them under
Section 382 PPC and sentenced them to
ten years R.I and fine of Rs.50,000/- each
and in default thereof to further six months
RI.

14. So far the last charge under Section 15
AA against accused/appellant, Azmatullah,
is concerned, it has been clearly proved on
record by the prosecution that the
unlicensed 30 bore pistol, being weapon of
offence, was recovered on his pointation
from his house, and the recovery of the
unlicensed 30 bore pistol was also proved
through un-wavered depositions of the PWs.
Consequently, the conviction of the
accused/appellant, Azmatullah, under
Section 15 AA is also upheld/maintained,
together with the punishment _ of
imprisonment for three years S.1.

15. The punishment of imprisonment
awarded to both the accused/appellants
shall run concurrently, with benefit of Section

382-B Cr.P.C extended to them.
29

16. The appeals (Cr.A No.204-P/2015)
and Cr.A No.193-P/2015) are disposed of,
accordingly; and Criminal Revision No.46-
P/2015, having become _ infructuous,
pursuant to acquittal of |§accused/
respondent, Muhammad Saeed Khan, is
hereby dismissed. The Murder Reference
No.7 of 2015 in respect of accused appellant
Hukam Shah is answered in the negative;
while the same is answered in the affirmative

to the extent of accused/appellant,

Azmatullah.
