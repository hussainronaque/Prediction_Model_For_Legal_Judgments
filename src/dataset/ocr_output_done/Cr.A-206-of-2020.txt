Shaheen Zari was convicted u/s 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with
compensation of Rs.300,000/- payable to legal heirs
of the deceased, in case of default thereof the
appellant was directed to undergo further six months
S.I. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C was extended
to her. Co-accused Saeed Ullah and Sardar Ullah
were acquitted of the charge.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on receipt
of information regarding murder in village
Dambara, Muzafar Khan ASHO (PW-7) rushed to
the house of Hanif Ullah situated in the said village
alongwith police contingents where he found a dead
body in residential room of the present
appellant/convit in pool of blood. A pistol 30 bore

his front side pocket from which name of the

Zada resident of Neem Kalay Aloch besides, a

Samsung mobile phone and cash amount of

brother-in-law/co-accused Saeed Ullah to the effect
that her husband Hanif Ullah had met an accident,
so, he had proceeded to Mingora for repair of the
vehicle. During night time when she was asleep
alongwith her children, at 03:00 hours someone
opened the door of her room, so, she woke up and
saw that an unknown person had entered her room.
She picked up pistol of her husband from below her
pillow and fired at the unknown person due to which
he sustained multiple injuries on his body and died
on the spot. She stated that the occurrence has been

4. The present appellant Mst. Shaheen
Zarl was nominated as accused in the case whereas
her two brothers-in-law namely Saeed Ullah and
Sardar Ullah were also later on nominated in the
case. The matter was investigated by Humayun Khan
ASHO (PW-13) whereafter complete challan was put
in Court against the present appellant and her co-
accused named above. On commencement of trial,
they were formally indicted for the offence to which
they did plead guilty and opted to face the trial. In
order to prove its case against them, prosecution
examined as many as 14 PWs. After closure of
evidence, the present appellant and her co-accused
were examined u/s 342, Cr.P.C during which the
present appellant/convict stated that she had acted in
exercise of her private defence. The other co-
accused, however, professed innocence and denied
the allegation of prosecution. They neither recorded
their own statements on oath nor opted to produce
any witness in their defence. On conclusion of trial,
the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
30.07.2020 convicted and sentenced the present
appellant Mst. Shaheen Zari in the manner already
discussed above, however, her co-accused were

acquitted of the charge. Hence, these appeals.

3. We have heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties including the learned
A.A.G. for State and gone through the record with
their able assistance.

6. Admittedly, the report was lodged by
the present appellant/convict stating therein that an
unknown person had entered her room at night time
when she was asleep with her kids whereas her
husband Hanif Ullah was away from home for the
purpose of repairing his dented vehicle. On getting
sight of the stranger, she picked up pistol of her
husband and fired at the intruder as result whereof
he became wounded and died on the spot. On arrival
of police to her house, the deceased, as per his CNIC
recovered from his pocket, was identified as Sher
Khaliq son of Sher Zada resident of Neem Kalay
Aloch, District Shangla. On his further body search,
a 30 bore pistol with 15 rounds, Samsung mobile
phone and cash amount of Rs.21,050/- were also
recovered from him.

Z Spot of the occurrence is established in
light of recovery of dead body as well as blood, two
crime empties of 30-bore and a spent bullet from
residential room of the appellant/convict and she has

not denied the said recoveries during her

examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C. She has also admitted
murder of the deceased in her statement u/s 342,
Cr.P.C through a 30 bore pistol No. 1377 of her
husband which was taken into possession vide
recovery memo Ex.PC. Thus, murder of the
deceased by the present appellant/convict inside her
house is an admitted fact in view of her report as
well as her statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C, however, we
do not find ourselves in agreement with findings
recorded by the learned trial Court in the impugned
judgment while convicting her for the said murder.
8. Admittedly, the occurrence took place
during nocturnal hours. The appellant/convict was
present in her house alongwith her minor kids
whereas her husband was away from the house. The
very act of surreptitious entry by a stranger armed
with pistol at night time into the room of a young
lady, who was all alone in her room, and his murder
by her in exercise of her right of private defence is
not only believable but the same is also inferable
from the attending circumstances of the case because
she had no other option at that critical situation but
to fire at the intruder. Right of private defence is to
be inferred from facts and circumstances of case and

the law, as observed by Lahore High Court in the

case of Maina Vs. The State (PLD 1972 Lahore
129), makes accused sole judge of his own danger
and permits him to repel attack even to extent of
taking life of his adversary within limits of S. 100 of
the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860. The
appellant/convict in the present case has taken the
said plea from the very inception of the case and
during her examination u/s 342, CrP.C she
categorically took the stance that she had acted in
her defence. A young lady in the company only of
her kids could not expect that a trespasser armed
with pistol had entered her room during nocturnal
hours with a good intention, therefore, her act of
firing at the deceased in the said situation cannot be
termed in excess than what was required at the
relevant time. The well-established principle laid
down in this regard by the august Supreme Court is
that the action on the part of the person in such
critical situation cannot be measured in golden
scales. The appellant/convict being a female and
alone in her room had no choice at the relevant time
to act in a weighed and pondered manner for repulsing
the deceased for protection of her life, honour and
safety of her minor kids. Reliance is placed on Mashal
Khan Vs. The State (PLD 1988 Supreme Court 25)

os: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim

wherein conviction and sentence of accused, who

had acted in exercise of right of private defence, was
set aside and he was acquitted of the charge by

observing that:

The learned Acting Chief Justice has observed

that it was manifest that there was great

apprehension in the mind of the appellant that

he would be either killed or severely injured

by the deceased. It is reasonably probable that

the deceased had taken out a knife in order to

attack the appellant as stated in the

confessional statement and it was due to the

great apprehension’ in the mind of the

appellant that he would be killed or severely LS
injured like his brother that he took out the Le :
firearm which he always carried due to this po
fear and fired at the deceased while he might
have turned back on seeing the firearm having
been drawn at him. In such a state of panic
when the right of self-defence is being
exercised, the action on the part of the person
cannot be measured in golden scales and this
principle had been reiterated by this Court on
numerous occasions.

9. Although it is also the case of

prosecution that the appellant/convict had illicit

relations with the deceased and in support of the said
allegation against them CDR of SIM No. 0307-
5901614 of the deceased and SIM No. 03473540857
allegedly used by appellant/convict has been brought
on the record. The record shows that the J.O had
taken into possession mobile phone having SIM No.
0348-0479801 from the appellant vide recovery

memo Ex.PC/3 regarding which no CDR data is

available on record to establish her contact with the
deceased whereas there is no evidence on the record
that SIM No. 03473540857, regarding which CDR
was obtained, was registered in her name. Thus,
prosecution has not established any telephonic
contact between the appellant/convict and deceased
through any convincing evidence. The appellant had
taken a plea in her defence which is to be taken in
entirety and prosecution has failed to bring any
evidence on record in rebuttal of the said version of
the appellant/convict. In light of the facts and
circumstances of the case and evidence available on
the record, prosecution could not discharge its
burden of proving the case against the appellant,
hence, she is entitled to get the benefit of
circumstances of the case which leads a prudent
mind to the conclusion that she had acted in her
defence. Wisdom is drawn from Zarid Khan Vs.
Gulsher and another (1972 SCMR 597). The august
Supreme Court of Pakistan observed in the said
judgment that:

The onus is entirely on the prosecution to

prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt. If

in the facts and circumstances of the case there

appears a likelihood of the existence of a right

of private defence, the accused is entitled to the

benefit of this right, for, such a situation will
react on the whole prosecution case and will

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

lead the Court to hold that the prosecution has
failed to prove its case beyond any reasonable
doubt.

Thus, the learned trial Court has arrived

at a wrong conclusion by convicting Mst. Shaheen
Zari for the murder of deceased.
10. As regards acquittal of co-accused
Saeed Ullah and Sardar Ullah by trial Court through
the same judgment, which is the subject-matter of
the connected Cr.A No. 198-M/2020, admittedly
they have been charged in the case by Said Nabi
(PW-10), brother of deceased, at a belated stage
after nine days of the occurrence. The appellant/
convict has not attributed any role to them in the FIR
nor any incriminating thing has been recovered from
their possession, therefore, the impugned judgment
to the extent of acquittal of the afore-said co-accused
needs no interference by this Court.

il. In light of what has been discussed
above, the appeal preferred by appellant/convict
Mst. Shaheen Zari is allowed, the impugned
judgment to the extent of her conviction and
sentence is set aside and she is acquitted of the

charge leveled against her by prosecution. She be set

at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case.
The connected Cr.A No. 198-M/2020, having no
merits, is accordingly dismissed in limine whereas
the connected Cr.R No. 31-M/2020 is also dismissed
for having become infructuous.

of the even date.
