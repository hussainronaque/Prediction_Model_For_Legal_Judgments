memo Ex.PC/1.

Shafeerullah Constable (PW-7) is marginal

witness to the recovery memo Ex.PW7/1 vide which in

his presence the accused-appellant Fazal Majeed was

arrested. He stated that at the time of arrest the accused

was armed with .30 bore pistol P-1 fixed with charger

containing three rounds of the same bore as P-2 being

the weapon of offence with which murder was

committed by the accused-appellant. He had signed the

recovery memo and in this respect his statement under

Mumtaz Khan SI (PW-8) is the I.O who

conducted investigation in the case. He went to the spot,

prepared the site plan Ex.PB at the instance of the

complainant and during spot inspection took into

possession blood through cotton as P-1 from the place of

also recorded the statements of the PWs under section

161 Cr.P.C and conducted house search of the accused

but when reached Gul Bagh there he received the

information on wireless that the accused Fazal Majeed

was arrested by SHO Rahim Khan. He further stated

that on the recovery of pistol another FIR No. 75 of the

same date was registered under section 13 A.O against

the accused-appellant which was also investigated by

him and had recorded the statements of the PWs of that

case. On the pointation of Muhammad Rahim SHO, he

prepared the pointation memo Ex.PB/1 in respect of the

spot of arrest of the appellant. He also prepared

pointation memo Ex.PC/1 at the instance of the accused-

appellant and recorded his statement under section 161

Cr.P.C. He dispatched the blood stained articles to the

serologist whose report is Ex.PZ and also dispatched the

pistol alongwith empties to the FSL for examination,

report whereof is Ex.PZ/1. On completion of the

investigation he handed over the case file to the SHO for

submission of complete challan in the case.

Iqrar Ali, ASI (PW-9) deposed that while on

gusht he received information from Civil Hospital
7

Hangu that a dead body has been brought there. He

accordingly rushed there where the complainant

Muhammad Amir reported the matter to him which he

recorded in the shape of murasila Ex.PA/1 which bears

his signature as well as thumb impression of the

complainant as a token of its correctness. He prepared

the injury sheet Ex.PM/1 and inquest report Ex.PM/2 of

the deceased and the same also bear his signature. He

then dispatched the dead body for post-mortem to the

doctor.

PW-10 Muhammad Rahim ASI PTC Hangu

stated that on 9.2.2013 he was on gusht when received

information about the killing of a person and the fleeing

of the accused at Ganjano Kalay road. He proceeded to

the spot, alerted the rider squads and also chased the

accused and on his arrest a .30 bore pistol bearing

No.A9709 with a fixed charger and three rounds of the

same bore were recovered from his possession which

was giving the smell of freshly fired weapon. He

arrested the accused, prepared his arrest card

Ex.PW10/1, drafted the murasila upon which case F.I.R
8

No. 75 under section 13 A.O was registered at Police

Station City on 9.2.2013.

4. After the closure of the prosecution evidence, the

convict-appellant was examined under section 342

Cr.P.C. who pleaded innocence and denied the

allegations of the prosecution brought against him.

However, he neither wished to produce any evidence in

his defence nor himself appeared as his own witness in

disproof of the allegations of prosecution as provided

under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. On conclusion of the trial,

after hearing of the learned counsel for the parties and

appraising the evidence, the learned trial Judge

convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned in

the introductory part of this judgment, hence the present

appeal.

5. The learned counsel for the appellant vehemently

attacked the impugned judgment of conviction and

sentence of the appellant. He argued that the appellant is

innocent and has been falsely charged by the

complainant as apparently the occurrence is unwitnessed

one. He contended that there are grave and serious

contradictions in the statements of the PWs which
9

escaped the sight of the learned trial court while

recording the impugned judgment of conviction. He

contended that it is the consistent view of the august

apex court that when there are contradictions in the

statements of the PWs, its benefit should go to the

accused. He lastly contended that the crime weapon has

been planted against the appellant by the prosecution so

as to bring its case in line with the version advanced by

the complainant party and thus the appellant deserves

acquittal.

6. The learned Assistant Advocate General assisted

by the learned counsel for the complainant supported the

impugned judgment of the learned trial Judge in its

entirety.

7. Arguments heard and the available record

minutely perused with the assistance of the learned

counsel for the parties.

8. In the present case, it was the complainant

Muhammad Amir who reported about the occurrence at

Civil Hospital Hangu at 16:55 hours to the effect that he

alongwith his deceased uncle Nawab Khan and aunt

Mst. Nazeera Jan while proceeding to their house from
10

Kohat when reached the place of occurrence at 16:35

hours, the appellant namely, Fazal Majeed, armed with a

pistol appeared and fired at Nawab Khan which resulted

in his death on the spot and the incident was witnessed

by Mst. Nazeera Jan, widow of the deceased. Motive

was stated to be previous blood feud. He narrated the

same eye-witness account of the occurrence while

recording his statement before the learned trial court as

PW-1. He was subjected to a lengthy cross-examination

but he stuck to his version regarding the incident and

despite the best efforts of the learned defence counsel,

he was unable to dislodge the stance of the complainant.

Rather during such exercise he further explained and

elaborated the mode and manner of the incident. In this

respect, it would be apt to reproduce some portions of

his cross-examination as below:

“We might have reached Hangu via flying coach at
16:00 hours.”

“The place of occurrence might be at a distance of 1
to 4% KM from the place where we were deboarded
from the flying coach at main bazaar Hangu.”

“The accused appeared from the street armed with
pistol and proceeded 2/3 paces from me and had
then made fire upon the deceased.”
11

“I saw the accused who appeared in a spur of
moment and at a distance of 3 paces from me. Self
stated that then he fired upon the deceased.”

“The deceased got hit at about 16:35 hours and the
rickshaw was brought by somebody within five
minutes.”

“T and my maternal aunt and deceased boarded in
the rickshaw to the hospital. We reached to the
hospital Hangu within five minutes. When we
brought the dead body to the Civil Hospital Hangu,
the police was not already present in the hospital.
The police reached to the Civil Hospital after 5/6
minutes after our arrival to the hospital.”

As such through his cross-examination, he

adequately explained the site plan prepared at his

instance and the places assigned to the deceased and

eye-witness Mst. Nazeera Jan as well as the distance

between the appellant, the complainant and the

deceased.

9. Mst. Nazeera Jan accompanying her deceased

husband Nawab Khan and the complainant Muhammad

Amir also furnished her ocular account and narrated the

same facts as given by the complainant in his deposition

before the learned trial court. She was also subjected to

the test of a real lengthy and searching cross-

examination but she did not budge an inch as far as the

facts leading to the murder of her husband at the hands

of the appellant are concerned. She when questioned
12

duly explained her departure from the house of her

relative namely, Jamadar, at about 10:00 am on the day

of occurrence, the killing of her husband at 16:35 hours

and also the time consumed in reaching Hangu as she

had visited the hospital for her treatment. Some excerpts

from her  cross-examination being relevant are

reproduced below:

“The accused suddenly emerged and was at a
distance of 5 paces ahead of me. Fazal Majeed
accused facing trial was previously known to me
as he had paid many visits to our house. We had
blood feud enmity with the accused facing trial
which is more than 20 years old.”

Thus in one breath she not only explained the details of

the site plan but the blood feud with the appellant as

well. In reply to another question, she stated “The

complainant PW Amir was a little ahead of me while

I was following him.” The same is exactly in line with

the site plan. She was not further quizzed regarding the

site plan in order to make some dent in her statement

except the routine and perfunctory questions regarding

her and the complainant’s presence at the time of

occurrence were put to her which she on a rather

dismissive note termed as incorrect. To another
13

question, she replied “the accused made two fire

shots.” Thus by every count, both the witnesses of the

ocular account have given straightforward statements

about the occurrence and as to how the deceased was

done to death by the appellant with his pistol. They have

not contradicted each other on any material aspect of the

case and there is a seal of truthfulness strongly affixed

on their statements. Minor and, of course, negligible

contradictions which may appear in their statements as

far as the visit to Kohat is concerned can in no manner

dislodge and bring into even a remotest degree of doubt

their ocular testimony which despite the best and

strenuous efforts of the defence in the cross-examination

goes unshattered.

10. During the course of arguments, the learned

counsel for the appellant contended that the ocular

testimony has been furnished by interested witnesses

and conviction cannot be based on their evidence. We

are afraid such argument is both misplaced and

misconceived in the present case. No doubt, both the

eye-witnesses are closely related to the deceased but

mere relationship is no ground to discard their
14

straightforward and confidence inspiring evidence

which is otherwise free from the element of

consultations and deliberations in view of the

promptitude whereby the report was made within a span

of 20 minutes from the time of occurrence and also, of

course, false implication. Reliance in this respect is

placed on case titled “Sharafat Ali vs. The State” (1999

SCMR 329).

11. As far as the medical evidence is concerned, Dr.

Furqan (P.W.4) conducted autopsy on the dead body of

deceased Nawab Khan and found two entry wounds

with corresponding exit wounds on his body.

12. Admittedly, two empties of .30 bore as P-2 were

recovered from the spot near the place of the accused by

the I.O and the same when taken in juxtaposition with

the medical evidence, fully support the statement of the

complainant and the eye-witness Mst. Nazeera Jan

whereby she stated that the accused-appellant had fired

two shots with which her husband was hit and died on

the spot.

13. After the commission of the offence at 16:35

hours, the appellant tried to make good his escape in the
15

direction of Ganjano Kalay but as the local police was

already alerted regarding the murder committed by him,

therefore, he was arrested at a short distance away from

the crime spot at 17:25 hours i.e. within a short period of

50 minutes alongwith crime pistol of .30 bore bearing

No. A9709 with fixed charger and 3 rounds of the same

bore by PW-10 Muhammad Rahim who was at that time

posted as SHO Police Station City Hangu. As per PW-

10, “the pistol was giving freshly fired smell” and

accordingly case FIR No. 75 of the same date under

section 13 A.O was registered at Police Station City

Hangu against the appellant. The two .30 bore crime

empties recovered from the spot and the .30 bore pistol

recovered from the accused-appellant at the time of his

arrest were sent to the FSL and in this respect the report

of the Fire Arms Expert (Ex.PZ/1) is as below:

“OPINION. Microscopic examination of the case
has revealed that the two 30 bore crime empties
marked C1 and C2 were fired from 30 bore pistol
No. A 9709 in question, in view of the following
major points i.e. striker pin marks, breach face
marks, chamber marks, etc are similar.”

14. The accused-appellant was also tried in case FIR

No. 75 of the same date under section 13 A.O and

finally convicted and sentenced to 2 years R.I with a
16

fine of Rs. 3000/- or in default to further undergo ten

days S.I by the learned Sessions Judge, Hangu vide

judgment dated 9.9.2014 against which he has preferred

Cr.A No. 541-P/2014 which too, is dismissed through a

separate judgment of the even date.

15. In view of the above discussion, the prosecution

case through promptly lodged FIR, confidence inspiring

ocular testimony, recovery of crime empties from the

spot, supportive medical evidence, arrest of the accused-

appellant within a short span of 50 minutes, the recovery

of crime pistol giving freshly fired smell and the

positive report of the firearms expert is proved against

the appellant to the hilt and that is how the learned trial

court has rightly convicted and sentenced him vide the

impugned judgment. As such we dismiss the instant

appeal and maintain the conviction and sentence of the

appellant. The death sentence awarded to the appellant

is confirmed and the Murder Reference is answered in

the affirmative.
