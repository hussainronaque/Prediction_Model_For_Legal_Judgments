JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- On

30.9.2018, Imtiaz, SHO Police Station,
Machnigate, (PW-6) received information
regarding trafficking of huge quantity of chars by
two youngsters in Mehran Motorcar bearing
registration No. ACJ-852, via Canal Road. On
such information, he alongwith other police
contingent made a barricade near Sultan qila,
when in the meanwhile, at 1500 hours, the
motorcar already spotted emerged, which was
stopped for the purpose of checking. The driver
of the motorcar disclosed his name as
Muhammad Yousaf, while his companion
disclosed his name as Shabir Jan Afridi. On
search of the vehicle, two packets charas pukhta
were recovered from beneath the seat of Shabir

Jan Afridi, while three packets charas pukhta
were recovered from the secret cavity made
under the driver seat. On weighment, each
packet was consisting of 1000 grams, total (05)
k.gs, whereafter, five grams each were separated
from the entire stuff (each packet), sealed into
parcels, while the remaining quantity of chars
was sealed into another parcel. On recovery of
narcotics, arrest of the accused and seizure of the
vehicle, the Seizing officer prepared the recovery
memo, Ex. PW 6/1, recorded the murasilla as
Ex. PA/1 and dispatched it to Police Station,
Machnigate, where on the basis of which FIR
No. 655 dated 30.9.2018 under section 9 ( c)
CNSA was registered against both the accused at
Police Station Machnigate.

2. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted against the
accused to the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XIII/Judge, Special Court,
Peshawar, where at the commencement of trial,
the prosecution produced as many as eight
witnesses. On close of the prosecution evidence,
accused were examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the charges,

professed innocence and stated to have falsely
been implicated in the case. They, however,
wished to produce no defence nor to examine
themselves on oath as required under section
342(2) Cr.P.C.

3. The learned trial Court, on conclusion of
the trial, convicted both the accused under
section 9 (C) CNSA and sentenced them to
undergo five (05) years RI (each) with a fine of
Rs. 50,000/- each or in default thereof to undergo
six months SI further with benefit of section
382-B Cr.P.C, vide judgment recorded on
16.7.2019.

4. The appellants, Shabir Jan Afridi and
Muhammad Yousaf, have questioned their
conviction and sentences by filing two separate
appeals bearing No. 955-P/2018 titled Shabir
Jan Afridi Vs. the State and 916-P/2018 titled
Muhammad Yousaf vs. the State. Since both
the appeals arise out of the single judgment,
therefore, these are being disposed of by way of
this single judgment.

5. Learned counsel for the appellants
submitted that the appellants are innocent and
have falsely been involved in the case. They

argued that the evidence available on record is
full of contradictions as the prosecution
witnesses have falsified each other on material
points, therefore, the impugned judgment is
based on mis-appreciation of evidence on record,
hence, the conviction and sentences recorded by
the learned trial court are liable to be set aside
and the appellants deserve acquittal.

As against that, learned AAG representing
the State argued that huge quantity of narcotics
has been recorded from the motorcar and both
the appellants were caught red-handed on the
spot. He argued that there is no reason to falsely
implicate the appellants by the police and prayed
for dismissal of the appeals.

6. We have considered the
submissions of learned counsel for the appellants
and learned AAG and have gone through the
available record.

7. It is the case of the prosecution that
on the day of occurrence, there was information
to the SHO of Police Station, Machnigate,
regarding transportation of narcotics to be
smuggled in a motorcar via Canal Road and,
hence, in the backdrop, he fenced the crime

venue and, accordingly, recovered chars,
weighing five k.gs, lying beneath the seats of
both the appellants. When examined in the Court
as PW-6, Imtiaz, the seizing officer, stated in his
examination in chief that after the recovery of
contraband, arrest of the accused and seizing the
vehicle, he drafted the Murasilla and sent it to the
Police Station concerned through constable Ijaz
No.112 for registration of the FIR alongwith the
case property (the vehicle and contraband) and
accused, but his this statement is inconsonance
with the statement of Fayaz Khan SI , who on
receipt of murasilla has incorporated its contents
into FIR, when appeared as PW-3. He stated in
his cross examination that he received only
murasilla, recovery memo and card of arrest sent
by the complainant through Ijaz, however, the
case property and accused were not handed over
to him.

Again, it is in the cross examination of
complainant Imtiaz (PW-6) that on the day of
occurrence, he left the Police Station at 06.00
a.m. He further stated that he did not say as to
whether the accused were having cell phone or
not, while Ijaz Ahmad, PW-7, stated in his cross

examination that they left the Police station at
about 01.00 p.m for patrolling on the day of
occurrence and one mobile phone was also
recovered from accused Yousaf. Likewise, there
is also contradiction in the statements of
complainant Imtiaz (PW-6) and Ijaz Ahmad, the
marginal witness (PW-7). The former stated in
his cross examination that after preparation of
recovery memo, he drafted the murasilla while
the latter stated that first of all murasilla was
drafted by the SHO/complainant.

Another damaging aspect of the case is
that during cross examination, on the request of
defence counsel, the case property was de-sealed
and the learned trial court recorded the following
observations:-

“Five packets, each wrapped in plastic coating,
were there in the parcel. Two packets were
completely wrapped in plastic coating while the
remaining three packets were in opened
condition from one corner and symptoms of
separation of some material from it were

apparent.”

Above all, Murasilla Ex PA/1 reveals that
it has been drafted at 16.20 hours, while the FIR has
been chalked at 16.45 hours. Himayatullah
Inspector, the investigating Officer of the case

(PW-5) stated in his cross examination that he
received the copy of FIR at 17.15 hours and,
thereafter, he proceeded to the spot. Ijaz Ahmad
(PW-7), who was present with the complainant at
the relevant time, stated in the first line of his cross
examination that his statement was recorded by the
I.O under section 161 Cr.P.C at 05.00 p.m, ie,
before the handing over copy of FIR to the I.0,
while the complainant Imtiaz SI stated in his cross
examination that he remained at the spot for about 1
Y% hours in respect of the whole proceedings. It may
be added that no license or ownership document has
been recovered from the accused Yousaf.

8. The discrepancies, as highlighted above, in
the testimony of prosecution witnesses cannot be
taken lightly. It is well settled principle of
administration of criminal justice that an accused is
entitled to get the benefit of slightest doubt whereas
in the case in hand, material discrepancies and doubt
are apparent on the face of the record but the learned
trial Court while delivering the impugned judgment
has failed to extend the benefit of such doubt in
favour the appellants.

6. In view of the above discussion, we have no
doubt in our mind that in the present case, the

prosecution has not been able to prove its case
against the convict-appellants beyond reasonable
doubt and, therefore, both the appeals are allowed,
resultantly, the conviction and sentences recorded by
the learned trial court are set aside and as a
consequent thereof the appellants are acquitted of
the charge levelled against them. They shall be
released forthwith if not required in any other case.

Above are the reasons of our short order of
even date
