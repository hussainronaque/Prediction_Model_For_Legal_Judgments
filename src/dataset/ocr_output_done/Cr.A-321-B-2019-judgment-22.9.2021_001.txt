JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- As per prosecution
story, on 12.08.2018, Afzal Awan Khan, SHO, Police
Station, Yaqoob Khan Shaheed, Takhat-e-Nasrati, (PW-4)
received information regarding smuggling of the narcotic
substances towards Punjab in a Motorcar, so, acting upon
such information, he along with other police party arranged
‘nakabandi’ near Naray Khawara Chowkara Qaberistanat,
when at 18.00 hours, the spotted motorcar bearing
registration No. U-8426/Karachi arrived and its search led
to the recovery of 14000 grams chars garda from its doors.
(4/4 packets from the rear doors & 3/3 packets from front
doors, total 14000 grams). The driver of the vehicle
disclosed his name as Rasheed Zaman, consequently, a
murasilla in this respect was drafted which was sent to the
Police Station, where on the basis of it, a case FIR No. 431,
dated 12.08.2018, under section 9 (c) CNSA was registered

against the accused.
02. After completion of investigation, complete challan
__ was submitted before learned Judge Special Court, Karak at
Takhat-e-Nasrati, where on the commencement of trial, the
prosecution in order to prove its case produced eight
witnesses and after closure of the prosecution evidence, the
accused was examined under section 342 Cr. P.C wherein
he pleaded innocence and stated to have falsely been
implicated in the case. However, he was neither ready to be
examined on oath under section 340(2) Cr. P.C nor wished
to produce defence. The learned trial court after hearing the
parties, convicted and sentenced the accused under section 9
(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for life and further directed to pay
fine of Rupees five lac or in default thereof to further
undergo six months SI with benefit of section 382-B Cr.
P.C, vide judgment dated 11.10.2019. It is pertinent to
mention that during interrogation/investigation appellant-
convict disclosed the names of other co-accused as Sabir-
Ur-Rehman alias Khattaki son of Badshah Khan resident of
Odin Shah Kalla, Dost Ali son of Zain Ullah, Younas Ullah
son of Piao Ullah resident of Sarki Lawaghar Tehsil Takhat-
e-Nasrati, District Karak. Amanat Ullah Khan son of
Yaristan resident of Dourwi Khel Orazaki Agency and
Amjad Ali son of Rasheed Ali resident of Khwaida Khel

Cheray Kada Bazar Orakazi Agency who being not arrested
were declared proclaimed offenders and case property was
kept intact till their arrest.

03, Rasheed Zaman alias Khattaki son of Misal Khan
Muhammad, the convict-appellant, filed the present
criminal appeal No.321-B of 2021 before this court against
his conviction and sentence.

04, Arguments heard and record perused.

05, It appears from the record that neither the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses is in tone with each
other nor the safe custody or safe transmission of the
recovered substance or the samples thereof has been
established by the prosecution. The complainant while
appearing as PW-4, though, stated in his examination in
chief that after completion of legal formalities, all these
articles, including Pakistani currency amounting to Rs.
2200/-, PSO card, driving license & Nokia Mobile were
sealed into parcel No.16 which is Ex. P2 and vehicle and
contraband were taken into possession vide recovery memo
Ex PC thereafter, murasilla (EX PA/1) was sent to the
Police Station through constable Aman Ullah (PW-6), for
registration of the FIR, yet PW-2, Islam Noor ASI, who had
incorporated the contents of murasilla into FIR Ex.PA, has
said nothing about the contraband or receipt of the samples
or its safe custody. Head Constable Aman Ullah was
examined as PW-6 and he in examination in chief too has

said nothing about sending of case property or samples
through him to the Police Station. He only deposed that he
was handed over murasilla which he has delivered to Aslam
Noor ASI. Regardless of the statement of PW-4 who
deposed that he has handed over the case property to the
Moharrir on the same day but his statement was also belied
by the record on two-fold firstly, Moharrir has not
authenticated nor even uttered a single word about the
receipt of case property from PW-4 secondly, after report he
remained at the spot for five hours, the time of crime report
was 18:40 hours where PW-4 remained for five hours i.e.,
till 23:40 hours and the distance between PS and the place
of occurrence can not be covered in less than 15 minutes
then the delivery of recovered substance or receipt thereof
on the same day i.e., 12.08.2018 in the PS was not possible.
Furthermore, complainant stayed at the spot for about five
hours after report but as per Naqalmad No. 33 he was in the
PS at 2300 hours which itself negates the version of the
complainant. During cross examination, PW-2 also
contradicted the statement of complainant by deposing that
except the murassila nothing was handed over to him. No
doubt moharrir of the Police station was examined to testify
the factum of receipt of case property or its safe custody in
the Police Station or its dispatch to the laboratory and
placed on file the copy of relevant record from register 19
Ex Pw1/1 but interestingly it bears no date of receipt of case

property. Thus, from the above discussed evidence neither
N

sending of neither the receipt of case property nor its safe
custody has been established nor there is any explanation
regarding the samples as where the same were lying during
the intervening period with specific date of receipt till
03.09.2018.

06. Likewise, the record shows that the samples of the
recovered substance had been delivered at the office of the
Chemical Examiner by Noor Afzal FC-191 on 04.09.2018
while, as per ‘rahdari receipt’, marked as Ex. PW % dated
03.09.2018, which too is doubtful because the samples were
received by him (Noor Afzal) from the Moharrir on
03.09.2018 but were delivered to the chemical examiner on
04.09.2018, though he in his examination in chief deposed
that due to protest on the issue of non-supply of gas he
proceeded to Peshawar on 04.09.2018 but in his cross
examination he said that on 03.09.2018 the said samples
and rahdari receipt was returned to the moharrir, then of
which rahdari recipt he travelled with sample to Forensic
Science Laboratory Peshawar, record is silent to this effect.
As per record the samples were collected on 12.08.2018 but
were delivered to the examiner on 04.09.2019 thus, there is
nothing on record to show the safe custody of the samples
for the period from 12.08.2018 to 04.09.2018 or its safe
transmission to the Laboratory. Hon’able the apex court of
the country has repeatedly held that the chain of custody

begins from the recovery of the seized Charas by the police
and includes the separation of the respective sample(s) of
the seized narcotics and their dispatch to the Narcotics
testing Laboratory. This chain of custody is pivotal as the
entire construction of the Act and the Rules rests on the
report of the Government Analyst, which in turn rests on the
process of sampling, and its safe and secure custody and
transmission to the laboratory. The prosecution must
establish that the chain of custody was unbroken,
unsuspicious, indubitable safe and secure. Any break in the
chain of custody or lapse in the control of possession of the
sample, will cast doubts on the safe custody and safe
transmission of the sample(s) and will impair and vitiate the
conclusiveness and reliability of the report of the
Government Analyst thus, rendering it incapable of
sustaining conviction. Rel: (2012 SCMR 577, 2015 SCMR
1002, 2018 SCMR 2039, 2019 SCMR 1217, 2019 SCMR
1300, 2019 SCMR 2004 & 2020 SCMR 687.

07. Moreover, the FSL report, marked as Ex.PK, relied
upon by the prosecution also does not contain the full
protocols of the test applied for and being unreliable cannot
be made a basis to sustain conviction and sentence of the
appellants. Now it has been declared by the august apex
court that "Protocol" means an explicit, detailed plan of an
experiment, procedure or test or a precise step-by-step
description of a test, including the listing of all necessary

reagents and all criteria and procedures for the evaluation of
the test data. Rule 6 requires that full protocols of the test
applied be part of the Report of the Government Analyst.
Every test has its protocols, which are internationally
recognized and a test without the observance of its protocols
has no sanctity. "Full Protocols" include description of each
and every step employed by the Government Analyst
through the course of conducting a test. Hence, the Report
under Rule 6 must specify every test applied for the
determination of the seized substances with the full
protocols adopted to conduct such tests and non-compliance
of Rule 6 can frustrate the purpose and object of the Act,
ie., control of production, processing and trafficking of
narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, as conviction
cannot be sustained on a Report that is inconclusive or
unreliable. The evidentiary assumption attached to a Report
of the Government Analyst under section 36(2) of the Act
underlines the statutory significance of the Report, therefore
details of the test and analysis in the shape of the protocols
applied for the test become fundamental and go to the root
of the statutory scheme. Rule 6 is therefore, in the public
interest and safeguards the rights of the parties. Any Report
(Form-II) failing to-give details of full protocols of the test
applied will be inconclusive, unreliable, suspicious and
untrustworthy and will not meet the evidentiary assumption

attached to a Report of the Government Analyst under
ames

i ade
SCANNED
05 OCT

section 36(2). Reliance: 2018 SCMR 2039, 2019 SCMR
930 and PLD 2020 SC 57.

08. So, in view of the above discussed evidence and
dictum laid down by the Hon’ble supreme Court, (supra) the
report of the Chemical Expert relied upon by the
prosecution in the instant case being inconclusive and
unreliable cannot be made a basis to sustain conviction and
sentence of the appellants. Thus, the aforesaid elements of
doubt surrounding the prosecution case have led us to an
irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has failed to
prove its case against the appellants beyond reasonable
doubt and when so, we in the interest of safe administration
of justice by giving benefit of doubt to the appellants allow
this appeal, resultantly, the impugned judgment is set aside
and, accordingly, the appellants Rasheed Zaman is acquitted
of the charge levelled against him. He be set at liberty
forthwith, if not required in any other case.

Above are the reasons of our short order of even date.
