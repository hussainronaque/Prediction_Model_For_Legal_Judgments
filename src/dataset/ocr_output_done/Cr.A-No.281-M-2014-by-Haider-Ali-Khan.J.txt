(Judicial Department)

Cr.A No, 281-M/2014
JUDGMENT

Date ofhearing: 04.11.2015

Appellant: ( State Mb y)

Respondents: _Catherwrnad haba by
HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- Impugned herein is the
judgment dated 23.7.2014 of the learned Sessions
Judge/Zilla Qazi Buner whereby the
respondent/accused was acquitted in case FIR
No. 102 dated 23.2.2013 under sections 302 PPC, 13
A.O registered at Police Station Jowar, District
Buner.

2. Precise and relevant facts of the case as
are that complainant of the case namely Bawar Khan
reported to Nazir Rehman S.1 of Police Station

Jowar on 13.2.2013 at 13:00 hours to the effect that
bo

on the day of occurrence he alongwith his brothers
and sisters were present in his home when verbal
altercation between his parents took place and in the
“Sneanwhile his father Muhammad Rehman fired with
: his pistol at his wife (mother of the complainant) as
a result whereof she was hit and died on the spot.
The incident was mentioned to have been witnessed
by the complainant and his sister Shamim Akhtar
and motive behind the offence was described as
tense family relations.

On the strength of the above report of
the complainant, Murasila Ex.PA/1 was drafted on
the basis whereof FIR Ex.PA was chalked out
against the accused Muhammad Rehman, the
respondent herein.

3. The accused was arrested © and
investigation was completed against him whereafter
complete challan was submitted by the local police

in the Court for trial of the accused. The trial Court
framed formal charge against the accused which was
denied by him instead he opted to face the trial. The
‘prosecution produced and examined eleven
‘witnesses and closed its evidence whereafter
statement of the accused under section 342, Cr.P.C
was recorded wherein he once again pleaded
innocence, however, neither he recorded any
evidence in his defence nor opted to be examined on
oath in terms of section 340 (2); Cr.P.C. After
hearing the arguments, the learned trial Court
acquitted the accused of the charge by extending
him the benefit of doubt vide judgment dated
23.7.2014. Hence the appeal in hand preferred by
the State.

4. The learned A.A.G appearing on behalf
of the State argued that the impugned judgment of
the trial Court is against the law, facts and material
on the record. He further contended that the

respondent/accused has directly been charged in the
FIR and there is no contradiction in statements of
the PWs. It was further argued that the occurrence
took place in a broad daylight and recovery of
weapon of the offence has been effected on the
pointation of the respondent/accused, The learned
A.A.G concluded that the prosecution has proved its
_ case against the respondent/accused beyond
' reasonable shadow of doubt, hence, he was not
entitled to be acquitted outrightly.

5. As against the above, learned counsel
for the respondent/accused argued that statements of
the prosecution witnesses are suffering from glaring
contradictions. He further argued that there is an
unexplained delay of five hours in lodging the FIR
and the medical report does not support the
prosecution version. The learned counsel concluded
that judgment of the learned trial Court is well
reasoned, hence, warrants no interference by this

Court,
6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record.

7. In light of the valuable assistance of the

learned counsel for the parties, perusal of the record
. would reveal that motive behind the occurrence has
y been mentioned in the FIR as strained family
relations. In this regard the complainant (PW-5) and
the eye witness (PW-6) have described different
reasons in their respective statements. Reportedly,
there was a verbal altercation between the
respondent/accused and his wife before the
occurrence as per initial report of the complainant
but there is no detail of the tense relations in the
FIR. The statements of the complainant and the eye
witness Shamim Akhtar (PW-6) recorded later on
during the prosecution evidence do not support each
other. Since, both the witnesses are the children of
the deceased and the respondent/accused, hence,

they should have better knowledge about the reasons
behind the strained relations between their parents,
therefore, their different versions in this respect are
not understandable. Thus, it is held that the

prosecution has failed to establish the motive alleged

in the report.
It is also observed that Lady Doctor
f Shah Bano (PW-7) has medically examined the
deceased and found entry and exit wounds caused by
one bullet and also found a lacerated wound on left
side of cheek caused by a sharp weapon.
; Astonishingly, there is no mention of the use of
Va sharp weapon by the respondent/accused at the time
|
of occurrence neither in the FIR nor in the
statements of the complainant and eye witness

PW-6. There is no space in the entire prosecution

story wherein the fact of wound sustained by the
deceased on her left cheek reported by the medical
report could be fitted. Thus, the medical report too

does not support the prosecution version.

9. So far recovery of the crime weapon is
concerned, the complainant reported in his initial
report recorded vide Ex.PA/1 that the
respondent/accused fled from the spot soon after the

occurrence alongwith the pistol in his hand but on

the other hand the pistol has been recovered after

-42/43 days after the occurrence and that too from the

residential room of the accused where the
occurrence took place. This fact alone is sufficient
for recording acquittal of the respondent/accused.
The prosecution has also failed to produce any
evidence to the effect that the respondent/accused
had come back to his house after the occurrence for
placing the pistol in the relevant tin box. Similarly,
the investigating officer (PW-10) has also failed to
give a satisfactory account in this regard. Therefore,
the recovery of the crime weapon through Ex.PW-

2/1 is highly doubtful.
10. In addition to the above, there is delay
of five hours in lodging the FIR which is apparent
on the face of the record whereas this delay further
extends to a period of about 22/24 hours when the
fact of developed rigor mortis on the dead body is
considered as mentioned by the lady doctor (PW-7)
in her report. She- also stated in her cross-
examination that rigor mortis usually develops after
about 24 hours depending on the climate. What
made the complainant to wait for five hours in
reporting the matter to local police? This question
has not been explained by the prosecution and as
such consultation and deliberation of the
complainant in the circumstances cannot be ruled

out.

ll It appears from the analysis of the

record that there are glaring contradictions in the
statements of the PWs on material points which have

caused serious dent in the prosecution case. Moreso,
there are also Procedural irregularities in the
investigation conducted by the LO besides the
Statements of the Prosecution witnesses and the site
plan also do not agree which create a reasonable

: a ee du

bt in a prudent mind benefit of which must go to

In view of what has been discussed

above, the learned trial Court has properly

appreciated the Prosecution evidence and the

impugned judgment, whereby the respondent/

accused has been acquitted, is based on sound

reasons hence warrants no interference by this

Court. Resultantly, the instant appeal preferred by

the State is hereby dismissed being meritless.
