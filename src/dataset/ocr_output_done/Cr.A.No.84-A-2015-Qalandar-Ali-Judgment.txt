2. The case was registered on the

report of Ashiq Hussain, SHO Police Station

City, who, reportedly, spotted the convict/

appellant making attempt to flee the spot on
the sight of police party on petrol duty at
Panj-peer Chowk, Abbottabad, at 11.30.
-hours on 30.10.2011, and after overpowering
the convict/appellant, recovered 28 ‘tokens
heroin and a plastic shopping bag also
containing -heroin, total weighing 215 grams,
as well as two slabs of ‘chars’ weighing 1010
grams from the Waist-coat and side pockets
of | the convict/appellant. The
convict/appellant was arrested, case was
registered against him and after completion
of investigation, complete challan was
submitted to the trial Court.
3. During trial, the prosecution
examined as many as five prosecution
witnesses (PWs), where-after evidence of the
prosecution was closed; and the accused was
examined under Section 342 Cr.PC, wherein,

ohe refuted allegations of the prosecution, but

declined to be examined on oath or produce
defence.

4, . Arguments of learned counsel for

" the convict/appellant and learned. State
counsel heard, and record perused.
5. . The stance of the complainant/SHO
that it was closed holiday on the eventful day,
notwithstanding, the venue shown in the site
plan is, indeed, a busy chowk wherefrom
roads lead. to bazaar (markets) and Police
Lines, which are even more overcrowded on
closed holidays. It betrays common sense
that what to speak of an ‘experienced’ person
like the convict/appellant who has, allegedly,
been indulging in such like activities in the
past, according to the police/prosecution,
even an “inexperienced first offender would
not dare to openly sell narcotics in day light
at peak rush hours in the public glare and
presence of traffic police, normally present in
the busiest chowk of the city. |
6. After the SHO P.S City combined in

\ Aimselt all the three imported roles of
f

complainant, investigating officer at the
crucial ‘initial stage and conducting almost
entire investigation in the case and exercising
~ authority to submit complete challan- against
the convict/appellant, the demand of justice
and good conscious was to view evidence
comprising testimony of the police officers,
including the SHO and his subordinates cited
as marginal witness to the recovery memo,
with greater degree of scepticism. The above
referred reason for not citing witnesses from
the general public furnished by the SHO, too,
appear far-fetched in view of location of the
spot.
7. “The learned counsel ‘for the
convict/appellant focused his arguments on
the samples of one gram from heroin
recovered from 28 “tokens and a plastic
shopping bag and 5/5 grams from the
recovered ‘chars in two slabs weighing 1010
grams. The learned counsel contended that

total of 1010 grams could not represent the
exact nature of the recovered bulk, thus
making . report of the chemical examiner
about the samples received in the FSL on the
4" day of its dispatch doubtful and not -

worthy of reliance. The learned counsel also

referred to contradictions in the statements

of the complainants/SHO (PW.4) and
marginal witness Amjad (PW.3) with regard
to the colour of the recovered heroin and
‘chars’, the former describing colour of the
heroin as off- white and that of Chars ‘as
blackish while the latter showing colour of
heroin as white; and, likewise, in the FSL
report physical appearance of the samples
shown as ‘brown powder’ and ‘brown solid’.

8. Be that as it may, the fact remains
that conviction of a 74/75 years old person
cannot be sustained merely on the basis of
testimony of police officers, who were found
to have unleashed onslaught of cases of such
like nature against the convict/appellant,

invariably ending in his acquittal , as
6

conviction of the convict/appellant not éven
‘in a single case, having been sustained, was
brought to the notice of the Court.

9. . - In the circumstances, the
conviction of the appellant and sentence -
awarded to him in the case by the learned
trial Court are not sustainable and therefore,
set aside, with the result, the appellant is
acquitted of the charges. He is on bail, and

his sureties shall stand discharged.
