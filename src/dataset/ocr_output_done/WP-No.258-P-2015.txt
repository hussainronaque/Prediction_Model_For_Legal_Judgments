QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J.- Vhis is yet another writ

petition by Amir Ghazan, petitioner, for his release in
Reference No.04/2014 filed by the National Accountability

poe ;
ES --Bureau (NAB) under section 9 of the National

4
if
_Z decountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, implicating the

petitioner as a co-accused at Sr.No.10 of the panel of
accused-persons on the charges of corruption and corrupt
practices in procurement of arms and ammunition and
other security apparatuses for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Police. The record of the case would show that the

petitioner figured in the case in the statement under section

164 Cr.P.C of the Approver in the case, Arshad Majeed,

who levelled the charge of receipt of amount of Rs.195
millions by the petitioner through his brother-in-law and
front man, Raza Ali Khan. The said Raza Ali Khan has, in
the meantime, entered into plea bargain with the NAB. The
instant writ petition of the petitioner is also, mainly, based
on the plea bargain of the said Raza Ali Khan, wherein, he
also exonerated the petitioner by saying that the petitioner
had nothing to do with the amount of Rs.195 millions as he
did not receive any monitory benefits from him in this
case. In addition to the plea bargain of the said Raza Ali
Khan, the petitioner has also moved this fresh writ petition
for bail on the grounds of delay in conclusion of trial,and
merits as well.

2. Arguments of Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah and
Barrister Syed Mudassir Amir, learned counsel for the
petitioner, and Mr.Muhammad Jamil Khan, Deputy
Prosecutor General assisted by Mr.Umar Farooq,
Additional Deputy Prosecutor General, for the NAB, were

heard and record perused.

3. It may be observed at the very outset that plea
of the petitioner for bail on merit has been rejected twice
by this Court, initially, at the pre-arrest stage and later at
the post arrest stage as well. The only development which
has taken place in the meantime and which has been
vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner
is the plea bargain of co-accused Raza Ali Khan; but the
belated summersault of Raza Ali Khan by taking the entire
blame of receiving the kick back/ commission; and,

ntriguingly, extending concession to the petitioner, his

brother-in-law, at this critical juncture when charge against
the petitioner is shortly to be framed by the trial Court,
raises many questions which cannot be resolved at the bail
stage, requiring, detailed scrutiny at the trial stage. At this
stage, the NAB have placed materials on record which,
prima facie, connect the petitioner with the offence; as, at
the relevant time, he was enjoying a special status being

brother of the sitting Chief Minister; and, certainly, in a

position to influence the award of contracts on
considerations other than merit.

4. As stated above, this Court has already
dilated upon merits of the case as well as relevant law/ case
law on the subject exhaustively, not once but twice,
leaving no room for further deliberations on merits and
law/ case law, urged once again at the bar,

5. As regards delay in conclusion of trial,

<A ~ “ssulfice it to say that apart from the obvious fact of shuttling
i

}
or the case in different Courts owing to incessant petitions

of the petitioner and the other co-accused, thus rendering

commencement of trial next to impossible, this plea of bail,
foo, was raised earlier not only by the petitioner but also
the co-accused, Malik Naveed Khan; but was not accepted
on the ground that prosecution was not responsible for the
delay, so far, rather the petitioner and co-accused are to
share the blame to greater extent.

6. Having said that, there would hardly be any

justification to admit the petitioner to bail when framing of

Pesiam se sign Oe
charge, according to the Deputy Prosecutor General for the

NAB, is scheduled within a week or so after receipt of

record by the trial Couri, lest discussion on merits of the
case prejudice case of cither of the parties.

7. This writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
