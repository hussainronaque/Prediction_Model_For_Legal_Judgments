ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, _J.- Being

unsuccessful before the two Courts below to get the
concession of bail, petitioner through this further petition
seeks the same concession from this Court in case FIR
No.802 dated 24.08.2015, registered under sections
302/324/364/148/149/34 PPC, in Police Station Tehkal,
wherein he alongwith absconding co-accused is charged
for committing the murder of Muhammad Bilal deceased,
and attempting at the lives of PWs Jehanzeb Khan and
Tanveer Abdullah.

2. On the previous date Hazrat Noor
respondent/ one of the LRs of the deceased appeared,
requested for cancellation of non-bailable warrant of arrest
issued against him and sought time to engage a counsel.
On his request warrant of arrest was cancelled and the case

was posted to 11.02.2016 with the direction to him to

engage a counsel for the date fixed, but today despite
repeated calls and sufficient wait, neither he nor any
counsel on his behalf turned up, therefore, this petition
cannot be kept pending for indefinite period and is going to
be disposed of on merits on the available record in light of
arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
State counsel.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Admittedly, none has furnished the ocular
account of murder of the deceased. It appears from the
record that on 24.08.2015 at 06.00 hours, the dead body of
the deceased was recovered by the local police from a
thoroughfare within the limits of Mandi Kalan. Nobody
identified the deceased, hence, his dead body was shifted
to KMC, for postmortem examination and murasila report
against unknown accused was drafted. On 26.08.2015 one
Jehanzeb Khan the cousin of deceased Muhammad Bilal,
recorded his statement under section 164 Cr.P.C., wherein
he deposed that on 23.08.2015 at 9.30 p.m. he alongwith
Abdullah and deceased Muhammad Bilal were on the way
to homes from Hujra when in the meantime, accused
Muhammad Fawad, Rafiad, Waqas, Muhammad Ayub and
Naeem duly armed, intercepted them, forcibly put the

deceased in the motorcar in which the petitioner was sitting

on driving seat and opened fire at them, but they luckily
escaped unhurt; that the accused abducted the deceased in
the motorcar, and later on, committed his murder. Previous
blood feud between them and the accused has been alleged
as motive behind the occurrence; that later on, they came
to know about the dead body of the deceased in KMC,
Peshawar. He charged the petitioner and above named
absconding co-accused for abduction of the deceased, his
murder as well as attempt to commit their murder.

5. Admittedly, no report has been filed by said
Jehanzeb Khan on the very first day of the alleged
abduction of the deceased and firing at them or by PW
Abdullah. No empties from the spot wherefrom the
deceased was allegedly abducted and the PWs were fired at
by the accused has been recovered. The explanation qua
non-reporting the incident furnished by PW Jehanzeb who
is 25 years old, that since their elders were not available
therefore, they were consulting them, does not seems to be
plausible and keeping in view the previous enmity between
the parties possibility of false implication of the petitioner
cannot be ruled out. As per postmortem report the cause of
death of the deceased was due to blunt trauma to his brain.
The petitioner has not confessed his guilt before the

competent Court of law nor has anything incriminating to

connect him with the commission of offence been
recovered either from his direct or indirect possession or
on his pointation. On tentative assessment of the material
available on record at the moment participation of the
petitioner in the commission of offence requires further
probe into his guilt therefore, he is entitled to concession of
bail.

6. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD concerned.
