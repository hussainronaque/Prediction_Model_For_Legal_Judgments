bill, but despite that the respondents had considerably

of the learned Consumer Court was maintained to the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad

It is apparent that the appellants have

taken a lot of measures for addressing the problem of
low gas pressure by spending millions of rupees
thereon. It is also common knowledge that our country
has been suffering from acute shortage of sources of
energy like gas, petroleum products and electricity etc.
The problem is multi-dimensional and appellants
cannot be held solely responsible for the same. The
problem is also not limited to respondents or the area
comprising of the union council to which respondents
belonged, but is a national phenomena. Appellants
have taken substantial steps in compliance with
original judgment in the case in hand and cannot be
held to have infringed rights of the
consumers/respondents, deliberately, making them
liable for imposition of the penalty under section 16 of
the Act.

6. Section 16 of the Act is penal as well as.
remedial in nature. It is penal in the sense that it
provides punishment for seven days or fine which may
extend to fifty hundred thousand rupees but not less

than ten thousand rupees, or both, in its sub-section (1),
Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-

while a punishment of rigorous imprisonment for seven —
years as well as a fine of twenty hundred thousand, but
less than ten thousand rupees, has been provided under
its sub-section (2). It is remedial in nature, because it
provides a guarantee for enforcement of protection of
the rights of consumers as well as compensating them
for the loss or damage cause to them. It also provides
for confiscation of any goods or material which is
deemed necessary for protection of the rights of
consumers as well as removal of defects of the product
involved or replacement thereof. Beside section 16, the
whole Act is remedial and a beneficial legislation.
Apart from its numerous sections, its preamble may be
referred in this regard, which read as follows;

“ Preamble... Whereas it is expedient to provide for
healthy growth of fair Preamble, commercial practice, the
Promotion and protection of legitimate interests of
consumers and speedy redressal of their complaints and
matters arising out of or connected therewith.”

There is no cavil to the maxim “actus non
facit reum nisi mens sit rea” which means that an act is
not criminal unless there is a criminal intent. ] am
conscious that the rule of criminal liability emerging
from operation of the maxim and applicable in other
cases may not be made applicable to an offence under

section 16 of the Act. Complainant or prosecution may

not be burdened to prove mens rea for proving the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-

commission of an offence under section 16 of the Act.
Remedial statues require a different treatment. “There
are many statutes” as explained by S.M. Zafar in his
book Understanding Statues, “which are both penal
and remedial, with the penal and remedial provisions
so interlocked that a separation may be impossible.
Some Courts are inclined to exercise the penal features
of statute of this type and thus subjecting to strict
construction, other Courts construe the statute as penal
statute when its remedial features are invoked. It is
suggested that the latter rule is preferable if the rule of

strict construction is to be qualified.” The subject has

been dealt with in “Maxwell on the Interpretation of
Statutes” (Twelfth Edition by P.St. J. Langan) in the

following manner;

“Where the subject-matter of the statute,” said Lord
Evershed (at p. 174), “is the regulation for the public
welfare of a particular activity. Statues regulating the
sale of food and drink are to be found among the
earliest examples. It can be and frequently has been
inferred that the legislature intended that such activities
should be carried out under conditions of strict liability.
The presumption is that the statute or statutory
instrument can be effectively enforced only if those in
charge of the relevant activities are made responsible
for seeing that they are complied with. When such a
presumption is to be inferred, it displaces the ordinary
presumption of mens area. But it is not enough merely
to label the statute as one dealing with a grave social
evil and from that to infer that strict liability was
intended, It is pertinent also to inquire whether putting
the defendant under strict liability will assist in the
enforcement of the regulations. That means that there
must be something he can do, directly or indirectly
which will promote the observance of the regulations.
Unless this is so, there is no reason in penalizing him,

Nawab (S.B.} Hon’bte Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

and it cannot be inferred that the legislature imposed
Strict liability merely in order to find a luckless victim.
According to Lord Evershed, then, two conditions must
be satisfied if the presumption as to mens rea is to be
rebutted; strict liability must be “required to give
practical effect to the legislative intention,” and the
person charged with a breach of the statutory
requirements must have had some opportunity of
furthering their observance.”

The Hon’ble Apex Court in its judgment

given in the case of “Nasir Abbas v/s The State and

another” reported as 2011 SCMR_ 1966 had held that
an act does not make a person guilty unless the mind is
also guilty and that actus reus must be accompanied by
mens rea for constituting a criminal liability except the
situation where it is a case of strict liability wherein
absence of mens rea may not be fatal to prosecution.
Relevant part of observation of the Hon’ble Apex
Court is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“The age old Latin phrase epitomizes this concept,
"actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea", which means
that the act does not make a person guilty unless the
mind be also guilty. Actus reus in simple parlance is the
actual act of committing some offence contrary to the
law of the land and mens rea is the intent to commit the
said offence. If either of the elements is missing, the
conduct would not attract a penal provision unless it is

a case of strict liability wherein the absence of mens rea
may not be fatal to the prosecution.” :

A similar view was expressed by the
Hon’ble Karachi High Court in the case of “Syeda
Waheeda Shah v/s Election Commission of Pakistan”
reported as 2013 PLD 117 by observing that absence

of proof of mens rea in offences of strict liability

Nawab {S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
~-il-

would not be , fatal to prosecution, rather only proof of

_ actus reus would be sufficient. The case in hand

would not require application of the maxim séricto

sensu but at least two conditions as explained by Lord

Evershed in the case of “Vane v/s Yiannopoullos”

reported as (1965 A.C. 486 per Lord Evershed P. 500),

must be satisfied if the presumption as to mens rea is to

be rebutted, viz,

(a) strict liability must be required to give practical
effect to the legislative intention;

(b) the person charged with a breach of the statutory
requirements must have had some opportunity of
Jurthering their observance;

In the case in hand, strict liability is very
much forthcoming from relevant provisions of the Act
but the fact that the appellants/company had the
opportunity of furthering their observance, may not be
taken to such an effect, so as to subject them to a
burden, which in the normal course of events, could
not have been discharged by them. As stated earlier,
energy crises is a national issue and its redressal by
providing gas with full pressure to the consumers, who
are respondents herein, was not readily doable for the
appellants. It is however clear from the steps which

they have taken and reproduced hereinabove that they

Nawab (S.8.} Hon'ble Mr. fustice Wigar Ahmad
-12-

have done substantial progress towards the said end
and they have also committed to be doing the same in
future on a number of occasions before the consumer
Court, as well as this Court.

7. In light of what has been discussed above,
the appeal in hand is allowed by setting aside judgment
dated 08.02.2019 of the learned Consumer Court Swat.
Appellants are however expected to keep on
implementing the main judgment and redressing
grievances of all the consumers in the area including
the respondents.
