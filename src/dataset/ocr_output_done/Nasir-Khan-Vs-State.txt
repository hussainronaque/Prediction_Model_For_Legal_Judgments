ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Naseer Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No.1617 dated
15.12.2015, registered under section 17 (3) Offences
Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance,
1979, in Police Station Pahari Pura.

2. According to version of complainant Nadir
Khan on the fateful day he having in his possession rupees
thirty lacs, when reached near the shop of one Mashoogq,
four persons present there, forcibly snatched the amount
form him at gun point and made their escape good from the
spot; that he identified one of the culprits to be Naseer
Khan (present petitioner).

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. The incident allegedly took place on
08.12.2015 in Haji Camp Adda in front of Rawalpindi Bus

Stand, Peshawar, but has been reported after a delay of six

days, for which the explanation furnished by complainant
that the elders were trying to patch up the matter between
him and the accused, disturbs a prudent mind, as in such
like incidents the first option of the victim be to rush the
Police Station for bringing the law into motion for
redressal of his grievance. No recovery of the alleged
snatched amount has been effected from the petitioner
either from his direct or indirect possession or on his
pointation nor has he confessed his guilt before the
competent Court of law. Besides, the sketch of petitioner
drawn by the local police on the pointation of the
complainant does not correspond with the features and
structure of the petitioner as manifest from his snap
annexed with the petition. During the course of arguments
learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the
amount allegedly snatched from complainant was actually
the ownership of some twenty eight peoples and he in
order to grab the same and to exonerate himself, invented a
false drama in the shape of instant case by implicating the
petitioner with whom he has got a money dispute. He also
referred a Jirga decision arrived between the petitioner and
the complainant wherein the complainant on the offer of
the Jirga members was reluctant to take Oath on the Holy

Quran regarding truthfulness of the present incident and

according to the Jirga verdict his version was held to be a
false story.

5. In view of what has been discussed above,
reasonable grounds exist which make the case of the
petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail. Resultantly, this
petition is allowed. Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail
provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and resourceful
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned.
