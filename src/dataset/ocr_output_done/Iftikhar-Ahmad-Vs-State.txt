ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, J:-_ Petitioner Iftikhar
Ahmad, seeks bail in case FIR No.23 dated 10.03.2017,
registered under section 9 (c ) Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997, (herein after referred to as the Act of
1997), in Police Station ANF RD, KP, Peshawar.

2. As per contents of FIR, on 10.03.2017 at 17.00
hours, on receipt of spy information qua trafficking of
Acetic Anhydride (a chemical used in preparation of
heroin), by Iftikhar Ahmad (present petitioner), in his
Suzuki motorcar bearing registration No.BC.8491,
Peshawar from Peshawar to Karkhano, Hafiz Sohail Umar
Gondal, Inspector ANF along with other ANF personnel,
conducted a barricade near Speen Jumat University Town
Peshawar and at 17.00 hours, intercepted the aforesaid
vehicle, being driven by the petitioner. On search, of the
car, a cane having 4.500 Kgs Acetic Anhydride were

recovered, out of which 10 Milliliter were separated for the
2

purpose of chemical analysis by the FSL. The petitioner
was arrested, hence, this case.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently
argued that the alleged recovered Acetic Anhydride is an
acid used for multiple purposes i.e. drying clothes etc and
can also be used for surfacing/polishing of heroin, hence
cannot be held as narcotics drug defined under section
2 (s) of the Act of 1997.
4. I am not impressed by the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner for the reason that section 6 of
the Act of 1997, says that no one shall produce,
manufacture, extract, prepare, possess, offer for sale, sell,
purchase, distribute, deliver on any terms whatsoever,
transport, dispatch, any narcotic drug, psychotropic
substance or controlled substance except for medical,
scientific or industrial purposes in the manner and subject
to such conditions as may be specified by or under this Act
or any other law for the time being in force. Narcotic drug
has been defined under section 2 (s) of the Act of 1997 in
the following manner:-

“Narcotic drug” means coca leaf, cannabis,

heroin, opium, poppy straw and _ all

manufactured drugs.”
Similarly, “psychotropic substance” is defined under
section 2 (za) of the Act of 1997, as under:-

“Psychotropic substance” means the

substances, specified in the Schedule to this Act
3

and such substances as the Federal Government
may, by notification in the official Gazette,
declare to be a psychotropic substance”.
According to definition of “psychotropic substance”,
psychotropic substance means the substances specified in
the Schedule to this Act and such substances as the
Federal Government may, by notification in the official
Gazettee, declare to be a psychotropic substance.

Section 2-K of the Act of 1997 defines
“Controlled substances” means any substance, which
may be used for the production or manufacture of narcotic
drugs or psychotropic substance. The recovered
contraband under the name of Acetic Anhydride falls
within the ambit of “manufacture drug” as defined
under section 2(q) of the Act, 1997 as well as notified in
the official gazette made in pursuance of the
recommendations of an International Drugs Control
Convention and incorporated in Schedule-V (Controlled
Chemicals), Division-II of Drugs of Abuse Controlled
Chemicals, Equipment and Materials) Rules, 2001.

As per scientific research the Acetic Anhydride is
the primary substance for making heroin from opium and
morphine. In view of the above, the possession of
recovered chemical i.e. Acetic anhydride being a primary
substance used for production of heroin is manifest

contravention of the provisions of section 6, punishment
4

for which has been provided under section 9 of the Act of
1997.

5. Reverting to the merit of the case, it appears from
the record that petitioner has been arrested red handed on
the spot and huge quantity of Acetic Anhydride, used in
preparation of heroin, has been recovered from the diggi
of the car which was in his explosive possession and
control. The positive FSL report and statements of the
recovery witnesses under section 161 Cr.P.C. substantiate
the version of the Seizing Officer. Nothing is on the
record to show any ill will or enmity of the of the PWs
against the petitioner. On tentative assessment of the
material discussed above, reasonable grounds exist which
prima facie connect the petitioner with the commission of
offence, hence, he is not entitled to the concession of bail.

6. Accordingly, this petition being meritless is hereby
dismissed.
