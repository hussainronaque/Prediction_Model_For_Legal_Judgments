JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, _J.-Petitioner

Jan Muhammad, seeks bail in case FIR No.484 dated
17.11.2014, registered under sections 302/34 PPC, at Police
Station Yar Hussain, District Swabi, wherein he alongwith
co-accused Akbar Ali, is charged for committing the
Qatl-e-Amd of Ghani ur Rehman deceased with firearms. It
is alleged by complainant Shakeel that as a result of firing
of the petitioner and his co-accused on Ghani ur Rehman
deceased, one Mst. Kalsoon and Hassan Ali also got hit and

succumbed to injuries, while Mst. Irum sustained firearm

injuries.
2. Arguments heard and record perused.
3. It appears from the record that the alleged

occurrence took place on 13.10.2014 in the house of

accused/petitioner Jan Muhammad, but the same has not
been reported by complainant Shaleel on the same day,
rather, the instant case has been registered on the direction
of learned Justice of Peace, on the application of
complainant filed on 21.10.2014 i.e. after eight days of the
incident, for which no plausible explanation, has been
furnished by him. There is another FIR No.440 registered
on 13.10.2014 under sections 302/324/449/100/34 PPC and
S.15 AA Police Station Yar Hussain Swabi, on the report of
Jan Muhammad (the present petitioner) wherein he charged
accused Shahid, Shah Khalid and Ghani ur Rehman
(alleged deceased of the instant case), for committing
murder of Hassan Ali, Mst. Kulsoom and attempting at his
life as well as lives of Mst. Iram and Akbar Ali, out of
whom Mst. Iram sustained firearm injuries while accused
Ghani ur Rehman (deceased of the instant case), has been
shown hit with the firing of deceased then alive Hassan Ali,
who allegedly fired at the deceased in his self defence. The
FIR mentioned above has been registered soon after the
incident within an hour and 30 minutes by present
petitioner Jan Muhammad, while the instant case has been
registered after eight days of the occurrence on the written

application of the complainant under section 22-A Cr.P.C.

The question that whether deceased Ghani ur Rehman was
done to death by the present petitioner or he met his death
in the mode and manner as_ alleged by
complainant/petitioner Jan Muhammad and whether the
present FIR has been registered just to counterblast and
damage the version of complainant Jan Muhammad in FIR
No.440, is yet to be determined during trial, after recording
evidence. Besides, the question if the local police, as
alleged by learned counsel for the complainant, was not
ready to register the report of complainant, why did not he
lodged a private complaint on the same day of occurrence
in the competent court of law, is yet to be answered during
trial. However, at the moment, all these aspects of the case,
makes the case of the accused/petitioner that of further
inquiry into his guilt, therefore, he is entitled to concession
of bail.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he furnishes

bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties

each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/

Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned. The sureties must be

local, reliable and men of means.

Announced.
