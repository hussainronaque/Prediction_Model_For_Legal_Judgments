2. Appellants faced trial in case FIR
No. 1293 (Ex.PW-4/1) dated 18.09.2017 registered
under sections 302, 34 PPC (read with section 15 A.A)
at Police Station Dagger District Buner, on the basis of
‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-6/1). ‘Murasila’ had been
incorporating report of the deceased then alive namely
Noor Zada wherein he has stated that on the day of
occurrence he started his tractor as usual, took it out of
his house and left for a market namely Hisar for the
purpose of providing services on rent. When he
reached the place of occurrence the appellants namely
Salih Muhammad alias Sawal son of Kashmalay and
Mustamir Khan alias Koka son of Salih Muhammad
residents of Bari Dara had been present there. On

seeing the complainant, the accused/appellant namely

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-3-

Koka (Mustamir Khan) started firing at him as a
result of which he received injuries on his face
and shoulders. Co-accused/co-appellant Sawal (Salih
Muhammad) was alleged to have given axe blows to
the complainant, causing him injuries on different
parts of his body. The occurrence was stated to have
been witnessed by brother of the complainant namely
Ahmad Zada and other people present there. Motive
for the occurrence was disclosed as a dispute arising
out of some loan transaction of Rs. 14,000/-. Both the
accused were charged for commission of the offence.
3. During the course of investigation, the
Investigating Officer prepared site plan Ex. PW-PB on
pointation of the eyewitness. Blood stained earth was
also recovered from the spot by Investigating Officer
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-3/1 dated 18.09.2017.
One cut finger of the deceased was also taken in
possession vide recovery memo Ex. PW-3/2 dated
18.09.2017. The Investigating Officer also took in
possession the tractor having marks of bullets (belonging
to complainant) vide recovery memo Ex. PW-3/3. Two
empty shells of 12 bore were also recovered from the
spot vide recovery memo Ex. PW-3/4 dated

18.09.2017. Weapon of offence i.e. rifle (12 bore) was

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-4-
recovered on pointation of accused Mustamir Khan
and took in possession by Investigating Officer vide
recovery memo Ex. PW-13/2 dated 21.09.2017. The
axe used in commission of the offence had also been
recovered on pointation of accused Salih Muhammad
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-13/3 dated 21.09.2017.
The weapons of offence along with other recovered
items were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory
(hereinafter referred to as “FSL”) for the purpose of
chemical analysis and comparison, wherefrom reports
Ex. PZ/1 and Ex. PZ/2 were received and placed on
file.

4. On completion of investigation in the case,
complete challan was put in Court against appellants.
Charge was framed against them on 14.11.2017, to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution was invited to produce evidence, who
accordingly examined fifteen (15) witnesses and closed
its evidence. Statements of the accused were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C. On conclusion of proceedings
in trial, accused/appellants were convicted for
commission of the offence vide judgment dated
29.07.2019 of the Court of learned Additional Sessions

Judge-II Buner, as stated earlier.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

Accused/appellants challenged __ their
conviction and sentences through the instant appeal
before this Court. While brother of deceased namely
Ahmad Zada has also filed connected Criminal
Revision No. 69-M of 2019 for enhancement of the
sentences awarded to accused/respondents.
5. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned A.A.G appearing on
behalf of State and perused the record.
6. Perusal of record reveals that mainstay of
the prosecution case has been eyewitness account of
the two eyewitnesses furnished as PW-1 and PW-2.
Dying declaration of the complainant who had also
expired later on recorded in the shape of ‘Murasila’
and exhibited as Ex. PW-6/1 in evidence, as well as
the corroboratory pieces of evidence which shall be
discussed later.
7. We first discuss evidentiary value of the
dying declaration relied upon by the prosecution. In
support of the dying declaration prosecution have been
relying upon statement of Liaqat Ali, Sub Inspector
who had recorded the dying declaration in shape of
‘Murasila’ and statement of Dr. Ihsanullah recorded as
PW-5, as well as statement of brother of the

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-6-
complainant recorded as PW-1. Prosecution have also
been relying upon the consciousness certificate
exhibited as Ex. PW-5/2 as well as report of initial
medical examination of injured by same doctor
exhibited as Ex. PW-5/1. In support thereof
Dr. Ihsanullah, Medical Officer DHQ hospital Dagger
has been examined as witness (PW-5). In his cross-
examination this witness stated that during
examination the patient was serious and in trauma. He
also admitted that certificate Ex. PW-5/2 neither bears
his signature nor his seal. The certificate Ex. PW-5/2
bears signature of a doctor but same can easily be said
to be different from the signature present on report of
medical examination of the deceased Ex. PW-5/1. The
doctor examined as PW-5 had also disowned said
signature. It has become doubtful as who had signed
the certificate Ex. PW-5/2 as a doctor. Dr. Khalid
Saleem (PW-11) had conducted postmortem
examination of the deceased. In his report of
postmortem examination he has given a long list of 10
injuries found on different parts of body of the
deceased. In internal examination it has been shown
that the scalp, skull, membrane and brain were injured.
Thoracic wall, ribs, cartilages, pleurae, right and left

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-7-
lungs and major blood vessels had also been injured.
In his cross-examination also he reiterated the same
stance vis-a-vis the injuries and stated that major
injuries had occurred to brain, lungs and associated
blood vessels. He also stated that usually a person
receiving injuries to major organs i.e. brain, lungs,
major vessels and heart etc gets unconscious. The
deceased had received numerous serious injuries on his
body as apparent from report of postmortem
examination as well as report of the doctor who had
conducted such examination. Even the doctor who was
claimed to have given consciousness certificate has
also stated that during initial examination of the patient
he had been serious and in trauma. After receiving
major injuries to brain, lungs and main vessels
associated therewith, it is hard to believe that he would
have retained his consciousness and given the
statement in as much detailed as recorded in the
‘Murasila’. Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its
judgment given in the case of Farman Ali and 3
others vs The State reported as PLD 1980 Supreme
Court 201, had doubted the making of a dying

declaration due to the serious injuries received by its

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-
maker. Relevant part of observation of the Hon’ble
Court is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“Even the dying declaration of deceased Rashid Khan
seems to be doubtful. In view of the said injuries suffered by
him; he must indeed have been in a shock if not altogether
unconscious. In fact in the cross-examination of Doctor
Hasham Daraz Khan, it is said that "the patient was not
drowsy but he used to close his eyes after sometime"
meaning thereby that he was not in full control of his
faculties. In this view, it is impossible to believe that he
could have got recorded the details of the occurrence in so
precise a manner as not even omit any of the necessary and
relevant details-such as the type of arms which each one of
the appellants was carrying; the names of the eye-witnesses;
and the name of Siddiq son of Qayyum owing to whom the
whole unfortunate episode had in the first place been
triggered.”

Laigat Ali, Sub Inspector who had
recorded the ‘Murasila’ was examined as PW-6. In his
cross-examination this witness stated that it was
correct that he had given the detail of injuries in injury
sheet and injury No. 6 had been carrying the detail,
“injury with blood on mouth”. He also admitted it
correct that the consciousness certificate Ex. PW-5/2
had not been signed by him and further added that it
had in-fact been signed by his assistant Mr. Jehanzeb
head constable. Said Jehanzeb head constable had not
been examined as witness in the trial. The
consciousness certificate had been bearing two
signatures one was that of Jehanzeb head constable
who had not been examined while the doctor had
disowned signing the certificate ever. Such facts have
rendered execution of the consciousness certificate at

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-
the time of first examination of the injured as wholly
unreliable. This witness has also stated in earlier part
of his cross-examination that the complainant had been
accompanied by his brother and other relatives at the
time he had been brought to the hospital.

8. “If a dying declaration is found to be
genuine and true” as held by the Hon’ble Lahore High
Court in its judgment given in the case of
Taj Muhammad and others v/s The State reported as
PLD 1960 Lahore 723, “ it can by itself form a
satisfactory basis for conviction. Some of the main
tests for determining the genuineness of a dying
declaration are whether intrinsically it rings true,
whether there is no chance of mistake on the part of
the dying man in identifying or naming his assailants
and whether it is free from prompting from any outside
quarter and is not inconsistent with the other evidence
and circumstances of the case. The value of a dying
declaration in each case depends on its own facts and
the circumstances in which the dying declaration was
made in relation to those facts. If a dying declaration
stands the normal tests, for judging its veracity it
becomes a wholly reliable piece of evidence, but if it
does not, it is far worse than an ordinary statement of a

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-
witness because the maker of the dying declaration
was not subjected to cross examination and was not
under an oath. If it is found that the dying man in his
statement has indulged in telling lies even partially that
would put the Courts on guard against accepting the
rest of statement without any corroboration, and the

result may well be that the whole of the statement is

”

rejected Said judgment was also subsequently

followed by this Court in its earlier judgment rendered

in the case of “Zabta Khan v/s The State” reported as

PLD 1963 (W.P.) Peshawar 66. Similarly in the case

of “Abdur Rahim v/s The State” reported as 1997 P
Cr.LJ 1274, the criteria for judging a dying declaration
was further developed and it was held;

“The site plan prepared at the instance of said Ghulam
Saeed (now dead) indicates that the distance between points
Nos. | and 3 was five single paces which comes
approximately to thirteen feet. The occurrence is stated to
have taken place at dark hours of the night and seat of
injury sustained by the deceased is on his back and in such
a situation a very serious question arises about identity of
the assailant when the doctor had too confirmed the fact
that the deceased was fired at from the back. It has been
laid down by the Superior Courts that dying declaration by
itself is sufficient to sustain conviction thereon provided the
following conditions are fulfilled:-

() Whether there was no chance of mistaken identity;
(ii) Whether deceased was capable of making statement;

(iii) After how long time after sustaining the injury the
deceased made the statement?

(iv) Whether the statement rings true?

(vy) Whether it was free from promptness of outside?

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-11-

(vi) Whether deceased was a man of questionable
character?

A dying declaration is no _ doubt
admissible under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984 but believing or disbelieving a dying
declaration has always been a question of application
of simple human judgment as held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Abdul
Razik v/s The State” reported as PLD 1965 Supreme
Court 151.

9. Nature of injuries on body of the
complainant was such as explained above that giving
of such a detailed statement by him at the time of
lodging first report of the occurrence was not found
believable. The dying declaration had not been ringing
true intrinsically. The dying declaration in the case in
hand has not at all been reliable and worthy of
credence. The factum of dying declaration could not be
proved by the prosecution. The complainant had also
been having a brother and relatives in his company and
he was also prone to tutoring and consultation. In this
regard, reliance is placed on an earlier judgment of this
Court given in the case of “Fagir Said Vs. The State
and another’ reported as 2020 YLR 1169, wherein it

has been held;

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

“Record showed that dying declaration of the deceased was
recorded in in the hospital, but that was in the presence of
eyewitness/father-in-law of deceased and it was signed by
him. Possibility of prompting and putting the names in the
mouth of the deceased then injured could not be rule out.
Dying declaring recorded in the presence of relatives was
looked into with suspicion by the Court while appraising the
same notwithstanding the condition of the deceased then
injured at the time of report.”

The dying declaration cannot therefore be
relied upon in such circumstances, and same has been
of no help to the case of prosecution.

10. The prosecution have been relying upon
statement of the two eyewitness namely Ahmad Zada
ie. brother of the complainant/deceased who was
examined as PW-1 and Haroon-ur-Rashid another
witness whose statement has been recorded as PW-2.
Ahmad Zada has stated in his statement that on the day
of occurrence he had been going to Sawari Bazar on
foot as he had been serving in a shop there. In the
meanwhile, his brother namely Noor Zada (deceased)
had passed beside him while driving his tractor, went
ahead and took a turn. The witness further stated that
as soon as his brother took the turn he heard fire shots
and thereby speeded up his pace. PW Haroon-ur-
Rashid was also stated to be going there. He then saw
the occurrence as narrated in his examination-in-chief.
This witness also stated that his brother had been fully
in senses and conscious and had reported the matter in

the hospital to the police official on duty. Motive was

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-
also stated to be a dispute over fourteen thousand
rupees. In his cross-examination the witness stated that
he had been residing in a separate house from the
deceased. This witness had suddenly happened to have
witnessed the occurrence and had been a chance
witness. “A chance witness” as held by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment rendered in

the case of Mst. Sughra Begum _and_another v/s

Qaiser Pervez_and others reported as 2015 SCMR

1142’ “in legal parlance is the one who claims that he
was present on the crime spot at the fateful time,
albeit, his presence there was a sheer chance as in the
ordinary course of business, place of residence and
normal course of events, he was not supposed to be
present on the spot but at a place where he resides,
carries on business or runs day to day life affairs”.
Relevant part of the observations in the judgment is
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“A chance witness, in legal parlance is the one who claims
that he was present on the crime spot at the fateful time,
albeit, his presence there was a sheer chance as in the
ordinary course of business, place of residence and normal
course of events, he was not supposed to be present on the
spot but at a place where he resides, carries on business or
runs day to day life affairs. It is in this context that the
testimony of chance witness, ordinarily, is not accepted
unless justifiable reasons are shown to establish his
presence at the crime scene at the relevant time. In normal
course, the presumption under the law would operate about
his absence from the crime spot. True that in rare cases, the
testimony of chance witness may be relied upon, provided
some convincing explanations appealing to prudent mind
for his presence on the crime spot are put forth, when the
occurrence took place otherwise, his testimony would fall

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

within the category of suspect evidence and cannot be
accepted without a pinch of salt.”

Similarly in the case of “Mst. Shazia
Parveen v/s The State” reported as 2014 SCMR 1197
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan had not
believed testimony of eyewitness who had failed in
establishing the reasons for their availability with
deceased at the relevant time. Relevant part of the
observations of the august Court is also reproduced
hereunder;

“It has straightway been observed by us that the incident in
issue had taken place at about 10-30 p.m. inside the house
wherein the appellant and her husband were living and no
source of light at the spot had been disclosed or shown
anywhere on the record. All the eye-witnesses produced by
the prosecution were closely related to the deceased and
they were admittedly chance witnesses who had failed to
bring anything on the record to establish the stated reason
for their availability near the deceased at the relevant time.
Such related witnesses had failed to receive any independent
corroboration inasmuch as there was no independent
evidence produced regarding the alleged motive, the alleged
recovery of a rope was legally inconsequential and the
medical evidence had gone a long way in contradicting the
eye-witnesses in many ways. The duration of the injuries
and death recorded by the doctor in the Post-mortem
Examination Report had rendered the time of death alleged
by the eye-witnesses quite doubtful, the stomach contents
belied the eye-witnesses regarding the time of occurrence
and the negative report of the Chemical Examiner showed
that no poison or intoxicant had been detected inside the
body of the deceased which squarely contradicted the eye-
witnesses. In these circumstances it could not have been
held by the learned courts below that the prosecution had
succeeded in establishing the appellant's guilt beyond
reasonable doubt.”

The witness i.e. PW-1 has though stated
that he had been serving in a shop and had been going
to Sawari Bazar on foot but such an explanation is not

sufficient to fully establish presence of the witness at

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-
the scene of crime, right at the time of commission of
the offence. It is also unnatural that this witness had
been going on foot while his brother had been driving
a tractor to same destination, then neither the brother
had asked the witness to board the tractor nor had he
boarded the same. The explanation given by this witness
was not found believable. The witness had also been
closely related to the deceased being his brother and had
also been an interested witness. In the case of Mst.
Shazia Parveen Supra one of the reasons for discarding
testimony of the eyewitnesses was that they had been
related (as well as chance) witnesses. The other witness
namely Haroon-ur-Rashid examined as PW-2 has also
given a similar narration stating therein that he had
also been going to Bazar for purchasing vegetables
when the deceased Noor Zada, while driving the
tractor, had passed through him and took a turn.
Thereafter he heard the report of fire shots and rushed
towards the spot where he witnessed the occurrence.
This witness has not stated that the other PW ie.
Ahmad Zada had also been present at the time of
occurrence and witnessed the crime. In the start of his
cross-examination, the witness has stated that he had
been living with the complainant Noor Zada ete for 53
years. This witness had though not been directly

related to the complainant or the other PW but he had

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-16-
been unmarried person and living with them for
53 years. As such this witness had not been having the
character of fully independent witness. This witness
had not been specifically named in the FIR to have
seen the occurrence. He is also a chance witness as he
had also reached the place of occurrence per chance.
He could not satisfactorily explain the reason of his
presence at the spot at the time of commission of the
offence.

11. The story narrated by both these
two PWs has _ also been strikingly similar to the
extent that both of them have stated that they
had been going to Bazar on foot when the
deceased then alive crossed them while driving his
tractor, took a turn, the fire started, they immediately
rushed towards the spot and then witnessed the
occurrence. Narration of the story depicts a cyclostyle
narration and cannot be termed as a natural narration
of the witnesses who had seen the occurrence.
Presence of both the witnesses is not believable at the
spot. Their testimonies cannot therefore safely be
relied upon for convicting the appellants on a capital
charge.

12. So far as corroboratory evidence of the
recovery of axe on pointation of one appellant namely

Salih Muhammad alias Sawal is concerned, it is

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-17-

important to note that conviction may not solely be
based upon corroboratory evidence. Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan while giving its judgment in the case
of “Muhammad Afzal alias Abdullah_and others vs.
The State and others” reported as 2009 SCMR 639
has also expressed almost a similar view in para-12 of
its judgment, which is reproduced hereunder for ready
reference;

“After taking out from consideration the ocular evidence,
the evidence of identification and the medical evidence, we
are left with the evidence of recoveries only, which being
purely corroboratory in nature, in our view, alone is not
capable to bring home charge against the appellant in the
absence of any direct evidence because it is well-settled that
unless direct or substantive evidence is available conviction
cannot be recorded on the basis of any other type of
evidence howsoever, convincing it may be.”

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its

judgment rendered in the case of “Imran Ashraf & 7
others v/s The State” reported as 2001 SCMR 424, has
also observed;
“Recovery of incriminating articles is used for the
purpose of providing corroboration to the ocular
testimony. Ocular evidence and recoveries, therefore,
are to be considered simultaneously in order to reach
for a just conclusion."

In support of same ratio, further reliance
may also be placed on the judgment reported as
2007 SCMR_ 1427. When prosecution has failed to
prove case against the appellants beyond reasonable

doubt then the corroboratory evidence produced in the

case could not be considered in isolation for convicting

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-18-
an accused. Besides, it is also very strange to note that
the axe had been shown recovered from a field where
the appellant namely Salih Muhammad alias Sawal
had concealed it in bushes. The recovery has been
effected after three days of the occurrence, but same
had been shown to be containing blood in such
quantity that it had been found sufficient for blood
grouping as the FSL report Ex. PZ-2 had been showing
that it had been containing human blood and of the
same group and matching with blood group found on
the blood stained earth and blood stained shirt of the
deceased. Likewise, the recovery of rifle on pointation
of the appellant namely Mustamir Khan alias Koka
(from his landed property) had also been found
doubtful for the reason that according to marginal
witness of the recovery memo Ex. PW-13/2 the place
of recovery could be covered within 05/10 minutes
from the main road. The recovery has been effected
after three days of the occurrence then how was it
possible that the rifle had been lying in open field for
long three days and same had not been spotted by
anyone. Therefore, such recoveries and FSL reports
had not been free from doubts as well. “Benefit of
even a single doubt is to be extended to the accused
wherever reasonably found in case of prosecution”, as
held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “ Mst.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-19-

Asia Bibi v/s The State and others” reported as PLD

2019 Supreme Court 64.

13. In light of what has been discussed
above, the instant appeal is allowed as the prosecution
have not been able to bring home guilt of the
accused/appellants. Judgment dated 20.07.2019 of the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge-II Buner
impugned herein is set aside. Both the appellants are
acquitted of the charges by extending them benefit of
doubt. They be released forthwith if not required in
any other case. Since accused/appellants have been
acquitted of the charges while allowing criminal
appeal No. 353-M of 2019, therefore connected
criminal revision No. 69-M of 2019 has become
infructuous and same is accordingly dismissed.

14. These are reasons for our short order of
even date.
