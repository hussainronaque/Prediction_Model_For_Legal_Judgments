28 HR OR

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This judgment shall dispose

of two appeals bearing Cr.A. No.46-D/2014 titled Mira
Jan Vs. Mir Abbas, etc and Cr.A. No.50-D/2014, titled
State through Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Vs. Mir Abbas, as both the matters have sprung out from
one and the same judgment dated 12.8.2014, passed by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan,
whereby the respondents-accused were acquitted of the
charges in case FIR No.582 dated 14.12.2011, registered
under Sections 302/427/34 PPC at Police Station Saddar,
District D.I.Khan.

2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the

FIR, in brief, is that on 14.12.2011 at 1445 hours,
-2-

appellant-complainant Mira Jan (PW-10), made report to
Rehmatullah ASI, Incharge Reporting Centre, DHQ
Hospital, D.I.Khan (PW-9), to the effect that his brother
Sarwar Jan was driver of Datsun bearing registration
No.2353/SGG, owned by Al-Hamd Fruit Commission
Shop New Fruit And Vegetable Market and used to
reside in New Fruit And Vegetable Market; that on the
day of occurrence he alongwith his brother Sarwar Jan
boarded in the aforesaid Datsun and were coming back
to New Vegetable Market after dropping the owners of
Al-Hamd Commission Shop, namely Aurganzeb,
Tanvir, Sajjad, Abid and Safeer; complainant was seated
in front seat of the Datsun while his brother was driving
the vehicle; that at about 0215 hours, when they reached
at Niazi Chowk, Sheikh Yousaf, accused Mir Abbas and
Usman made Lalkara and Mir Abbas fired at his brother
by firearm, as a result thereof his brother got hit and died
on the spot while the Datsun was also damaged.
Accused after the commission of offence succeeded to
flee from the spot. Motive for the offence was stated to
be illicit relations of the deceased with the wife of
accused Mir Abbas. On this report, PW-9 drafted
murasila Ex. PW 9/1 and sent the same to police station
where Ghulam Farid ASI (PW-5) registered the case

against the respondents-accused vide FIR Ex. PA.

3. After completion of the usual investigation,
complete challan under Section 173, Cr.P.C. was
submitted in the trial Court against the respondents-
accused. After compliance of provision of Section 265-
C, Cr.P.C, charge was framed against the accused to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as
ten (10) witnesses. After ‘closure of prosecution
evidence, the accused were examined under Section 342,
Cr.P.C, wherein, they denied the allegations and
professed innocence, however, they neither opted to be
examined on oath, nor produced evidence in their
defence. The learned trial Court, after hearing arguments
from both the sides, acquitted the accused-respondents
of the charges vide impugned judgment dated 12.8.2014,
hence this appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record gone through.
5. It is the case of prosecution that on the day
of occurrence after dropping the owners of Al-Hamd
Commission Shop, namely Aurganzeb, Tanvir, Sajjad,
Abid and Safeer; Mir Jan complainant (PW-10) was
seated in front seat of the Datsun, whereas his brother
(now deceased) was driving the vehicle and at about
0215 hours, when they reached at Niazi Chowk, Sheikh
Yousaf, accused Mir Abbas and Usman made Lalkara,

and Mir Abbas fired at his brother through firearm,
-4-

which hit his brother who died on the spot while the
Datsun was also damaged. The report in the present case
was made at 2:45 p.m, i.e. within thirty minutes of the
occurrence. Complainant PW-10 stated that after the
occurrence he shifted the dead body of deceased in
Chingchi Rickshaw, but during cross-examination, he
deposed that “As soon as I reached the hospital the dead
body of my brother was shifted towards the doctor, there
after I lodged the report in the hospital’. This clearly
shows that neither he witnessed the occurrence, nor the
dead body of deceased was shifted by him to the
hospital. Similarly, PW-10 deposed that on the day of
occurrence, he came to D.I.Khan to deliver clothes to his
deceased brother and according to him the clothes were
lying in the vehicle in question, but the record transpired
that those clothes were neither recovered by the
police/l.O, nor handed over to police in order to
establish presence of the complainant PW-10 on the spot
at the time of occurrence. In the FIR, PW-10 mentioned
the weapon of offence as firearm, despite the fact that as
per site plan, the accused were at a close distance from
where the alleged weapon of offence could easily be
identified. Needless to say that after recovery of 30 bore
empty, specification of weapon of offence was
mentioned in the site plan to be 30 bore pistol.

Besides this, the prosecution has also not cited as
-5-

witnesses the owners of Al-Hamd Fruit Commission
Shop namely Aurangzeb, Tanvir, Sajjad, Abid and
Safeer to corroborate the version of complainant PW-10,
as mentioned in the first information report.

6. According to site plan Ex. PW 6/l,
prepared by Gul Marjan ASI (PW-6), accused Mir
Abbas, who was charged for fatal injury, is mentioned at
point No.3 and the deceased is shown at point No.1,
whereas presence of complainant is indicated at point
No.2. The place of presence of accused at point No.3 is
almost in the same line as compared to place of the
deceased at point No.1 and place of presence of
complainant at point No.3. According to postmortem
report, the deceased sustained single injury on the back
of right side of the head with an exit wound through
internal meatus of left ear. Keeping in view the points
assigned to the deceased and the complainant mentioned
in the site plan Ex. PW 6/1 and direction of the injury
sustained by the deceased, as observed by Dr.
Naimatullah Khan (PW-3), the complainant should not
have escaped from the exit bullet. Needless to mention,
that why the accused spared the complainant by not
repeating the fire shot for becoming an eyewitness of the
occurrence. According to recovery memo Ex. PW 4/1,
Gul Marjan ASI (PW-6) recovered an empty of 30 bore

Ex.P-3, giving fresh smell, from the place of accused
-6-

Mir Abbas, whereas complainant PW-10 stated during
cross-examination that he handed over the empty to the
police on the spot which he took from the seat of
vehicle. In view of above glaring infirmities surfacing in
the prosecution story, particularly in the statement of
alleged eyewitness complainant PW-10, his presence
was rightly disbelieved by the learned trial Court. In the
case reported as Bagh Ali Vs. State (PLD 1973 S.C.
321), it was observed that the appraisement of the
evidence of eyewitnesses has to be based upon a full
consideration and evaluation of all the circumstances
appearing in the case where there is fatal absence of
physical circumstances to connect the accused person
with the crime and there is a motive and in such a
situation, the ocular evidence must, in order to carry
conviction on a capital charge, come from un-
impeachable source and if such source is not available,
then it must be supported by some strong circumstance
which would enable the court to overcome the inherent
doubt which such evidence must necessarily create.

7. There is no two opinion about the fact that
the cardinal principle of justice always laid emphasis on
the quality of evidence which must be of first degree and
sufficient enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court
with regard to the implication of innocent persons

alongwith guilty one by the prosecution, otherwise, the
-7-

golden principle of justice would come into play that
even a single doubt if found reasonable would be
sufficient to acquit the accused, giving him/them benefit
of doubt because bundle of doubts are not required to
extend the legal benefit to the accused. In this regard,
reliance is placed on a view held by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in the case of "Riaz Masih alias Mithoo

Vs. State (NLR 1995 Cr.SC 694).

8. Regarding the golden principle of benefit
of doubt, reference can be made to the celebrated

judgment of the apex Court title "Muhammad Lugman

Vs. The State (1970 PLD S.C.-10), where the Hon'ble

Bench have observed that:-

"It may be said that a finding of guilt
against an accused person cannot be
based merely on the high probabilities
that may be inferred from evidence in a
given case. The finding as regards his
guilt should be rested surely and firmly
on the evidence produced in the case and
the plain inferences of guilt that may
irresistibly be drawn from that evidence.
Mere conjectures and probabilities cannot
take the place of proof. If a case where to
be decided merely on high probabilities
regarding the existence of non-existence
of a fact to prove the guilt of a person, the
golden rule of "benefit of doubt" to an
accused person, which has been a
dominant feature of the administration of
criminal justice in this country with the
consistent approval of the superior
Courts, will be reduced to a naught".

The dicta laid down in the above precedent

has been re-enforced by the august Supreme Court in the

-8-

cases of Tariq Parvez Vs. The State (1995 SCMR-
1345), Muhammad Khan and another Vs. The State
(1999 SCMR-1220) and Muhammad Akram Vs. The
State (2009 SCMR-230).

9. Keeping in view the above infirmities in
the prosecution case, motive as alleged, was of no use to
the prosecution.

10. Adverting to abscondence of the accused,
it is not denied that abscondence alone cannot be a
substitute for real evidence because people do abscond
though falsely charged in order to save themselves from
agony of protracted trial and also to avoid duress and
torture at the hands of police. In the instant case,
abscondence is meaningless because it can neither
remove defects of the oral evidence, nor is by itself
sufficient to bring guilt home to the accused. In this
respect, we are fortified by the judgments reported as
Niaz Muhammad alias Niazi Vs. The State (1996
P.Cr.L.J 394), Muhammad Khan and another Vs. the
State (1999 SCMR 1220), Mehr Khan and another
Vs. The State (PLD 1977 SC 41) and State Vs.

Iftikhar (2002 MLD Peshawar 347).

11. It is now settled that standards of assessing
evidence in appeal against acquittal are quite different
from those laid down from appeal against conviction.

There is a marked difference between appraisement of
-9-

evidence in the appeal against conviction and in the
appeal against acquittal. In the appeal against conviction,
appraisal of evidence is done strictly and in appeal
against acquittal, the same rigid method of appraisement
is not to be applied as there is already finding of
acquittal given by the trial Court after proper analysis of
evidence on record. In the appeal against acquittal,
interference is made only when it appears that there has
been gross misreading of evidence which amounts to
miscarriage of justice. The ordinary scope of appeal
against acquittal of accused-respondents is considered
narrow and limited, as held by the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan, in a chain of consistent judgments. In this

behalf, reference may be made to the cases, reported as

Muhammad Usman and 2 others Vs. The State (1992
SCMR 498) and The State Vs. Muhammad Sharif
and others (1995 SCMR 6335).

12. The result of the above discussion is that
there are inherent infirmities in the prosecution case and
it appears that the occurrence has not taken place in the
mode and manner as stated by the prosecution; so we are
of the firm view that the trial Court has rightly extended
the benefit of doubt to the accused on valid and cogent
reasons by correctly appreciating the evidence on record
and acquittal of the accused-respondents did not call for

any interference by this Court, therefore, the judgment
-10-

passed by the learned trial Court is upheld.

Consequently, both the appeals, being devoid of merits,

are hereby dismissed.

Announced.
