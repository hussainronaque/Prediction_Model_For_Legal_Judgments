SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This petition has
been moved by Muhammad Rizwan,
complainant, for cancellation of post arrest
bail granted to accused-respondent Gulfam in
Crime No. 162 dated 07.08.2019 registered
under Sections 324 / 334 / 34 PPC read with
Section 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms
Act, 2013 at Police Station Kaghan.

2. The allegation against the accused-
respondent is that on 07.08.2019 at 19:30
hours he alongwith his co-accused fired at the
complainant party, as a result of which,
Naseem and Ashfaq sustained bullet injuries
and left leg of Ashfaq was amputed. Vide
order dated 10.10.2019 respondent was
allowed post arrest bail by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge Balakot, hence,

this petition.
3. | have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and gone through the
record.

4. It is a matter of great concern and |
regret to know that in this case the learned
Additional Sessions Judge Balakot, while
granting post arrest bail, failed to apply his
own independent mind to the facts of the case
and without discussing the material on the
record and pleas of the parties, straightaway
granted post arrest bail to the respondent with
the following observations: -

‘From the arguments of the
respective learned counsels for
the petitioner and respondent
No.2 and the perusal of the
record it transpires that this
case is fit for further inquiry.
There is no dearth of questions
in this case begging for
answers, which will come when
trial will be concluded which will
take time and till then the
petitioner cannot be left to
suffer behind the bars. Thus,
this post arrest bail petition is
hereby accepted whereby the
petitioner is granted bail
provided that he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum _ of
Rs.100,000// (one hundred
thousand) with two sureties

each in the like amount subject

to the satisfaction of this court.

The sureties shall be local,

reliable ad men of means.”
5. When the learned counsel for the
accused-respondent was confronted with the
bail granting order, he too admitted that the
learned Additional Sessions Judge Balakot
without adhering to the pre-conditions laid
down by the superior courts of Pakistan for
grant of post arrest bail or the provisions
contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 497
Cr.P.C granted post arrest bail to the
respondent. Such a course, adopted by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge, miserably
falls short of judicious adjudication. In the
instant case, the respondent and his co-
accused have specifically been charged in the
crime report for causing bullet injuries to
brothers of the complainant namely, Naseem
and Ashfaq. It was specifically stated in the
crime report that due to fire shots of accused
Gulfam, Naseem sustained bullet injuries on
different parts of his body and from the fire
shots of accused Gul Shan, his second

brother Ashfaq sustained injuries and
resultantly his left foot was amputed. The
medico-legal report fully supports the version
of the complainant. The occurrence was also
witnessed by the neutral witnesses. The injury
sustained by injured Naseem is on vital part
of his body. After the occurrence, the
respondent decamped from the spot and at
the time of arrest a 12-bore rifle was
recovered from his personal possession and it
was sent to the FSL alongwith the crime
empties, recovered from the spot, its report
was received in positive.

6. Perusal of the impugned order reflects
that it is not a speaking order. No doubt, the
courts are always slow to cancel bail, already
granted by the courts of competent
jurisdiction, however, if proper grounds do not
exist, then the bail is liable to be cancelled.
The impugned order by its nature appears to
be perfunctory and also lack of reasons,
therefore, on no conceivable principle, such a
slipshod order can be sustained. There is
substance in the contentions of learned
counsel for the petitioner.

7. For what has been discussed

hereinabove, this petition is allowed and the
bail granting order of the learned lower court
dated 10.10.2019 is set-aside and the
accused-respondent, present in court, is
directed to be taken into custody and sent to
the judicial lock up forthwith.

Above are the detailed reasons for
short order of the even date.

Announced:
27.02.2020.
