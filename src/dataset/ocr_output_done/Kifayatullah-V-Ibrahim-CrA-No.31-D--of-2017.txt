Cr.A. No.31-D/2017.

Vs.
Ibrahim, etc.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 18.8.2017.

Appellant-Petitioner by Mr. Muhammad Waheed
Anjum Advocate.

Respondent State.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J. Through instant criminal
appeal No.31-D/2017, filed under section 417(2-A),
Cr.P.C, the appellant Kifayat- Ullah has assailed the
judgment dated 29.11.2017 passed by the learned
Resident Judicial Magistrate, Daraban, D.I.Khan,
whereby the accused-respondent was acquitted of
the charges.

2. Precise facts of the case, out of which
the present appeal arises, are that the appellant is the
owner of landed property 30 kanals in Khasra
No.1609/1438 and the accused is his tenant and used
to cultivate his land for the crop of Rabie 2015. In

Khasra No.1609/1438, a ban was imposed by the

Kifayat/*

Deputy Commissioner, D.I.Khan, under Section
144, Cr.P.C. vide his letter dated 15.5.2015,
restraining the tenant from removing or causing to
remove any Rabie harvest, 2015 from the threshing
floor unless he has delivered his due share of
produce of Rabie Harvest 2015 according to Rewaj
of the landlord, but despite ban the accused cut the
crop and violated the conditions imposed by the
Deputy Commissioner. Therefore, on the report of
appellant/complainant, a case FIR No.134 dated
01.8.2015, under Section 188 PPC was registered at
police station Daraban, D.I.Khan.

3. After completion of investigation, the
case was put to trial, the accused was formally
charged to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as six witnesses. At the
conclusion of trial, vide judgment dated 29.11.2016,
the accused was acquitted by the learned Resident
Judicial Magistrate, D.I.Khan. Not contented with
the same, the complainant has filed the instant
appeal.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant
argued that the accused had cut the crop during the

ban imposed by the Deputy Commissioner, which
Kifayat/*

was imposed in exercise of powers conferred under
Section 144, Cr.P.C, therefore, acquittal order
passed by the learned Resident Judicial Magistrate,
suffers from legal infirmity. He further submitted
that the prosecution has proved its case against the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, the
impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of the record reveals that the
ban was imposed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. by the
Deputy Commissioner, D.I.Khan vide letter dated
15.5.2015, but in the instant case, admittedly, the
complaint was filed and the report was lodged by
the appellant instead of Deputy Commissioner.

7. A bare reading of Section 195(1)(a),
Cr.PC, reveals that no Court can take cognizance of
the offence punishable under Section 188 PPC,
except on the complaint as defined under Section
4(h), Cr.P.C. of the Public Servant, who
promulgated Section 144, Cr.P.C, the present FIR
was not lodged by the concerned District Magistrate.
8. In case of violation of the order passed
by District Magistrate within the meaning of Section
144, Cr.P.C. the machinery of law can only be

moved by filing complaint by order of such public
Kifayat/*

servant who promulgated the real order or by his
superior, as envisaged under Section 195(1)(a),
Cr.P.C. In the present case, there ought to have been
a complaint as envisaged under Section 4(h) Cr.P.C.
by District Magistrate himself or his superior i.e.
Home Secretary and under no circumstances by a
private person who is landlord of the accused,
therefore, the accused was rightly acquitted by the
learned Resident Judicial Magistrate.

9. For what has been discussed above, I
found no illegality or jurisdictional defect in the
impugned judgment, rather it has been passed in
accordance with law. The appeal, being bereft of
substance and merit, is hereby dismissed in /imine.

Announced.
