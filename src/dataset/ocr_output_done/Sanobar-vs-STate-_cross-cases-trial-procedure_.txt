All the sentences have been directed to
run concurrently and benefit of section 382-B

Cr.P.C. has been extended to them.

2. Through the instant appeal, the appellants have
questioned their convictions and sentences, whereas,
Ikhtiar son of Sherin Khan, petitioner has filed
Crl. Revision Petition No.64-P/2015, for enhancement of
sentences of convicts-respondents.

3. As both, the appeal and revision petition are the
outcome of one and the same judgment of the learned Trial
Court dated 07.05.2015, therefore, are being decided
through this single judgment.

4. As per contents of FIR, on 10.06.2013 at 09.45
hours, complainant Ikhtiar in injured condition, while
reporting to local police in Casualty of Lady Reading
Hospital (LRH), Peshawar, stated that on the fateful day
he along with Gul Muhammad, Amjid, Sherin and Noroz
Khan, was present at the spot when in the meantime, the
appellants-convicts along with co-accused Zahoor and
Muhammad, duly armed with deadly weapons, arrived
there and on the command of accused Hashmat,
co-accused named above, opened fire at them, as a result,
Amjid got hit and died on the spot, while he and PW Gul

Muhammad, sustained firearm injures. His report was
incorporated in the shape of Murasila, on the basis of
which, FIR No.522 dated 10.06.2013 under sections
302/324/148/149 PPC, was registered against the
appellants and co-accused in Police Station Badh Ber
Peshawar.

5. On arrest of the appellants-convicts and
completion of investigation, challan was submitted against
them before the learned trial Court, where they were tried
and ultimately convicted and sentenced as mentioned
above.

6. During the course of arguments it revealed from
the record that about the same incident, another FIR
No.523 dated 10.06.2013, under sections 324/34 PPC, has
also been registered on the report of one Hashmat i.e. one
of the appellants. In the cited FIR, complainant party of the
instant case has been nominated as accused. If both the
FIRs are taken in juxtaposition, the date and place of
occurrence as well as parties are the same with slight
variation in the time of occurrence. The scriber in
foot-notes of the Murasila in case FIR No.123, has
endorsed that it is a cross case to FIR No.522 dated
10.06.2013, under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC, PS
Badh Ber, Peshawar. Besides, murasila of both the FIRs
(ibid), have been drafted by one and the same author/ASI
in LRH Peshawar. Factum of case FIR No.523 to be a

cross case to FIR No.522, is also apparent from order dated
24.01.2015 of the learned trial Court, wherein request of
the appellants with regard to requisitioning of record of
FIR No.523, had been acceded to and the office was
directed to requisition record of the said case, however, the
trial of both the cases were not conducted side by side.
Findings of the learned trial Court that FIR No.523, is not
a cross case to FIR No.522, without recording evidence in
FIR No.523, are based on the sole ground that time of
occurrence in the two FIRs varies from each other. As
stated earlier, the date and place of occurrence as well as
parties in both the FIR are the same, therefore, mere slight
variation in the time of occurrence could not be a
convincing ground for forming an opinion that the cases
are not cross. Trial in both the cases should have been
conducted side by side by the learned trial Court, as in
such like cases, the prime question is the determination of
aggressor and aggressed upon. Such question cannot be
determined without analysis of the evidence of both the
cases. The learned trial Court without conducting trial in
case FIR No.523 dated 10.06.2013 under sections 324/34
PPC, Police Station Badh Ber, Peshawar, in a haphazard
manner dealt with the trial of the appellants and recorded
their conviction and sentences, which exercise undertaken
by the learned trial Court is against the general practice in
cases of counter versions. True that the Code of Criminal

Procedure is silent with regard to procedure to be adopted
in the trial of counter-cases, arising out of the same
incident and it has not been laid down anywhere in the
Code of Criminal Procedure as an absolute rule that all
charges and counter charges must be tried by the same
Court, however, it is a salutary practice that when two
criminal cases relate to the same incident, they are to be
tried and disposed of by the same Court by pronouncing
judgments on the same day. The two different versions of
the same incident, resulting in two criminal cases, are
compendiously called “case and counter case” or “cross
cases”. We think that the fair procedure which should
have been adopted was that the trial Court should have
conducted trial in both cases side by side. The practical
reasons for adopting such procedure is nothing but to
staves off the danger of an accused being convicted before
his whole case is before the Court; to deter conflicting
judgments being delivered upon similar facts and in reality
the case and the counter case are to all intents and purposes
different or conflicting versions of one incident and finally
to determine the question as to who was the aggressor and
who was aggressed upon.

7. For the reasons discussed above, we dispose of this
appeal in the manner that the impugned judgment of the
learned trial Court is set aside and the case is remanded to
the Trial Court for decision afresh, after conclusion of trial

in the cross case FIR No.523 (supra). The learned trial
Court shall on conclusion of trial in case FIR No.523 and
hearing the arguments of parties, shall pronounce
judgments in both the cases simultaneously. Since,
appellant Hashmat, was on bail during trial, therefore, on
remand of the case he shall be released on bail on the
already existing bail bonds, — whereas, co-
accused/appellants shall remain as under trial prisoners. On
disposal of the appeal, the connected Cr.R. Petition
No.64-P/2015, has become infructuous, which is hereby
dismissed. Record of the case be sent to the learned trial
Court immediately.
