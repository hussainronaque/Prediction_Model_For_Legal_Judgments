SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Having been booked in
case FIR No.100 dated 12.04.2021, registered under scctions
496-A, 452, 506, 376 of Pakistan Penal Code at Police Station
Kirri Khaisore, District D.I.Khan, the accused/petitioner afier his
arrest applied for bail before the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III, D.I.Khan, which was declined vide order
dated 04.5.2021, feeling aggrieved therefrom, the petitioner

approached this Court through the instant bail petition.

2. The prosecution story as divulged from the first
information report (F.LR.) is that, on 12.4.2021 at 08:50 hours,
complainant Muhammad Ramzan reported the matter in
Police Station Kirri Khaisore to the effect that on 11.4.2021, he

was out of his house to reap wheat crcps when he reccived a cell
-2-

phone call ftom his brother Zeeshan that his wife and daughter
were missing from their house, upon which he immediately
reached to his house and on search it revealed to him that at
12:00, noon accused/petitioner Din Muhammad, in connivance
with co-accused Habib-ur-Rehman, enticed away his wife for the
commission of illicit intercourse. Initially, he tried to settle the
matter through elders of the locality but in vain, hence, the FIR

(ibid).

3. Today, the complainant appeared before the Court
and stated that he does not want to engage counsel as according
to him he has patched up the matter with the accused/petitioncr,
hence, arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and the
learned Asstt: A.G. heard and with their valuable assistance the

record was gone through.

4, The record transpires that the occurrence allegedly
took place on 11.4.2021 at 12:00 hours, whereas the report was
lodged by the complainant on 12.4.2021 at 08:30 hours, while
the abductee was recovered from her house on 12.4.2021 i.e. on
the date when the matter was reported to police, but the abductee
did not accompany the complainant to police station for lodging
the FIR. It is yet to be established at trial that when the abductee

was available in her house on the date when the FIR was lodged
=
by her father, then why she did not report the matter herself,

rather on the said date, she recorded her 164, Cr.P.C. before the
Court of Judicial Magistrate. On perusal of statement of the
abductee recorded under section 164, Cr.P.C. the question arises
that why she did not make hue and cry at the time of occurrence,
rather she stated that after commission of the offence the accused
let her free, whereafter, she called the peoples working in the
nearby fields. Had she made hue and cry, the people working in
the nearby fields would have attracted to the spot to rescue her.
The above questions cannot be answered without recording pro
and contra evidence which is the job of trial Court. The
statements of alleged eyewitnesses namely, Muhammad Imran
and Muhammad Mushtaq, recorded under Section 161, Cr.P.C.
cannot be taken into consideration at this stage for the reason
that the victim while recording her 164, Cr.P.C. statement did
not disclose that the occurrence was witnessed by them, hence,
the question whether the above-named persons had witnessed the

occurrence or otherwise would be answered at the time of trial.

5. So far as heinousness of the offences and
prohibition is concerned, it is now well settled that there is no
legal or moral compulsion to keep an accused in jail on mere
allegations, unless reasonable grounds do exist to believe that

the accused is prima facie connected with the commission of
-4-

offence. Needless to say that ultimate conviction and
incarceration of a guilty person can repair the wrong caused
by a mistaken relief of bail, but no satisfactory reparation can
be offered to an innocent man for kis unjustified incarceration
at any stage of the case albeit his acquittal in the long run, as

held by the by the apex Court in case titled “Zaigham Ashraf

Vs the State and others’ (2016 SCMR 18).

6. Besides the above, while perusing the medico legal
report of the victim, it transpires that the same does not support
the allegations contained in the FIR for the reason that the
concerned doctor did not notice any scratch mark on perineum or;
other body parts nor any opinion was given with regard to
commission of fresh intercourse, rather 14 weeks pregnancy was

noticed.

7. True, that while seized of a bail matter, the Court
is to make tentative assessment and deeper appreciation is not
warranted, but equally true that bail arplications cannot be heard
and decided in a vacuum and the Courts of law should apply its
judicial mind to the collected evidence, though tentatively, to
avoid miscarriage of justice and if the doubt is apparent from
record, its concession should be extended to the accused/

petitioner even at bail stage, as is held by the apex Court in case
=

&y

-5-

titled Muhammad Faisal Vs. The State and another (2020

SCMR 971), wherein it has been held that:-

“It is established principle of law that

benefit of doubt can even be extended at

bail stage”.
8. After assessing the collected material tentatively,
this Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
petitioner has been succeeded in meking out a case for bail.
Resultantly, this petition is allowed and the petitioner is directed
to be released on bail subject to furnishing bail bond in the sum
of Rs.1,00,000/-(rupees one lac), with two sureties each in the
like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
Needless to mention that any observations made in the above

order are tentative in nature which shall not influence the trial

court.

9. Above are the reasons of my short order of the

even date. ,
