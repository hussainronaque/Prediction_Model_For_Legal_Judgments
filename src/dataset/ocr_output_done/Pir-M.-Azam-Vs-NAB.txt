JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Pir Muhammad Azam, whose earlier prayer for bail has

been turned down by this Court vide order/judgment dated

03.02.2015 in W.P. No.3500-P/2014, through this further

constitutional petition, seeks the relief of bail on fresh

ground/ medical ground.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner at the very

outset, while referring to order of this Court in Cr.Misc.BA

No.362-P/2015 decided on 24.04.2015, contended that plea

of the petitioner qua his sickness has already been admitted

by this Court, consequent whereupon, he has been granted

bail on sole medical ground in case FIR No.4 dated

18.03.2014 registered under sections 409/419/420/468/471

PPC and S.5 (2) Prevention of Corruption Act at Police

Station Anti Corruption, Peshawar, therefore, petitioner is

also entitled to concession of bail on the same ground in the

instant case.

3. The learned ADPG when confronted with the

bail granting order of the petitioner in Cr.Misc.BA

No.362-P/2015 decided on 24.04.2015, he conceded release

of the petitioner by this court on medical ground in the

above case. He, however, opposed bail to the petitioner in

the instant case and contended that best and proper

environment will be provided to the petitioner inside the jail

keeping in view the requirement of his disease while the

petitioner will not be able to get all such facilities in his

house or outside the case.

4. It appears from the record that one of us i.e.

Justice Assadullah Khan Chammakani, while dealing

with Cr.Misc.BA No.362-P/2015, of the petitioner,

enlarged him on bail on the sole medical ground by

observing as under:-

“It appears from the record that during pendency of the

instant petition, Director General Health Services,

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was directed by this Court to

constitute a Standing Medical Board for examination

of the petitioner, opinion whereof has been received,

which reads as under:-

“The Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that he has history of chronic airway
obstruction disease. He has frequent hospital
admissions and needs permanent treatment
including oxygen. He is actually ill and
presently has severe dyspnoea. He needs
urgent treatment preferably in intensive care
unit (ICU) in tertiary care hospital”.
The opinion of the Standing Medical Board is
unambiguous which clearly speaks about severity of
the disease of the petitioner, needs of urgent
treatment, that too, in intensive care unit (ICU). Now

the crucial point for determination would be as to

whether such medical facilities are available inside
the jail to meet the treatment requirements of the
petitioner. There is a detail report furnished by Senior
Medical Officer Central Prison Peshawar dated
27.02.2015, addressed to the Superintendent Central
Prison Peshawar, which speaks about serious ailment
of the petitioner, requirement of specialized treatment
to him and lack of facilities inside the jail to meet the
specialized treatment of the petitioner. For
convenience the same is reproduced below:-

“It is submitted that the above named accused
who is suffering from (COPD) was treated in
jail Hospital Peshawar for long time.
Meanwhile, he was referred so many times to
LRH to get expert opinion of the
physician/pulmonologist on dated 22.01.2015.
He was admitted by the pulmonologist in his
ward in LRH and discharged on 23.02.2015
with diagnosis of COPD (Chronic Obstructive
pulmonary Disease) on the same day due to
respiratory distress. He was admitted by Jail
medical Officer and he is still in jail hospital
admitted because he needs _ frequent
nabilization and 02 inhalation.

Now in the current scenario he was
advised ECG (which is enclosed along with for
information and ready reference which shows)

Sinus tachycardia

RT artial enlargement

RT ventricle Hypertrophy

This patient needs nabulization and 02
inhalation from time to time. The chronic chest
problem affected his heart which is evident
from the ECG.

For this purpose in my opinion as there is
no specialized treatment and_ investigation
available in Jail hospital, therefore, to avoid
inconvenience of frequent hospitalization and
discharging if the Honourable Court considers
best the accused shall be recommended for
Standing Medical Board”.

In light of the opinion of the Standing Medical Board and

report furnished by Senior Medical Officer Central Prison
Peshawar, it can be safely concluded that petitioner is suffering
from severe dyspnoea and he needs urgent treatment preferably
in intensive care unit and the facilities to meet the urgent
specialized treatment of the petitioner are lacking inside the jail
premises.

Proviso Ist to section 497 Cr.P.C. deals with bail to
any person under the age of sixteen years or any woman or any
sick or infirm person accused, which reads as under:-

“ §.497 (1).. Proviso First:- Provided that the

Court may direct that any person under the

age of sixteen years or any woman or any

sick or inform person accused of such an

offence be released on bail”

Correct criteria for grant of bail to an accused on medical , in a

non-bailable offences, has been laid down by the apex Court in

case titled, “Mian Manzoor Ahamed Watto Vs the State”
(2000 SCMR 107), in these words:-

“Correct criteria for grant of bail to an

accused in a non-bailable case on medical

ground would be that the sickness or ailment

with which the accused is suffering is such

that it cannot be properly treated within the

jail premises and that some _ specialized

treatment is need and his continued detention

in jail is likely to affect his capacity or is

hazardous to his life”.
Guidance in this regard may also be derived from case titled,
“Haji Mir Aftab Vs the State” (1979 SCMR 320). As regard
gravity of the offence, where the Court is satisfied of the
sickness of the accused and such disease cannot be properly
treated in custody, then gravity of the disease would outshine
the gravity of the offence. The apex court in case titled, “Peer
Mukaram ul Haq Vs National Accountability Bureau
(NAB) through Chairman and others (2006 SCMR 1225),
held that sick or inform person may be released on bail even if
there are reasonable grounds for believing that he has been
guilty of an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment
becasue where a statute itself lays down certain principles for
doing some acts they may be taken as a guideline for doing

something of the same nature which is in the discretion of the

Court. In case titled, “The State Vs Haji Kabeer Khan” (PLD
2005 Supreme Court 364) it has been held by the apex Court
that “Courts are not required to quality or quantify the nature of
disease and once a case is made out under the recognized
principle laid down by the Supreme Court in this behalf, bail is
to be granted on medical ground leaving prosecution at liberty to
move the Court for cancellation of bail, if health of accused has
improved during pendency of proceedings, because on the
ground of sickness or infirmity, on exceptional term, law has
offered an opportunity to an accused to enjoy the concession of
bail subject to satisfying the Court about the nature of his
ailment as well as on the ground of non-getting of proper
treatment in jail, but no sooner the accused has improved his
health, the prosecution can come forward with the request for
withdrawal of the concession of bail.”

In view of the law on the subject and deriving

wisdom from the judgment of the august apex Court, I am

inclined to exercise the discretion of bail on sole ground of

infirmity/sickness of the petitioner. Resultantly, this petition is

allowed. Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he

furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction the learned

Trial Court. The sureties must be local, reliable and men of

means”.

5. Nothing is on the record to show any new

development, such as recovery of the petitioner from his

disease or proper arrangements inside the Jail to meet the

requirements of treatment of the petitioner inside the Jail,

therefore, situation being the same, this petition is also

allowed and accused/petitioner is admitted to bail in the

instant case, provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.one Million with two sureties each in the like amount to

the satisfaction of the Judge Accountability Court-III,

Peshawar.

6. These are reasons of our short order of even

date.

Announced.
