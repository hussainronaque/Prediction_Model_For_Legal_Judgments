ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- This Jail criminal appeal,
filed by Shahid Ullah son of Rasool Khan, the appellant, is
directed against the judgment dated 24.06.2019, of learned
Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Model Criminal Trial
Court, Charsadda, whereby he has been convicted under
section 302 (b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life
as ta’azir and to pay Rs.4,00,000/-, as compensation to
legal heirs of Aman Ullah deceased in terms of section
544-A Cr.P.C. and in default thereof to undergo 06 months
simple imprisonment, in case FIR No.315_ dated
29.06.2016, under section 302 PPC, Police Station
Shabqadar, District Charsadda. Benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. The prosecution case is that on 29.06.2016 at 1815

hours, complainant Zahid Ullah (PW.6), in company of his
injured son Aman Ullah, who was semi conscious, reported
to Daud Jan HC (PW.2) in THQ hospital Shabqadar to the
effect that on the fateful day he was present on a
thoroughfare near a shop, situated in Zor Kanday. His son
Aman Ullah and Shahid (the appellant) were also present
in the aforesaid shop. At 1750 hours there was argument on
some issue between his son and the appellant which
resulted a brawl in between them. In order to separate
them, he (complainant) rushed towards them, but in the
meantime, the appellant gave knife (Chaqo) blows to
Aman Ullah on left side of his chest, as a result, he got
severely injured. After commission of the offence, the
appellant made his escape good from the spot. He
(complainant) charged the appellant for commission of the
offence. Report of complainant was recorded in the shape
of Murasila Exh.PA by Daud Jan HC (PW.2), on the basis
of which FIR mentioned above was registered against the
appellant. He (PW.2), prepared injury sheet of the injured
Aman Ullah Exh.PW.2/1 and referred him for medical
examination. Dr. Khalil Khan (PW.11) examined him on
and noticed a sharp cut wound on right shoulder and a
sharp deep wound on left side below clavicles of the
deceased then injured. After giving first aid, the injured
was referred to LRH, Peshawar, but he succumbed to
injuries, therefore, PW.11 conducted autopsy on the dead

body and opined death of the deceased due to sharp
wounds causing major blood vessels resulting into heavy
bleeding.

3. Liaqat Khan DSP (PW.5) conducted investigation
in the case, who proceeded to the spot and prepared site
plan Exh.PB on the pointation of the complainant. During
spot inspection, he secured bloodstained earth from the
place of the deceased then injured vide recovery memo
Exh.sPW.5/1 in presence of witnesses. Vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.4/1 he took into possession the last worn
bloodstained garments of the deceased then injured and
sent the same along with blood secured from the spot to the
FSL for chemical analysis report whereof is Exh.PZ. He
captured photographs of the crime spot Exh.PW.5/6 to
Exh.PW.5/10, initiated proceedings under sections 204 and
87 Cr.P.C. against the appellant and recorded statements of
the PWs. On 09.09.2016 the appellant was arrested by
Muhammad Saeed Khan SHO vide arrest card
Exh.PW.5/13 and was handed over to the I.O (PW.5), who
after obtaining his physical custody, interrogated him and
on his pointation recovered the crime knife from a
drain/water course vide pointation memo Exh.PW.5/15. As
the appellant had confessed his guilt before the media and
his confession was shown on live TV Channel by Anchor
Yousaf Jan, therefore, PW.5 obtained the said video saved

in a memory card Exh.P.4. On completion of investigation,
he handed over case file to SHO who submitted challan
against the appellant before the learned trial Court.

4. On receipt of challan by the learned trial Court, the
appellant was formally charge sheeted to which he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as eleven witnesses. After
closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein
he denied the prosecution allegations and professed his
innocence. He, however, declined to be examined on oath
under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in
defence. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court,
after hearing both the sides convicted and sentenced the
appellant as mentioned above, hence, this appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused.

6. Record depicts that occurrence has taken place on
29.06.2016 at 1750 hours which has been reported with
promptitude at 1815 hours i.e. within 25 minutes which
eliminates the possibility of consultation and deliberation
on the part of complainant in charging the appellant.
Complainant Zahidullah (PW.6) in his initial report as well
as in the statement before Court has directly and singularly
charged the appellant for murder of his son. Admittedly,
substitution of an accused charged singularly in a murder

charge is a rear phonon, particularly, when there is no
evidence about previous enmity of ill will between the
parties. Complainant while appearing as PW.6 reiterated
the same story of the offence as set forth by him in his
initial report. In his initial report he had not disclosed about
the motive rather he was so straightforward that he
disclosed that arguments between the appellant and
deceased resulted into a brawl and then the occurrence but
he did not know the motive between the deceased and
appellant. In cross-examination, it was brought from his
mouth by the defence that the issue between the deceased
and appellant was over a pigeon.
7. Umair is the shopkeeper of the shop in front of
which the occurrence has taken place. He is eyewitness of
the hot words taken place between the appellant and the
deceased over return of pigeon. Admittedly, PW Umair is
not related to the deceased rather he was the friend of
appellant. He while appearing as PW.10 has furnished the
following statement:-

“Accused Shahid Ali had friendly relations with me

and often came to my shop. I was fond of pigeons

and having so many pigeons in which one pigeon

was captured by Aman Ullah deceased and he was

not ready to return my pigeon. On the day of

occurrence I was present in my shop and accused

Shahid Ali came to my shop to whom I narrated the

whole story regarding the pigeon and _ after
sometime I found deceased Aman ullah in front of

my shop. Accused Shahid Ali also went near to him

and asked about the pigeon and also stated him to

give back the pigeon back to me and on this they

both started altercation and resulted in fight.

Accused Shahid Ali took out his knife and started

knife blows on deceased Aman Ullah, as a result of

which he received severe injuries on his body.”
The complainant and PW Umair have been subjected to
lengthy and taxing cross-examination but nothing
beneficial to defence could be extracted from their mouths.
Rather they remained stuck to their stance and corroborated
each other on all material particulars of the occurrence.
Their testimonies got support from the medical evidence
furnished by Dr. Khalil Khan (PW.11). According to his
statement the two sharp wounds, one on right upper arm
and another on left side below clavicle of the deceased
resulted into the unnatural death. The positive Serologist
report qua the blood stained earth secured from the spot
and the bloodstained last worn clothes of the deceased,
proves the place of the occurrence as alleged by the
prosecution. Similarly, recovery of the crime knife on the
pointation of the appellant strongly corroborates the ocular
account of the prosecution. Unexplained absconsion of the
appellant, soon after the occurrence, is yet another

circumstantial piece of evidence which if taken along with
direct evidence would be sufficient to prove the guilty
conscious of the appellant.

8. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant up to the
hilt through cogent and confidence inspiring direct
evidence corroborated by strong circumstantial evidence in
the shape of recoveries, referred above coupled with
medical evidence. In this view of the matter, the learned
trial Court has arrived at a right conclusion by holding the
appellant guilty of murder of Aman Ullah deceased.
However, keeping in view the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, we are not agreed with the
sentence of life imprisonment awarded to the appellant by
the learned trial Court, because it is manifest from the
record that the occurrence was the result of sudden flare
up. It has been established from the prosecution evidence
that before inflicting knife blows on the person of the
deceased, there was exchange of hot words on return of
pigeon of Umair between the appellant and the deceased,
which resulted into a sudden fight during which course the
appellant gave knife blows to the deceased. The occurrence
has taken place without premeditation and the appellant has
inflicted knife blow to the deceased in heat of passion
without taking undue advantage or acting in a cruel
manner, rather after inflicting the knife blow to the

deceased, the appellant took heels from the spot. Motive
was between shopkeeper PW Umair and the deceased over
a pigeon. Appellant was the friend of said Umair and when
Umair complained the appellant that deceased is not ready
to return his pigeon, he confronted with the deceased over
the said issue, meaning thereby that the appellant had no
personal motive with the deceased, rather what happened
between the appellant and the deceased were sudden events
without any pre-mediation and plan. Not inflicting any
knife blow by the appellant to the deceased during
exchange of hot words before the occurrence and his later
action during the brawl, are sufficient circumstances to
prove that he has acted in the course of sudden quarrel and
fight. Bare reading of the FIR would suggests that incident
has occurred by chance, because when Umair narrated the
story of missing his pigeon or stealing his pigeon by the
deceased, the unfortunate deceased emerged in front of
shop of Umair, where the appellant demanded the return of
pigeon to Umair, which resulted into a sudden fight and the
appellant in heat of passion inflicted a knife blow on the
left side below clavicle of the deceased but misfortunately ,
ruptured the main blood vessels which caused severe
bleeding and resulted into death of the deceased. In view of
the above observations, case of the appellant falls within
the ambit of section 302(c ) PPC and not 302 (b) PPC.

9. Resultantly, the impugned judgment of the learned

trial Court is modified in the manner that conviction of the
appellant under section 302 (b) PPC is converted into
section 302(c) PPC, resultantly, his sentence is reduced
from life imprisonment to 10 years R.I. and to pay
Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation to LRs of the deceased in
terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C. and in default of payment
thereof to undergo 03 months S.I. Benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. already extended to the appellant is kept intact.

10. With the above modification in the conviction and

sentence of the appellant, this appeal is disposed of

accordingly.
