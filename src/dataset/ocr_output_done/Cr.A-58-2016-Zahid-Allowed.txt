JUDGMENT

RKEKK

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant appeal,

the appellant, Zahid s/o Zahir Shah, has
impugned the judgment of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, Charsadda, dated 19.01.2016,
whereby he was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment and burdened with payment of
Rs.100,000/- as compensation to LRs of the
deceased u/s 544-A Cr.P.C or in default
whereof to suffer 06 months SI, in case FIR
No.260 dated 27.03.2013 u/s 302/34 PPC,

Police Station Charsadda.

2. Brief facts of the case as per FIR are that

on 27.03.2019, complainant/Nafees Khan
(PW11) while accompanying his brother
(Taimoos Khan) in injured and unconscious
condition to the Casualty of DHQ Hospital
Charsadda, reported the matter to local police to
the effect that he along with his brother was
present in the thoroughfare in front of their
house, when in the meanwhile, Zahid and
Dawood Jan duly armed with firearms appeared
and started firing at his brother Taimoos Khan
with the intention of killing. As a result, he got
hit and sustained injuries. Initially, FIR was
registered u/s 324/34 PPC, but on the following
day, the injured succumbed to his injuries and
section 324 PPC altered into section 302 PPC.

2. Initially, challan under section 512
Cr.P.C was submitted against the accused. On
completion of investigation, supplementary
challan was submitted in Court where the
present accused-appellant was charge-sheeted to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
The prosecution in order to prove its case,
produced and examined as many as 15
witnesses whereafter statement of the accused
was recorded, wherein, he professed his
innocence. The learned Trial Court, after

conclusion of trial, found the appellant guilty of
the charge and, while recording his conviction,
sentenced him as mentioned above. Feeling
aggrieved, the appellant has filed the instant

appeal before this Court.

3. Arguments of heard and record gone
through with the able assistance of learned
counsel for the parties.

4. There is hardly any occasion to believe
that prosecution has established its case against
the present appellant. Perusal of the FIR
reveals that the occurrence took place in the
thoroughfare, however, as per site plan
(Ex.PB) presence of the deceased (then
injured) has been shown at point-1, but
recovery of blood has been effected from
point-1A which is, indeed, the room of the
house of one Sher Nawaz. This initial loophole
in the prosecution case ultimately disputed the
place of occurrence.

5. The site plan further reveals that from
point A, two (02) empties of 30 bore and from
point ‘B’, six (06) freshly discharged empties
of 30 bore have been recovered. Conversely,
the recovery memo (Ex.PW2/3) shows
recovery of 02 empties of 30 bore from

‘dag/maidan’ while 04 empties of 30 bore,
freshly discharged, from inside the room.
Moreover, the FSL report also shows that all
the six empties were fired from different
weapons. Thus, the site plan and recovery
memo do not support the prosecution version
rather these are in direct conflict on the
material point of recovery of crime empties,
whether these were 8 or 6 in total which
definitely created serious doubt in the
prosecution case. However, the FSL report
(Ex.PZ) suggests that the recovered empties
sent thereto were six and were fired from two
different 30 bore pistols used in the
commission of offence.

6. The site plan further reveals that there
were 4 bulbs/energy savers installed on points
C, D, E & F, but the recovery memo shows
that the IO took into possession only two bulbs
and sealed into parcels.

7. Perusal of the post-mortem report shows
three entry and three exit wounds of the same
dimension, the injuries sustained were shown
to be on head, shoulder and buttock, whereas
the inquest report of deceased shows that there

were three wounds ie. at the head, right
shoulder and on right hand, so these documents
also speak different volume of the episode.

8. As per site plan one Shakir was shown
to be an eyewitness, but he was abandoned by
the prosecution, for unknown reasons. So, in
the situation, adverse inference under Article
129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 can
be safely drawn. In this regard reliance could
be safely placed on case law reported in NLR
2015 SCJ 121. Even otherwise, in the situation
legal inference could also be drawn that if the
said witness had entered into the witness box
then he would not have supported the
prosecution case. Case law refers: PLD 2016
SC 17.

9. Perusal of record shows that one of the
prosecution witness namely, Mazullah No.137
has been examined twice during trial. First as
PW-2 on 27.10.2014 and second as PW-5 on
30.01.2015. This witness escorted the dead
body of the deceased Taimoos Khan from the
casualty to mortuary. Both his statements
recorded before the trail Court are reproduced
below:

PW-2 Mazullah No.137 (27.10.2014)

“The injury sheet and inquest along

with dead body was handed over to me
and I escorted the dead body from DHQ
Hospital to the Mortuary for PM
examination. I handed over the dead
body to the doctor for PM examination
and no one interfered the dead body
during my escort. After the PM
examination the doctor handed over to
me the last worn garments of the
deceased to me, which I handed over to
the investigating officer.

XX...The relevant documents and the
dead body of the deceased were handed
over to me on 28.03.2013 and it was

after noon time....... ”,

PW-5 Mazullah No.137 (27.10.2014)

“I have escorted the dead body from
casualty to Mortuary for PM
examination. During my escort no one
interfered with the dead body. After the
PM examination I was handed over the
PM report and garments of the
deceased. The dead body was handed
over to his legal heirs, whereas, the PM
report and garments of deceased were
handed over to the investigating officer
in the police station. My statement was
recorded by the investigating officer u/s
161 Cr.P.C.

XX...Nil. Opportunity given...”

However, this witness has never mentioned in
his above statements that at what time he
escorted the dead body for post-mortem.

10. PW-4 is the doctor who conducted the
autopsy on the dead body of deceased, who
deposed as under:-

PW-4
“On 28.03.2013 at 00:45 hours, I had
conducted autopsy on the dead body of
deceased Taimoos Khan son of Akbar
Khan r/o Quaid Abad _ Colony,
Charsadda brought by the police and
identified by Waheed Ullah and
Shakir.......

Probable time b/w injury and
death....one and half an hour.....B/w
death and P.M.....one hour and fifteen

minutes”.

From perusal of the above statement of PW-4,
it reveals that post-mortem of the deceased was
conducted on 28.03.2013 at 12:45 pm (read
with statement of PW-3 Nadeem Jan No.1433).
The total time consumed between injury and
death and between death and post-mortem has
been shown to be 2 hrs and 45 minutes.
Conversely, the time of occurrence has been
shown in the FIR as 10:35 pm. So in the given
scenario, time of occurrence would be the time
when the deceased sustained injuries i.e. 10:00
am and not 10:35 pm as alleged by the
complainant. It seems that the occurrence has
not taken place in the mood and manner as
alleged by the prosecution.

11. PW-9, who is the marginal witness to
the recovery memos deposed during trail in the

following manner (relevant portion):-
“IT am marginal witness to the recovery
memo Ex.PW9/1_ vide which the
investigating Officer took into
possession blood through cotton from
the place of deceased and sealed the
same in parcel in my
PFESCNCE.......0ceeeeeee the investigating
officer took into possession three energy
savers from the main gate of the houses
of Shakir, Shah Nawaz and Nafees

which were lit at the time of occurrence

and sealed the same in parcel....... ”,

Astonishingly, this witness has not disclosed
about the exact place from where the blood
was recovered. Moreover, as is evident from
the above statement, there were four bulbs
shown in the site plan, then why only three
bulbs/energy savers were taken into possession
and why the bulb/energy saver installed inside
the room shown at point ‘F’ (from where the
alleged recovery of blood has been effected)
was not taken into possession. In view of the
fact, that it was a night occurrence, and the
energy saver installed inside the room was of
utmost importance with regard to identification
of the accused-appellant, would required to
have been taken into possession and produced
before the Court so as to prove its capability of

light, but intentionally was not done so. To our
utter surprise, the recovered energy savers
taken into possession from outside the hujra
(mentioned in site plan) were not produced
before the Court during the Trial. Leaving
something, necessary for bringing home the
guilt of accused, and not producing something
taken into possession in connection with
substantiating the crime, often results into
disarray to prosecution case, as was done in the
instant case. This conduct of the IO also
indicates that there was something wrong at the
bottom. Even otherwise, the evidence in
support of a night occurrence could seldom
believe rather placed in the valley of doubts
unless proved unimpeachably and
charismatically. Wisdom is derived from case
law reported in 2016 SCMR_ 1515, 2017
SCMR_ 135, 2017 SCMR 1189 & 2017
SCMR 960.

12. Moreover, the most important witness
i.e. complainant while appearing before the
learned Trial Court as PW-11, deposed as
under:-

PW-11

“On the night of occurrence I along with
my brother deceased Taimoos Khan were

present on the spot. In the meanwhile
10

accused Zahid, Dawood Jan sons of
Zahir Shah came duly armed with and
started firing at us with intention to kill
us, with their fire shots my deceased
brother Taimoos Khan hit. After being hit
the deceased entered the Hujra of one
Sher Nawaz. I went towards another side
to take shelter. When I came back my
brother was seriously injured and we took
him to DHQ Hospital, Charsadda, where,
my report was recorded, which was read
over and explained to me and after
admitting it correct, I thumb impressed
the same. One Shakirullah also verified
my report. Haji Zareef has also witnessed
the occurrence beside me. The accused
suspected us to have informed the police
who raided their house. The site plan was
prepared.

XX. .eeees I and my deceased brother
Taimoos Khan, were standing closed side
by side. No sooner did the accused appear
they started firing at us. The distance of
the place, where I took shelter from the
spot might be 70/80 yards and when I was
decamping for taking shelter my back was
towards the accused. I went to the house
of Shakirullah for shelter. The site plan
was prepared at my instance and
pointation which is correctly prepared at
my iNSTANCE........0066 The investigating
Officer had recovered blood, empties
from the spot but not in my presence,
however, in the presence of witnesses. I
did show the bullet marks to the
investigating officer at the surrounding
walls....... I have no relation whatsoever
with PW Zareef Khan. Zareef Khan
belongs to village Prang Khaista
Khel......... I shifted Taimoos Khan

deceased then injured to the hospital in a
11

motorcar. The car was already parked
there. I have not shown the place of the
car where it was parked to the
investigating officer. The car was brought
to the spot from the place where it was
parked, the time might be consumed 4/5

minutes. The car was driven by my

nephew Usman........”

The above deposition of PW-11/complainant
clearly suggests that he is improving in his
stances beyond the insertions made in the initial
report. It has not been mentioned in the FIR that
how the deceased (then injured) was shifted to
hospital and by what means. However, in his
statement made before the Court the that the
deceased (then injured) was shifted to hospital
in a motorcar, but, the complainant could not
disclose the registration number of the
motorcar.

13. Prosecution witnesses while appearing
before the Court made improvements in their
statements to strengthen the prosecution case,
such improvements had caused serious doubts
on veracity of such witnesses, therefore, this
court come to the conclusion that such
statements are not worthy of reliance.
Improvement once found to be deliberate and
dishonest would cause serious doubts on

veracity of witnesses. Both the eye witnesses
12

are closely related to the deceased. One
showing extraordinary strange conduct as close
relative after having seen brother of one of the
eyewitness murdered and other tried his best to
suppress certain facts proving that it was an
unwitnessed occurrence and the witnesses had
seen just the deceased (then injured) and not
the occurrence in action. Exclusion of said two
witnesses from consideration would result that
no evidence was left on record to connect the
accused with the crime because the rest of the
evidence is corroborative piece of evidence.
Reference can be made to case law reported in
1984 SCMR 42, PLD 1981 SC 472, 1972
SCMR 578, 2007 SCMR 1825, 1990 SCMR
158 & 2011 SCMR 474.

14. Be that as it may, suffice it to say that
driver of the car, namely, Usman (nephew of
complainant) has not been examined during
trial. Had it been, he would have been helpful
and support the version of complainant
Guidance could be safely sought from case law
laid down in 2018 SCMR_ 153, NLR 2015
SCJ 121 & PLD 2016 SC 17.

15. As is apparent from the statement of

PW-11, two accused duly armed stated firing at
13

the complainant party. Question arises here
that why the complainant remained unhurt in
the volley of firing or why the accused
tendered such an unnatural courtesy by
spearing the complainant knowing well that he
would depose against them. Such behavior on
the part of the accused persons ran counter to
natural human conduct and this behavior is
well explained in the provisions of Article 129
of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984.
Moreover, the phenomena suggest that neither
the complainant nor the other eye witness was
present at the spot of occurrence. In this regard
we are forfeited to seek guidance from case
law reported in 2017 SCMR 596.

16. It is in the © statement of
complainant/PW-11 that one Zareef Khan
(PW-12) was also shown present at the place of
occurrence, as is evident from the site plan, but
astonishingly, he was not shown in the initial
report (FIR).

17. Last but not the least, PW-12, when
produced before the Court, has not only
negated the stance of complainant taken in his
cross examination that “the deceased then

injured was shifted to hospital in a motorcar’
14

by deposing that the deceased then injured was
shifted to hospital by the complainant/PW-11
on a “cot” but has also proved himself to be a
chance witness in the instant case as he has not
justified his presence at the spot at such at late
night coupled with the fact that he was the
resident of Prang Khashta Khel situated at
about 2/3 kilometers away from the spot of
occurrence. Wisdom cane be derived from the
dictum reported in 2016 P.Cr.L.J_30. For
ready reference, the statement of PW-12 is
reproduced below:-

“I am government contractor by
profession. On 27.03.2013, I was
present along with Inayatullah and
Shakir Ullah in the Hujra of Sher
Nawaz, as we _ were partners.
Inayatullah went to his house for
bringing writing pads, in the
meanwhile one Taimoos Khan
entered into the Hujra who had put
his hand on his shoulder, felled
down, followed by accused Zahid and
Dawood and chased him both of
them, fired at Taimoos Khan and
decamped from the Hujra. Then
Nafees Khan brother of Taimoos
Khan and Inayatullah came there,
put him in a cot and took to the

hospital”
15

2. Medical evidence is in conflict with
ocular evidence, hence reliance on such ocular
testimony is also unsafe.

3. In view of the law laid down in NLR
2015 Cr.C 186, the evidence of PW-11 & 12,
in the stated circumstances of the instant case,
could not be _ believed and_ discarded
accordingly.

4. From perusal of the case evidence, we
conclude that the prosecution witnesses were
not telling the actual truth rather posing
themselves to the principle of ‘falsus in uno,
falsus in omnibus’ meaning thereby “false in
one thing, false in everything. Believing such
assailable evidence by the Court of law would
be definitely against the administration of
criminal justice resulting into judicial death of
an innocent accused.

5. The crux of afore-mentioned discussion
is that either the prosecution witnesses were not
present on the spot or they are not telling the
truth. Prosecution has miserably failed to build
any nexus of the accused-appellant with the
commission of the offence. We are forfeited by

the case law reported in PLJ 2019 SC

(Criminal Cases) 265.
16

18. The above discussion has led this Court
to believe that the learned trial court has erred
in appreciating the case evidence in its true
perspective. It has been held, time and again by
the superior courts, that a slightest doubt
occurs in the prosecution case is sufficient to
grant acquittal to an accused. For giving the
benefit of doubt, it is not necessary that there
should be many circumstances creating doubts.
Single circumstance creating reasonable doubt
in the prudent mind about the guilt of accused
makes him entitled to its benefit, not a matter
of grace in concession, but as a matter of right.

Reliance could be placed _on 2009 SCMR

230, 2011 SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR 646, 1984

PLD SC 433, 2012 MLD 1358, 2007 SCMR

1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J 376, 1994 PLD
Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD Peshawar 01, 1999
P.Cr.L.J_ 1087, 1997 SCMR_ 449, 2011
SCMR 820 & 2006 P.Cr.L.J SC 1002. The
conclusions drawn by the learned trial Court
are not borne out of the case evidence,
therefore, the impugned judgment is not

sustainable.
17

7. For what has been discussed above and
while extending the benefit of doubt to the
appellant, the instant appeal is allowed, the
impugned judgment is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charge levelled
against him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not

required to be detained in any other case.

8. Above are the reasons of short order of
even date.
