Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
4. During the course of trial, the
prosecution has examined as many as 11
witnesses whose statements were recorded and
placed on file. On closure of the prosecution
evidence, accused were examined under
section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they denied the
charges, claimed innocence and stated to have
falsely been implicated in the case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/ Izafi Zilla
Qazi Matta, Swat convicted and sentenced the
accused/appellants Tajay alias Tajbar and Taj
Muhammad Khan vide the judgment
impugned herein, whereas the co-accused
Aqal Zada was acquitted of the charges by
extending him the benefit of doubt, hence
these connected matters.

6. The learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellants has argued that all the
prosecution witnesses were _ interested,
therefore, their testimony was wrongly
believed by the trial Court in respect of guilt

of the accused/appellants. He has further

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
argued that the complainant while appearing
in the Court had made dishonest
improvements in her statement, therefore, she
was an untruthful witness, hence, reliance on
her statement was illegal for awarding life
imprisonment to both the accused/appellants.
He has also referred to the contradictions in
the ocular testimony and the medical evidence
because all the witnesses had stated that
accused Taj Muhammad had put the pistol on
the head of the deceased and then fired at her,
whereas the medical evidence does not show
that there were any charring marks on the head
of the deceased. He went on arguing that
although the complainant had stated that they
were bringing household articles but no such
household articles were recovered from the
spot and lastly he referred to the main
contradiction in the statement of the
complainant by stating that in her FIR she had
stated that the accused were accompanying
them in the vehicle/ Suzuki carrying them to

the place of occurrence, whereas in her Court

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
statement she did not say about company of
the accused and the deceased in the vehicle.
He has placed reliance on ‘’2017 MLD 883,
2017 P Cr. LJ 235, 2017 P Cr. LJ 779, 2017

SCMR__ 344 and 2017 SCMR__160”’.

Conversely, the learned counsel for the
complainant and learned A.A.G appearing on
behalf of State while rebutting the arguments
of learned counsel for the appellants have
stated that in presence of the motive it is not
expected from the complainant to substitute
the accused-appellants who are her cousins for
actual culprits. They have further stated that it
was a daylight occurrence, duly witnessed by
an independent eyewitness Maiz Rahman.
Lastly, they have argued that the prosecution
version is supported by medical evidence,
recovery of empties from the spot and a pistol
on the pointation of the appellant, therefore,
the accused/appellants were rightly convicted
by the trial Court. They have placed reliance

on the case law cited as “Mir Muhammad
and 3 others vs the State (1972 P Cr. LJ

NAWAB/PS* DB; Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
1108), Saeedullah Khan vs The State (1986

another _vs_ The State (2010 P Cr. LJ II

The State (2011 SCMR 460).

7. Arguments of the learned
counsels were heard at length and record of
the case was perused with their valuable
assistance.

8. The close perusal of record
would unfold that the complainant Mst.

Husina, PW-6 alongwith other witness while

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-12-

accompanying the dead body of her mother in
a vehicle met Said Ahmad Khan, ASHO, PW-
5 at 13:00 hours on 31.07.2014 wherein she
reported that she alongwith her mother Mst.
Sakina had gone to Rodingar. On return when
reached at kacha road Asharay, accused
Tajbar Khan, Taj Muhammad Khan (present
appellants), Aqalmand (acquitted accused) and
Sher Baz (absconding accused) who were also
in the vehicle and when they alighted from the
vehicle the accused Taj Muhammad Khan,
made firing on her mother, due to which her
mother was hit at the head and died. Similarly,
Tajbar Khan also made firing at her mother
from which she received firearm injury and
died, however, the accused Agalmand and
absconding accused Sher Baz caught-hold of
her mother. The occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by Maiz Rahman, PW-8, Mst.
Shafiga and Mst. Sahira, PW-7.Motive behind
the occurrence was stated to be a dispute over

property.

The record further discloses that

edifice of the entire prosecution case is based

on the ocular evidence of Husina Bibi, the

NAWAB/PS*

DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
= tah

complainant, PW-6, Sahira her sister, PW-7
and Maiz Rahman, PW-8. Regarding the
mode and manner of occurrence, that at the
place of occurrence the accused Aqalzada and
Sher Baz had caught-hold of the deceased and
both the appellants had fired at her and as
result of their fire shots the deceased sustained
injuries, who died on the spot, all the three (3)
witnesses are consistent and unanimous,
however, the complainant Husina Bibi in her
First Information Report had stated that all the
accused were travelling with them in the same
vehicle and when they alighted from the
vehicle the incident took place. Whereas in
the Court statement she did not say about the
company of the accused in the vehicle.
Furthermore, during cross-examinations all
the witnesses have stated that the
accused/appellant No. 2 Taj Muhammad put
the pistol on the head of the deceased and
fired at her, however, this statement was not
given in the examination-in-chiefs. The

question arises as to whether this variation

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Alli
would

witnesses. In order to appreciate the aforesaid
variation, we can draw wisdom from the law
laid down by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in “Roshan vs The State PLD 1977
Supreme Court 557’’ wherein the following
principles have been laid for appreciating the

testimony of witnesses where there are certain

-15-

discard testimony of all three (3)

variations in their statements:-

NAWAB/PS*

“

To my mind the primary
consideration in appraising the
evidence given by witness is to
determine firstly why has he
offered to testify? Has he seen the
occurrence? If so has the witness a
motive to implicate a person who
was not among the culprits or to
exaggerate the part played by any
of them? If a witness satisfies these
two tests then the Court should
watch the general demeanor of the
witness in order to fudge the
quality of his perception and his
faculty to recall the past incidents.
A witness may make contradictory
statements on some of the details of
the incident in respect of which he
is deposing in Court. The variation
may be due to mere lapse of
memory or the confusion caused in
his mind by a relentless cross-
examination. Very often a witness
gives an incorrect statement
because he must answer every
question regardless of the fact
whether he answer to it or not. It is
not uncommon that the cross-exam
words in the mouth of witnesses
and the presiding officer is not
vigilant enough to check it. It is
also. common experience that,

DB: Mr, Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-16-

without any particular intent, even
educated people exaggerate when
describing an event. Some
witnesses may be prone to it more
than others. Mere contradictions
therefore do not lead to the result
that whatever the witness has said
on the salient features of the case
and which conforms to the other
evidence on the record is to be
thrown overboard”’. (Emphasis
supplied).

The aforesaid law laid down by

the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was

re-affirmed in “Mushtag alias Shaman vs
The State (PLD 1995 Supreme Court 46) and
Farmanullah vs Qadeem Khan (2001 SCMR

1474). Therefore, the evidence of a witness
more particularly a related witness has to be
seen with care and caution. If it gives
impression that the witness has made
dishonest improvement in his/her statement
only in order to implicate the accused then
his/her evidence is to be discarded. However,
if the witness has omitted some part of her/his
earlier testimony, which were recorded in the
FIR or in the Court statement then the same
may not fatal to the prosecution case,
however, there can be no uniform standard of

evaluation of the evidence of every witness. It

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
= {Fe

depends on the ability, age and demeanor of a
witness to reach at a conclusion that the said
omissions were deliberate else it cast doubt on
his/her presence on the spot.

11. The complainant Husina Bibi as
evident from the record her age in the
Court statement is given as 25 years, however,
it also discerns from record and the statement
of Said Ahmad Khan, ASHO, PW-S5 that at the
time of registration of FIR her age was 16/17
years. Similarly her sister Sahira who is
another eyewitness to the occurrence is
admittedly at the time of recording of her
statement was 17/18 years of age. It is also
evident from record that the father
of complainant had earlier died and they had
a property dispute with their cousins, the
present appellants. Keeping in view her age
and illiteracy non-mentioning of the fact that
the accused were also travelling with them in
the vehicle carrying them would not render

her untruthful witness as there is a probability

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-18-

that she could not explain the minute details in
her Court statement.

12. Even otherwise, conviction of the
appellants was not solely based on the
statement of complainant, she is supported by
her sister Sahira (PW-7) and there is yet
another independent witness to the occurrence
i.e. Maiz Rahman, PW-8. Since the occurrence
has taken place in a public place/passage and
the said Maiz Rahman has given justification
for his presence at the spot, therefore, he
cannot be termed as chance witness in strict
sense. Regarding the presence of a witness at
public passage the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in case of “Muhammad Ahmad and

another vs the State & another reported as

1997 SCMR 89” formed the following view:-

“Passerby not always a chance
witness. Presence of a passerby
at the place of occurrence taking
place at a public thoroughfare or
at a place frequented by the
public generally cannot be
rejected by describing him as a
mere chance witness unless he
fails to satisfactory explain his
presence at or near the spot at
the relevant time or his testimony
suffers from any inherent
weakness or contradiction.

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
~19

The aforesaid law laid down by

the august Supreme Court of Pakistan was

also follow in case of “Iftikhar_Ali vs the

State_reported_as_ 1998 P Cr. LJ 2022”,

wherein it was held by the Hon’ble High
Court:-

“Passerby is not a chance witness
if the crime is committed on a
public thoroughfare or at a place
frequented by the public
generally.”

Although, in his  cross-
examination he has admitted that he had a
property dispute with acquitted accused
Aqalzada and absconding accused Sher Baz
but that dispute relates to a period 8 years
before the occurrence which was settled,
therefore, this witness has no interest to
falsely implicate the present appellants, thus,
his testimony is confidence inspiring and
support the statement of complainant and her
sister.

13. The FIR has been promptly
lodged and the time of occurrence is also
corroborated by the medical evidence. In the

FIR the time of occurrence was given as 12

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
=90's

o clock and the FIR was registered at 13:00
hours, whereas according to the medical report
the deceased was examined at 04:00 P.M and
the time between death and examination was
given as less than 6 hours. Therefore, there is
no doubt in the time of occurrence, hence
medical report support the prosecution case.

14. As far as the objection of the
learned counsel for the appellants that it is in
the evidence of all the three (3) eyewitnesses
that appellant Taj Muhammad put pistol on
the head of the deceased and fired at her,
however, the lady doctor in her report could
not refer to any blackening or charring marks
on the body of the deceased. This objection is
not worth consideration because it is quite
possible that in cases where the pistol is
stressed tightly against the skin of the body,
then the gases of the explosion and the flame,
smoke and particles of gunpowder will
all follow the track of the bullet in the body
and will not necessarily cause charring marks

or blackening on the body of victim.

NAWAB/PS* DB: ‘Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
BAUS

In Mir Muhammad’s case 1972 P Cr. LJ

1108, the Hon’ble High Court while relying
on the accepted treaties, ‘’the Identification of
Firearms and Forensic Ballistics’? by Major
Sir Gerald Burrard (in 1956 Edition) has
elaborately discussed this aspect of the case as
follow:-

However, Mr. Abdul Hafiz Memon, the
learned Assistant Advocate-General,
contended that no blackening or
burning was discovered on the wound
of the deceased Noor Ahmad. We
would not go as far as that, but would
say that the medical evidence is silent
on this point. But this omission does
not prove that the fatal gunshot was
not fired at contact or close range to
the body. According to Modi’s Medical
Jurisprudence and Toxicology (13"
Edn, page 224), the blackening and
burning may be absent if the weapon is
pressed tightly against the skin of the
body, as the gases of the explosion and
the flame, smoke and particles of
gunpowder will all follow the track of
the bullet in the body. In the present
case, it would appear that the shot-gun,
when fired, was pressed tightly against
the body of Noor Ahmad.”’

Therefore, the said objection of
the learned counsel for the appellants is
misconceived.

15. The prosecution case also lends
support from recovery of 4 firearm empties of
30 bore which were recovered from the spot

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
Ws

vide recovery memo Ex. PW-2/2 and on
pointation of the accused/appellant Taj
Muhammad from his Baitak a 30 bore pistol
alongwith 2 cartridges Ex. P-1 was recovered
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-4/2 on
09.8.2014. Both of the recovered items were
sent to the Forensic Expert, which he received
on 07.08.2014 and according to his report Ex.
PW-9/15 only one crime empty marked as Cl
was fired from 30 pistol which was recovered
from appellant Taj Muhammad whereas 3
empties did not match with the said pistol,
which gives inference to the fact that both the
accused fired at the deceased.

16. Moving further to the objection
of the learned counsel for the appellants
regarding the non-recovery of household
articles from the spot, suffice it mention that
such discrepancy reflects on the working and
lethargy of the Investigation Officer which
would obviously not cause any harm to the
prosecution case when it is otherwise

established through ocular evidence. Reliance

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ee

is placed on the case of august Supreme Court

of Pakistan cited as Abdul Majeed vs the

State (2008 SCMR 1228).

17. Regarding the acquittal of
accused Aqalzada on the same set of evidence,

the learned trial Court in its judgment has

distinguished his role and has held that it was

improbable that at the time of actual

commission of offence he was holding the

deceased and thus he was acquitted of the

charges by extending him the benefit of doubt.

Even otherwise, the role of Aqalzada is

distinguishable from the present appellants,

therefore, from his acquittal the appellants

cannot be extended any benefit.

18. In view of the above discussion,
we do not find any merits in the appeal on the
question of guilt both the accused/appellants,
therefore, the judgment of conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned trial Court is
maintained and this appeal is dismissed
accordingly.

19, Likewise, the connected criminal

revision bearing No. 56-M of 2015 preferred

NAWAB/PS* DB: Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
= 94s

by the complainant/petitioner, we have noted
that in view of the present facts and
circumstances of the case the conviction of
life imprisonment awarded to the
accused/respondents is justified and does not
warrant further enhancement. Therefore, the
criminal revision in hand for enhancement

also stands dismissed.
