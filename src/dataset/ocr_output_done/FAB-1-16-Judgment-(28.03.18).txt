JUDGMENT
Date of hearing ....28.03.2018

National Bank of Pakistan
Vs
Haroon Qayum
Appellant by: Mr. Nazir Ullah Qazi, advocate.
Respondent by: Mr. Aimal Khan Barkandi, advocate.

JOS IIE
QAISER RASHID KHAN, J-. Through the appeal
in hand, the appellant-bank has expressed its
grievance against the judgment and decree dated
01.12.2015, passed by the learned Banking Court-I,
Peshawar whereby the application of the respondent-
defendant for correction of the decretal amount was
allowed.

2. All that the learned counsel for the
appellant-bank vehemently urges is that in view of
Section 27 of the Financial Institution (Recovery of
Finance) Ordinance, 2001, the learned Banking
Court had no jurisdiction to correct or review the

judgment and decree as it was passed ex parte on
01.08.2015 on account of the non-appearance of the
learned counsel for the respondent-defendant as well
as non-filing of leave to defend application in time
but then on the application moved by the respondent-
defendant the decretal amount was reduced from Rs.
673,246/- to Rs. 6,03,135/-. He further contends that
the decree earlier passed in favour of the appellant-
bank was strictly in accordance with law and
keeping in view the duly certified statement of the
account. He relied on the unreported judgment of
this court dated 01.06.2016 in FAB No. 20-P of
2015.
3. The learned counsel for the respondent-
borrower on his turn supported the impugned
judgment and decree on almost the same grounds as
detailed therein.

Arguments heard and the available record
perused.
4. As the record unfolds, it was the
respondent-borrower who had applied to the
appellant-bank for the grant of Gold Finance facility
of Rs. 508,000/- which was accordingly sanctioned

in his favour vide Demand Finance Gold Proposal

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
dated 16.04.2013 with its date of expiry as
30.06.2014. In this respect he executed the
necessary documents including the Finance
Agreement, Letter of Pledge and Demand
Promissory Note. A cursory glance at the Finance
Agreement would show that an amount of Rs.
508000/- has been mentioned therein as the sale
price rather so to say the amount availed of by the
respondent-borrower from the appellant-bank, but
strangely enough, the very figure of Rs. 508000/- has
also been mentioned to be the purchase price or for
that matter the buy-back price or mark up amount
payable by the respondent-borrower to the appellant-
bank by the date of expiry of the finance limit. Even
the date of expiry has not been mentioned in the
Finance Agreement. The said agreement is not only
incomplete and deficient according to Banking
Practice and Procedure but has also limited the
liability of the respondent-borrower to the appellant-
bank to the extent of Rs. 508000/- i.e. the finance
amount availed of by him. The appellant-bank has
not been able to present any account or explanation

for such gross irregularity committed by it.

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
{

However, in the undated Demand Promissory Note,
Rs. 603351/- has been mentioned to be the amount
payable by the respondent to the appellant-bank by
the date of expiry i.e. 30.06.2014.

It was on account of the default committed
by the respondent-borrower in liquidating his
outstanding liability when the appellant-bank was
constrained to file a recovery suit as on 04.06.2015
against him before the learned Banking Court which
was decreed ex parte on 01.08.2015 to the extent of
Rs. 673246/- with costs of suit and costs of fund as
notified by the State Bank of Pakistan from time to
time from the date of default till the final realization
and accordingly, execution proceedings were
simultaneously set in motion.

5. It was thereafter when the
respondent/judgement debtor submitted an
application for the correction of the decretal amount
and after the reply was sought from the appellant-
bank, the request of the respondent/judgment debtor
was acceded to and the decretal amount was

corrected as Rs. 603135/-instead of Rs. 673246/-, in turn

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
prompting the appellant-bank to file the present
appeal.

6. During the course of brief submissions, our
attention was drawn to the very statement of account
as annexed with the suit which is otherwise certified
under section 4 of the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act,
1891. It shows an amount of Gold Finance of Rs.
508000/- availed of by the respondents as on
16.04.2013 and also the buy-back price of Rs.
603135/- as on 30.06.2014 1.e. the date of the expiry
of finance limit. Said amount of Rs. 603135/- also
corresponds with the figure reflected in the Demand
Promissory Note which is in fact the final amount
payable by the respondent-borrower to the appellant-
bank. However, after the date of expiry and in view
of the default committed by the respondent-borrower
in paying off his liabilities, the appellant-bank could
have approached the learned Banking Court through
a recovery suit but it opted not to go for such
exercise till it filed the recovery suit after about one
year of the expiry of the finance limit as on
4.06.2015 but in the meanwhile, still, debited an

amount of Rs. 70111/- to the account of the

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
respondent-borrower on 20.05.2015 whereby the
outstanding amount soared to a_ figure of Rs.
673246/- and that was the figure claimed by the
appellant-bank from the respondent-borrower
through its recovery suit.

When the learned counsel for the appellant-
bank was specifically questioned as to how could the
appellant-bank debit such an exorbitant amount of
Rs. 70111/- to the account of the respondent-
borrower after the date of expiry of the financial
limit, he stated that the same was by way of costs of
fund. However, the statement of account does not
mention the said phrase ‘Costs of Fund’ but only the
word ‘Transfer’ in respect of the amount of Rs.
70111.00. When still questioned, as to under what
provision of law or even under State Bank
Regulation, the appellant-bank could justify the
debiting of the costs of funds to the account of the
respondents, the learned counsel could not furnish
any plausible reply.

7. Initially an amount of Rs. 673246/- (which
also included the amount of Rs. 70111/- alleged by

the appellant-bank to be the ‘Costs of Fund’) was

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
decreed ex parte against the respondent-borrower
together with further ‘costs of fund’. It appears that
the appellant-bank in utter disregard to the standard
Banking Law and Practice debited such big amount
of Rs. 70111/- to the account of the respondent-
borrower under the subterfuge ‘Costs of Funds’
albeit through a Transfer’ entry and also got a decree
in its favour for further costs of fund from the
learned court. It goes without saying that such
exercise was undertaken by the appellant-bank in a
surreptitious manner as neither in its plaint nor in the
statement of account, it has said a word about such
entry to be the ‘ Costs of Fund’. By allowing the
application of the respondent-borrower for the
correction of the decretal amount, the learned
Banking Court indeed rectified its own error and the
same was not only in the fitness of circumstances but
in accordance with law as well.

8. Since the learned counsel for the appellant
has relied on section 27 of the Financial Institutions
(Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, therefore,
it would be more apt to reproduce the same as

below;

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
“Finality of order:- Subject to the
provisions of Section 22, no Court or
other authority shall revise or review or
call, or permit to be called, into question
any proceeding, judgment, decree,
sentence or order of a Banking Court or
the legality or propriety of anything done
or intended to be done by the Banking
Court in exercise of jurisdiction under
this Ordinance.

Provided that the Banking Court may, on
its own accord or on application of any
party, and with notice to the other party
or, as the case may be, to both the parties,
correct any clerical or typographical
mistake in any judgment, decree, sentence

r order passed by it.”

The proviso to section 27 furnishes
sufficient reply to the objection of the learned
counsel for the appellant-bank viz the impugned
judgment and decree of the learned Banking Court
which stipulates in clear terms that the Banking
Court may either of its own accord or on application

of any party and after notice to the opposite side may

Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Muhammad Ayub Khan (DB)
~~

correct any clerical or typographical mistake in its
judgment.

9. The learned Banking Court-I, Peshawar
through its impugned findings only rectified its own
mistake through the correction of the decretal
amount and the same cannot be termed to be the
review of the ex parte judgment passed earlier.

10. In view of the forgoing discussion, we do
not find any illegality in the impugned findings of
the learned Banking Court-I, Peshawar and
accordingly, this appeal stands dismissed with no

order as to costs.

Announced,
28.03.2018.
