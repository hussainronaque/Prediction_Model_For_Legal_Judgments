IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J:- By the impugned

judgment, learned Court below, has dismissed the
complaint filed Under Section 3 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, by the appellant on the ground
that appellant had not proved his dispossession
from the suit property.

2. Brief facts of the case are that appellant
filed a complaint under section 3 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005 against the respondents
No. 1 to 7 to the effect that on 30.09.2012 at 12:00
noon respondents duly armed alongwith a Tractor

*Ijaz*

the complaint was sent to the local police for
investigation/inquiry. After | completion of
investigation, the local police submitted report
before the learned trial Court and after framing of
charge against the respondents the learned trial
Court examined 05 witnesses. After close of
prosecution evidence, statement of respondents
were recorded u/s 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they opted
not to be examined on oath or to produce defence
evidence. After hearing learned counsel for the
parties, the learned trial Court acquitted the
respondents from the charges levelled against them
by dismissing the complaint of the appellant vide
impugned judgment dated 28.02.2015, hence the
instant criminal appeal.

3. Learned counsel for appellant contended
that learned Court below has not properly
appreciated the evidence on record as_ the
respondents had legally ejected from the suit
property through process of competent Court and
they had challenged their dispossession/ejectment
before the Revenue Official, but their petition had

also dismissed but this aspect of the case had not
*Ijaz*

brought under consideration by the learned trial
Court below which has caused miscarriage of
justice.

4. On the other hand learned counsel for the
respondents argued that the impugned judgment
has been rendered by a competent Court of law,
thereafter proper appreciation of law and evidence
on record; that the appellant had miserably failed to
substantiate the allegations levelled against the
respondents and failed to prove its case against the
respondents.

5. | have heard learned counsel for the
parties and gone through the record with their
valuable assistance.

6. The record reveals that the suit property
and other non-disputed property had remained
bone of contention because one Abdul Wahab and
respondent namely Zigrawar which culminated in
favour of Abdul Wahab.

7. It would be pertinent at this stage, to give
reference to one out of several cases in which
during course of execution the respondent namely

Zigrawar was Officially dispossessed from the suit
*Ijaz*

property as well as other undisputed property. It
was the case of appellant bearing No.669/9 dated
06.06.2002, wherein after partition of joint property
owned by Abdul Wahab and others, the suit
property was entered in the name of Abdul Wahab
as exclusive owner and thereafter the possession
was also delivered to Abdul Wahab on 01.07.2009.
8. Respondents being aggrieved by the
execution of order of Revenue Officials dated
01.07.2009, preferred an application for restoration
of the suit property on the ground that they were
tenant at will, over the suit property, could not be
ejected without due process of law. The same
application was finally dismissed by Senior Member
Board on 02.01.2010. Respondents, thereafter
knocked the door of learned Sessions Judge,
Mardan for redressal of his grievance under Section
3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, against legal heirs
of Abdul Wahab namely Fazal Wahab etc, which was
dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-ll,
Mardan vide its judgment dated 10.09.2009.

9. The application for restoration § of

possession moved before the Revenue Authorities
*Ijaz*

and the complaint u/s 3 of the Illegal Dispossession
Act, preferred by respondent namely Zigrawar, in
very clear terms, reveals that although he was
tenant at will over the suit property, but during
course of execution proceeding, initiated by legal
heirs of Abdul Wahab, respondent namely Zigrawar
was ejected and the possession of the suit land was
delivered to legal heirs of Abdul Wahab.

10. The legal heirs of Abdul Wahab
namely Fazal Wahab etc sold out their whole
property except a few kanal to various persons and
the suit property was sold to the appellant namely
Roidad Khan, pursuance to compromise effected
between the appellant and vendors of the suit
property dated 13.12.2013 duly placed on record of
Civil Revision No.491/2013 subjudice before this
Court.

11. All the above mentioned cases
and others record, the attested copies were
duly placed on record of the present case,
which had also been discussed by the learned
trial Court below, but at the end, it was held

that appellant was not illegally dispossessed
*Ijaz*

from the suit land. Respondents were under
their legal obligation to prove their legal
possession over the suit land, where, they were
already ejected from the suit land, in pursuance
of execution of order of Revenue Official,
through assistance of local police and
respondents have also challenged their
ejectment through competent Court of law, but
in vain. However, respondents have not claimed
to be in or over the possession of the suit land.
12. In such state of affairs, where appellant
claimed to be illegally dispossessed and the
same allegation is supported by the statement
of Inquiry Officer, while on other hand,
respondents had not come with any legal plea
to protect the possession of the suit land, then
the learned trial Court was under its legal
obligation that at least made direction under
Section 8 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, to
deliver back the possession of the suit land to

appellant which reads as:-

8. Delivery of possession of property
to owner, etc-----(1) On conclusion of
trial, it the Court finds that an owner
or occupier of the property was
*Ijaz*

illegally dispossessed or property
was grabbed in contravention of
section 3, the Court may, at any time
of passing order under sub-section
(2) of that section direct the accused
or any person claiming through him
for restoration of the possession of
the property to the owner or, as the
case maybe, the occupier, if not
already restored to him under
section 7.

(2) | For the purpose of sub-section
(1), the Court may, where it is
required, direct the officer-in-charge
of the police station for such
assistance as may be required for
restoration of the possession of the
property to the owner or as the case
may be, the occupier.

13. The above mentioned provision of
law, in unequivocal terms, describe that if the
Court finds that an owner or occupier of the
property was illegally dispossessed or property
was grabbed in contravention of section 3 of
the Act, the Court may pass direction for
restoration of the property.

14. It is proved by the
complainant/appellant that he had been
illegally dispossessed by the respondents, as
the property under consideration, had not
reportedly, in possession of the appellant, while
during course of inquiry, no any other person

except the respondents were found in
*Ijaz*

possession of the property, however, during
course of trial of the case, respondents had
denied therefrom the commission of the
offence under section 3, but never in explicit
terms had disclosed that the property was not
under their possession. In case, respondents
had not illegally dispossessed the appellant,
then by passing any direction in regard to
restoration of possession of the property to
appellant, they shall not raise any objection on
restoration of the possession of the property,
under consideration in instant appeal.

15. Therefore, for the aforestated reasons,
this appeal is disposed of in terms that property
under consideration, shall be restored to the
appellant in term of section 8 of the Illegal
Dispossession Act. The impugned judgment is
modified to such extent and the case is
remanded to learned trial Court to proceed in
term of section 8 of the Illegal Dispossession
Act, in order to deliver the property to
appellant. In case of any hurdle, resistance

either by respondents or any other person on
*Ijaz*

their behalf, the learned trial Court shall
exercise its jurisdiction under sub-section (2) of
section 8 of the Act, in order to direct the
officer-in-charge of the concerned police
station for such assistance necessary for
restoration of the possession of the property to

the appellant.
