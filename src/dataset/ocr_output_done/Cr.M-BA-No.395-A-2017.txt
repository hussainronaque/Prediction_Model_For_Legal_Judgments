SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.-
Accused-petitioner, Abdul Khanan, seeks his post
arrest bail in case FIR No.364 dated 17.04.2017
under sections 419/420 of Pakistan Penal Code,
1860 registered at Police Station City, Mansehra.

2. The case of the prosecution against the
petitioner, registered on the report of complainant
Aamir Iqbal, is that on 13.12.2016, accused/petitioner
has sold motorcar No.ATM-411 Toyota XLI model
2010 for a sum of Rs.1,200,000 and complainant paid
him cash amount of Rs.750,000/- and also handed
over documents of the vehicle but he took away the
vehicle fraudulently. Later on, the complainant got

checked the documents of the vehicle and came to
know that the vehicle was registered in the name of
Bank Alfalah. Thereafter, on 21.03.2017 a jirga was
convened between the parties, wherein, it was decided
that the accused/petitioner would return the amount of
Rs.200,000/- till 01.04.2017 to the complainant,
otherwise, the vehicle will be handed over to him for
Rs.1,000,000/- and accused/petitioner would also
liable to pay Rs.200,000/-, which he had received
from the complainant.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and learned State counsel heard
and record perused with their able assistance. In this
case, respondent No.2 appeared before the A.R,
however, when the case was fixed before the Court,
he failed to appear on 11.07.2017. Thereafter, this
Court has given another opportunity for his service
and he was properly served on 15.07.2015 for today’s
hearing, however, despite service he is not in
attendance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the
complainant has entered into a bargain of motorcar
with the accused/petitioner and paid him Rs.750,000/-
in cash, who handed over documents to the
complainant. However, later on the complainant

compromised the matter with the accused/petitioner.
Admittedly, the motorcar is registered in the name of
Bank Alfalah, meaning thereby that the vehicle and
documents are genuine. It was alleged by the
complainant in his report that after receipt of
Rs.750,000/- from him, the accused/petitioner
fraudulently took away motorcar with him. The nature
of alleged fraud committed by the accused/petitioner
is such that it cannot be determined without recording
of evidence by the trial Court. Moreover, the bargain
took place between the parties on 13.12.2016,
whereas the present F.I.R has been lodged against the
accused/petitioner on 17.04.2017 after delay of about
four months. Additionally, applicability of the section
419 PPC to the facts of the case would also be
determined by the learned trial Court, even otherwise,
the offences under section 419 cheating by
personation and section 420 Cheating and dishonestly
inducing delivery of property provide seven years
punishment, which do not fall within the prohibitory
clause. In view of the peculiar facts and
circumstances, the case against the petitioner is prima
facie that of further inquiry into his guilt.

5. In Zafar _Iqbal’s_ case (2009 SCMR
1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex Court has

explicitly expressed the principles for considering the
grant of bail, where offences do not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. The said
principles have consistently been followed by the
Honourable Supreme Court, as it has been held in
Riaz Jafar Natiq’s case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid
down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v.
Muhammad Anwar and others (2009
SCMR 1488) ordaining that where a
case falls within non-prohibitory
clause the concession of granting bail
must be favourably considered and
should only be declined in exceptional
cases. We do not find this to be a case
where it should be refused as an
exception. Thus, this petition is
converted into an appeal and the
same is allowed and, resultantly, the
petitioner is admitted to bail subject to
Surnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.
1,00,000 (Rupees one hundred
thousand only) with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction
of the learned trial Court.”

6. In any case, investigation in the
present case is complete and the accused/petitioner
is not required to the police for the purpose of
further investigation. In peculiar facts and
circumstances of the present case, no useful
purpose is going to be served by keeping him
behind the bars.

7. Consequently, this bail application is

accepted and accused-petitioner, Abdul Khanan, is

admitted to bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in
the sum of Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred
Thousands) with two sureties, each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of the I//laga/Duty Magistrate,
Mansehra.

8. The observations rendered hereinabove,
would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any

manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.
