AK

MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, J.- By filing of this writ
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, the petitioner has
assailed the judgment and order of learned Additional
District Judge XII, Peshawar , dated 30-01-2020, whereby
his revision petition was dismissed and, consequently, the
judgment and order of Learned Civil Judge-I, Peshawar,
dated 07-03-2019 was upheld.

2. Facts of the aforementioned petition are that the
Respondent No. 1 has filed civil suit No. 124/1 against
respondents No. 2 to 10, for declaration to the effect that
he is owner to the extent of 7-3/4 Marla of property
bearing Khasra No. 1309/5, 1310/5, 1311/5, 1308/5,
situated in Peshawar City, in the shape of plot boundaries
whereof were given in head note “A” of the plaint, to

which respondents No. 1 & 2 have got no concern,

2

therefore, their claim pertaining to the said property is
in-effective upon his rights. Along with declaration, a
decree for perpetual injunction and in alternate decree for
possession was also prayed for. The said suit was decreed
on 15-12-2010 and decree holder (respondent No.1) has
filed an application for execution in which the Executing
Court has issued warrant of possession. The contention of
petitioner was that on the strength of decree in Suit No.
124/1, the decree holder wants to take physical possession
of petitioner’s property. The petitioner came to know
about the decree when allegedly Bailiff of the Court
proceeded to the spot, hence, he filed an application under
section 12 (2) C.P. C on the ground that decree was the
result of fraud and misrepresentation of the facts. Learned
trial court has dismissed the application against which the
petitioner filed revision, but the same too met the same
fate.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner contended that the
petitioner is owner in possession of the property bearing
khasra No. 1322/30 to the extent of one marla on the
strength of registered deed No. 1819 dated 18-09-2013,
which was not the subject matter of suit No. 124/2, thus,
the petitioner’s owned and possessed property could not
be handed over to the decree holder. Next, he contended
that the decree in suit No. 124/1 was the result of fraud

and misrepresentation, and both these facts were requiring

3

framing of issues and recording of evidence, but the
courts below have misread the record which resulted into
miscarriage of justice, therefore, the judgments and orders
being perverse, wrong, illegal and against the facts are
liable to be set aside and the petitioner being necessary
party in suit No. 124/1 may be impleaded and be given an
opportunity to protect her rights. In support of his
arguments, he relied on 2019 CLC 2016, 2019 CLC 847,
2015 CLC 931, 2019 CLC 1841, 2010 SCMR 500.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Admittedly, the property owned by the petitioner
was not the subject matter of suit No. 124/1, thus, there
was no decree against the petitioner’s property. Record
reveals that in suit No.124/1, no decree for partition was
passed on the basis of which the specific portion of the
property was to be handed over to the decree holder.
Record also transpires that the decree for declaration was
to the extent of shares in the joint property and as per the
provision of Order XI Rule 35 (2) of CPC, only symbolic
possession would be handed over to the decree holder.
The main thrust of arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner was that under the garb of decree in suit
No.124/1, the petitioner’s owned and possessed property
is intended to be taken from him. In such a situation, the
remedy has already been provided by the legislature in

the code of Civil Procedure 1908, under the provision of

4

Order XXI Rule 99, 100 and 10lof C.P.C, whereunder
the petitioner could approach to the Executing Court by
contending that no decree has been passed regarding her
property but in no case the contention of the petitioner
could be treated under section 12 (2) of CPC. The
provisions of Order XXI Rule 99, 100 & 101 are
reproduced as under: -

“99. Resistance or obstruction by bona fide
claimant. Where the Court is satisfied that the
resistance or obstruction was occasioned by any
person (other than the judgment debtor) claiming in
good faith to be in possession of the property on his
own account or on account of some person other than
the judgment debtor, the Court shall make an order
dismissing the application.

100. Dispossession by decree holder or purchaser.
(1) Where any person other than the judgment debtor
is dispossessed of immovable property by the holder
of a decree for the possession of such property or,
where such property has been sold in execution of a
decree, by the purchaser thereof, he may make an
application to the Court complaining of such
dispossession. (2) The Court shall fix a day for
investigating the matter and shall summon the party
against whom the application is made to appear and
answer the same.

101. Bona fide claimant to be restored to
possession. Where the Court is satisfied that the
applicant was in possession of the property on his
own account or on account of some person other than
the judgment debtor, it shall direct that the applicant
be put into possession of the property.”

6. Likewise, in case of possession from joint property

the mode of possession would be under Order XI Rule

5

35(2), which is reproduced as under: -

Rule 35(2) Where a decree is for the joint
possession of immoveable property, such
possession shall be delivered by affixing a copy of
the warrant in some conspicuous place on the
property and proclaiming by beat of drum, or other
customary mode, at some convenient place, the
substance of the decree.

7. Turning to the contention of learned counsel for
petitioner that before passing the impugned order, neither
issues were framed nor pro and contra evidence was
recorded. There is no cavil with the proposition that an
application under section 12 (2) of CPC should be treated
as a suit but it equally settled principle of law that in
every application under section 12(2) there is no need to
frame issues and record evidence, rather it depends upon
the facts of case to case. In the case of Mst. Shabana
Irfan versus Muhammad Sham Khan and other 2009
SCMR 40, it was held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
that: -

“ Needless to add that petition under section 12(2)
of the C.P.C. can be decided summarily by the
learned Court, which has passed the final judgment,
decree or order in dispute, when there are admitted
facts, documents between the parties. There is no
need to prolong the litigation, when the case ex
facie appears to have not been filed in a wrong
jurisdiction, and when fraud or misrepresentation
was not involved therein the case or in the
transaction.”

In case of Mrs. Amina Bibi through General

6

Attorney versus Nasrullah and others 2000 SCMR 296, it

was held by Supreme Court that: -
“while dealing with the allegations under section 12(2),
C.P.C., it is not incumbent upon the Court that it must,
in all circumstances, frame issues, record evidence and
follow the procedure prescribed for decision of the suit
as held if Amiran Bibi v. Muhammad Ramzan (1999
SCMR 1334). In the instant case, we have gone through
the application under section 12(2), C.P.C., moved by
the petitioner and the material available on record. In
view of the facts and circumstances of the case and the
judicial orders passed up to this Court during the
protracted litigation, the application filed by the
petitioner under section 12(2), C.P.C., was liable to be
dismissed without formulating issues and recording
evidence of the parties.”
8. When in suit No. 124/1, the petitioner’s property
was not the subject matter then there was no case of either
fraud or misrepresentation of fact.
9. For the reasons discussed above, this petition being
bereft of merit is hereby dismissed in /imine.
Announced.
