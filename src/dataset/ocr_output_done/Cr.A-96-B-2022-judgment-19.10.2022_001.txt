[Judicial Department].
Cr.A No.96-B of 2022
Imtiaz Ali Khan
Vs.

The State

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 19.10.2022

Appellant-Petitioner M/s. Imran Ali Shah Mandan & Abid
Anwar Khattak, Advocates.

Respondent /State by: Mr. Qudrat Ullah Khan Gandapur,
Asstt: AG.

SHAHID KHAN, J.- Imtiaz Ali Khan, the convict/appellant has

called in question his conviction & sentence recorded by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court, Takht-
e-Nasrati, Karak in case F.I.R No.559, dated 24.8.2020 under
section 9-D Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CNSA 2019 of police station

Y.K.S Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak.

2. It so happened, Bego Khan SI on_ public
complaints against convict/appellant regarding his involvement
in the business of narcotics & smuggling, on the fateful day,
time & place he received information about presence of the
accused in his baitak and that he had made plan to smuggle
huge quantity of narcotics/chars to the Province of Punjab. The
complainant along with his team rushed to the spot under the
supervision of DSP Takht-e-Nasrati. On sight of the police

party, the accused lifted a sack and tried to flee away from the
2

scene of occurrence, however, he was apprehended and his
body search led to the recovery of one .30 bore pistol without
number along with fixed charger containing 4 live rounds of
the same bore from the folder of his Shalwar. On checking the
sack, 08 packets of chars wrapped with yellow scotch-tap were
recovered. On weighment, each packet came out to be 1000
grams, total 8000 grams chars. Samples were drawn from each
packet for its analysis, sealed in parcels and the remaining stuff

was sealed in separate parcels accordingly.

3. On completion of the investigation the matter was
sent up for trial and the learned trial Court after recording the
evidence of the prosecution followed statements of accused,
heard the learned prosecutor and learned defence counsel,
whereof, arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution has
brought home charge against the accused, as such, convicted &
sentenced accused Imtiaz Ali Khan under section 9-d KP
CNSA for life imprisonment with fine in the sum of

Rs.5,00,000/- or six month S.I in default.

4. It obliged the convict/ accused Imtiaz Ali Khan to

approach this Court through subject appeal.

5. Learned counsel for the appellant is focal and
consistent on the proposition that evidence on record has not
been properly appreciated by the learned trial Court. Added,

the PWs have made dishonest improvements in their Court's
statements and also materially contradict each other but the
learned trial Court ignored the contradictions and fall into an
error by not extending the benefit of doubt to the appellant.
Further added, the prosecution witnesses are divergent in their
respective accounts regarding the mode & manner of the
recovery in question. Also added, being abadi deh, availability
of the independent persons on the scene of occurrence could no
way be ruled out but none from the general public has been
cited as witness to the recovery proceedings. Further added, the
exercise of drawl of samples followed by the sealing process is
not in accordance with the law on subject. Also added, the
prosecution has failed to prove safe transmission of the
samples to the F.S.L. Concluded, the learned trial Court has
fallen in error as not to highlight the material contradictions
coupled with the infirmities in the prosecution’s evidence
which creates a reasonable doubt in a prudent mind and the
accused as a matter of right deserve his acquittal by extending

the benefit of doubt to him.

6. Conversely, learned A.A.G_ rebutted the
contentions & stance of the learned counsel for the appellant
and highlighted loud & clear that the occurrence is the outcome
of prior information to the seizer officer and the recovery has
been affected from baithak of the convict/appellant in the
presence of marginal witnesses. Added the account of the

seizer officer and marginal witnesses to the recovery
proceedings is direct and consistent on the material points as
drawl of samples from each & every packet followed by
sealing the samples and the remaining stuff accordingly. Also
added that the seizer officer and the marginal witnesses to the
recovery proceedings have faced the searching examination-in-
cross of the learned defence counsel but nothing as such could
be extracted from their mouths which could be made as base
even for the slight doubt in respect of the bid to be foiled. Went
on to argue the samples so transmitted for its analysis to the
F.S.L were being under the escort of a police official in sealed
condition followed by its safe transmission to the F.S.L,
whereof, found to be in sealed condition, as such, a remote
chance of replacement or otherwise can be excluded. The
evidence so furnished is direct & consistent on the material
points and the learned trial Court has appraised the same in a
logical & legal manner. The learned trial Court has explained
each & every act right from the raid followed by the
interception of the accused and recovery of the stuff as well as
the recovery proceedings, drawl of samples, its positive F.S.L
report and ended in the conviction of the accused through a
comprehensive judgment, therefore, the same does not need

any interference at all and the subject appeal is worth dismissal.

7. Close perusal of the impugned judgment of the
learned trial Court coupled with the analysis of the evidence so

recorded would transpire that after the exercise of the seizure
av)

and arrest of the convict/appellant, exercise of required
documentation was carried on the spot and the murasila was
transmitted to the police station for the registration of the event.
The alleged narcotics as charas was recovered from the
convict/appellant on 24.8.2020 while the samples so drawn
were received to the F.S.L through FC No.258 on 26.8.2020.
The complainant during statement as PW-2 stated that he
drafted application to F.S.L Ex.PW2/3. The statement of the
complainant is silent as to whether he had handed over the case
property to the investigation officer or Muharrir of the police
station. Maqsood Khan, retired SI (PW-6) during cross-
examination admitted that the case property and accused were
not handed over to him by the seizing officer on the spot. He
further admitted that accused and seizing officer were present
in the police station on his return. The F.S.L report available on
file reveals that the samples were taken to the F.S.L by FC
No.258, however, neither the said official, nor Muharrir of the
concemed police station were examined by the prosecution
during trial. By now it is settled that the prosecution is duty
bound to prove the recovery of narcotics, then the separation of
samples and sending of the samples through safe hands and
any violation on the part of the prosecution would go to the
roots of the case of the prosecution. More so, register No.19
has not been produced during trial. Irrespective of the fact that

the samples and the stuff might be in the safe hands and
6

question of replacement or otherwise may not strike the
prudent mind but it shall not skip the attention of the Court that
the subject irregularity and illegality is not curable at all and it
touches roots of the prosecution’s case for the simple reason
that replacement or otherwise could no way be ruled out. In
this regard reliance is placed on the case titled “The State
through Regional Director ANF Vs. Imam Bakhsh and

others” (2018 SCMR 2039) wherein it has been held that:-

“We have heard the learned counsel for the
parties and have gone through the record
with their assistance. At the very outset, it
is observed, that the controversy in these
cases revolves around the consequence of
non-compliance of Rules 5 and 6 of the
Rules. In other words, whether the said
Rules are mandatory or directory and
whether non-compliance of these Rules
invalidates the Report of the Government
Analyst. Another overlapping ground in
some cases has been the lack of safe
custody and safe transmission of the
recovered substance from recovery till its
receipt by the Narcotics Testing
Laboratory.

Chain of Custody - Safe custody and safe

transmission

9. We have noted above that in
Criminal Appeals Nos. 523 to 525/2017
and No. 22/2018, safe custody and safe
transmission of the alleged drug from the
spot of recovery till its receipt by the
Narcotics Testing Laboratory are not
satisfactorily established. The chain of
custody begins with the recovery of the
seized drug by the Police and includes the
separation of the representative sample(s)
of the seized drug and their dispatch to the
Narcotics Testing Laboratory. This chain
of custody, is pivotal, as the entire
construct of the Act and the Rules rests on
the Report of the Government Analyst,
which in turn rests on the process of
sampling and its safe and secure custody
and transmission to the laboratory. The
prosecution must establish that the chain of
custody was unbroken, unsuspicious,
indubitable, safe and secure. Any break in
the chain of custody or lapse in the control
of possession of the sample, will cast
doubts on the safe custody and safe
transmission of the sample(s) and will
impair and vitiate the conclusiveness and
reliability of the Report of the Government
Analyst, thus, rendering it incapable of
sustaining conviction. This Court has
already held in Amjad Ali v. State (2012
SCMR 577) and Ikramullah v. State (2015
SCMR 1002) that where safe custody or
safe transmission of the alleged drug is not
established, the Report of the Government
Analyst becomes doubtful and unreliable.

8. The record is silent regarding the protocols of
drawl of samples followed by its safe custody and_ its
transmission to the FSL for analysis, the very inception of the
case of the prosecution is tainted with doubts. It is indeed
settled that the prosecution is under obligation to establish the
safe custody of the samples strictly in accordance with law.
The august Apex Court in case titled, “Mst. Sakina Ramzan

Vs. The State” reported in (2021 SCMR 451), held that:-

“The chain of custody or safe custody
and safe transmission of narcotic drug
begins with seizure of the narcotic drug
by the law enforcement officer, followed
by separation of the representative
samples of the seized narcotic drug,
storage of the representative samples
and the narcotic drug with the law
enforcement agency and then dispatch of
the representative samples of the
narcotic drugs to the office of the
chemical examiner for examination and
testing. This chain of custody must be
safe and secure. This is because, the
Report of the Chemical Examiner enjoys
critical importance under CNSA and the
chain of custody ensures that correct
representative samples reach the office
of the Chemical Examiner. Any break or
gap in the chain of custody i.e., in the
safe custody or safe transmission of the
narcotic drug or its representative
samples makes the Report of the
Chemical Examiner unsafe and
. unreliable for justifying conviction of

the accused. The prosecution, therefore,
has to establish that the chain of custody
has been unbroken and is safe, secure
and indisputable in order to be able to
place reliance on the Report of the
Chemical Examiner.”

9. Reliance is also placed on the judgment of august
Apex Court titled “Ishaq Vs. The State” (2022 SCMR 1422),

wherein it is held that:-

(b) Control of Narcotic Substances Act
(XXV of 1997)---

---S.9--- Possession of narcotics---
Prosecution failing to establish safe
custody and safe transmission of samples
from the police to the Forensic Science
Laboratory---In a case containing the
said defect on the part of the prosecution
it cannot be held with any degree of
certainty the prosecution had succeeded
in establishing its case against an
accused person beyond any reasonable
doubt.”

10. Beside above, there are material contradictions in

the evidence so furnished which damage. the case of
2

prosecution case. Complainant (PW-2) stated in his
examination-in-chief that he arrested the accused vide card of
arrest Ex.PW2/2 and drafted murasila Ex.PA/1 on the spot and
sent the same through constable Asif No.682 for registration of
F.LR but contrary to the above, PW-7 namely Asif Rehman
No.682 during examination-in-cross admitted that the S.H.O
had also handed over to him case property along with murasila
report which he delivered at police station. Similarly, Fakhar
Zaman No.656 (PW-3) during examination-in-cross stated that
his statement under section 161 Cr.P.C was recorded by the I.O
on the spot, however, this portion of his statement was
contradicted by the ILO (PW-6) who during examination-in-
cross admitted that he prepared site plan Ex.PB at the instance
& pointation of complainant and thereafter he returned to
police station where he recorded the statement of complainant

and other witnesses under section 161 Cr.P.C.

11. It is cardinal principle of Criminal! Justice that
every individual is presumed to be innocent, unless proved
guilty. It is the bounden duty of the prosecution to prove its
case beyond any shadow of doubt and if any reasonable dent or
doubt is found in prosecution case, the benefit of the same is to
be extended to the accused, not as a matter of grace or
concession but as a matter of right. The cardinal principle of
criminal administration of justice is based on the concept of

justice in Islam which is to be observed more consciously and
Pas

10

carefully. Benefit of doubt of features appearing in the case
invariably, are required to be given full effect while deciding
the ancillary matters in a criminal case. Benefit of doubt, if any,
favourable to the accused cannot be withheld in the exercise of

discretion of the Court.

12. The prosecution is not only duty bound but under
obligation to substantiate its case beyond any reasonable doubt
and even a single or slightest doubt is floating on surface of the
record, its benefit has to be extended to the accused not a
matter of grace but as a matter of right and it would be
sufficient enough to discredit the prosecution’s story. It is well
embedded principle of criminal justice that there is no need of
so many doubts in the prosecution’s case rather a single
reasonable doubt arising out of the prosecution evidence,
pricking the judicial mind is sufficient for acquittal of the
accused. Reliance is placed on a case law “Tariq Parvez Vs.
The State” (1995 S C M_R_1345). The same principle has
been reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of

“Muhammad Akram Vs. The State” (2009 S C M R 230).

13. There is no second opinion about the fact that the
cardinal principle of justice always laid emphasis on the
quality of evidence which must be of first degree and sufficient
enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court with regard to

the implication of innocent persons alongwith guilty one by the
G

\ 7

11

prosecution, otherwise, the golden principle of justice would
come into play that even a single doubt if found reasonable
would be sufficient to acquit the accused, giving him/them
benefit of doubt because bundle of doubts are not required to
extend the legal benefit to the accused. In this regard, reliance
is placed on a view held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of "Riaz Masih alias Mithoo Vs. State (NLR_ 1995
Cr.SC 694).

14. The accumulative effect of the above discussion is
that the prosecution has miserably been failed to prove the case
against the accused beyond shadow of doubt, therefore, the
instant appeal is allowed and accused/appellant is acquitted of
the charges levelled against him. He be set free forthwith, if

not required in any other criminal case.

These are the detailed reasons of our short order of
even date.
