MOHAMMAD _IBRAHIM_KHAN, _¥J.- This
petition has been moved by petitioner (Niaz
son of Muhammad Nawaz alias Tamas) for
his release on bail in case FIR No. 159 dated
26.08.2021 registered against him under
Sections 324 / 337-F(iii) / 34 PPC read with
Section 15 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms
Act, 2013 at Police Station Kaghan Camp
Mahandri District Mansehra.

2. Allegation against the petitioner, as
per first information report, is that he had
attempted at the life of the complainant and
his brother Abdul Qadeer, however, luckily
they escaped unhurt while minor son of the
complainant namely, Mehraban, received

firearm injury on his abdomen.
3. Having heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties as well as the
learned State counsel, the record was gone
through with their valuable assistance.

4. Learned counsel for the petitioner
while placing reliance on the judgment
reported in 1998 P.Cr.L.J 728 [Peshawar]
titled “Bahadur Khan Vs. Ajmal Khan &
another” vehemently argued that in the instant
case as per site plan position firing was
allegedly made on the victim from eight (08)
to twenty (20) paces while the doctor found
charring marks not only on the entry wound
but also on the exit wound whereas in the
referred judgment firing was made from six
(06) paces and charring marks were found on
the body of the deceased as per medico-legal
report, therefore, bail cancellation petition of
the accused therein was declined on this
score alone.

5. The learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the complainant strongly rebutted
the ibid stance of the petitioner and placed

reliance on the judgments reported in 2020
SCMR 1486 titled “Sheqab Muhammad Vs.
The State & others”, 2021 SCMR 1157 titled
“Ghazan Khan Vs. Mst. Ameer Shuma &
another’, 2021 SCMR 1225 titled “Noor
Aslam Vs. The State through PG and
another’, 2011 P.Cr.L.J 1308 [Peshawar]
titled “Khial Muhammad Vs. The State
through Shaheed Ullah” and 2019 P.Cr.L.J
Note 24 [Sindh (Larkana Bench)] titled
‘Wazeer Ali Vs. The State”, however, on
perusal not even a single judgment was found
on the subject wherein besides charring
marks from a distance of eight (08) paces on
the body of a victim / deceased bail could
have been declined to an accused.

6. No doubt the petitioner has directly
been charged by the complainant in a
promptly lodged FIR and allegedly the
weapon of offence has also been recovered
from him on his pointation rather report of the
FSL regarding crime empties and weapon of
offence has been received in affirmative but
intriguing aspect of the case is that as per

injury sheet, prepared by the police, a single
firearm injury has been found below the
umbilicus with bleeding whereas as_ per
medico-legal report two injuries have been
found. Besides, the doctor opined that both
the injuries i.e. entry and exit wounds have
charring marks with no active bleedings, thus,
the version of the complainant is not in line
with the medical report. Furthermore, as per
site plan position, the victim has been shown
present at point No.3 while the petitioner has
been shown firing from point No.7, 8 & 9. The
distance between point No.3 and points No.7,
8 & 9 are eight (08), nine (09) and twenty (20)
feet respectively. In the ibid scenario, a
question would arise that whether the alleged
firing at the most from eight (08) feet can
cause charring marks and that too on the
entry wound what of talk of its exit wound,
which question can only be resolved by the
learned trial court after recording evidence,
thus, at the moment, the petitioner has
succeeded in making a case arguable for the

purpose of bail.
7. For what has been discussed above,
this petition is allowed and the petitioner is
directed to be released on bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds in the sum of rupees one
lac (Rs.1,00,000/-) with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaga /
Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
8. Needless to mention that the
petitioner has also filed an application bearing
No. 1159-A/2021 whereby addition of Section
337-F(iii) PPC has been sought. As the
referred section of law has been inserted later
on during investigation, therefore, this
application is allowed and the ibid section of
law shall be deemed to have been included in
the main bail petition.
