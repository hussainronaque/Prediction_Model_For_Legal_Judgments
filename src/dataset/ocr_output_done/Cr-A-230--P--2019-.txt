2. Brief and essential facts of the case are that upon an
allegation of short supply of various life saving drugs in
the Market i.e Salazopyrin and Solucortef; the Provincial
Drug Inspector, District Bannu, issued show cause notice
to accused Afsar Mal Khan, Branch Manager of M/s
Madina Enterprises Bannu; being authorized distributor of
the Company with direction to explain their position, in
response, they submitted their reply; whereafter,
complainant issued show cause notice to M/s Pfizer
Pakistan Ltd; Dr. Sadia Moazam, Head Regulatory Affairs
of Pfizer Pak Ltd submitted reply to the show cause notice;
thereafter, case was sent to the Provincial Quality Control
Board Peshawar for necessary guidance; that the Board
accorded sanction for prosecution of accused in Court
under the relevant provisions of Drugs Act, 1976; followed
by complaint against the accused.

3. On receipt of complaint, the learned trial Court
summoned the accused, formal charge against them was
framed, which they denied.

4. In order to bring home charge against the accused;

prosecution examined complainant Aurangzeb Khan, Drug
asa

Inspector District Bannu, as (PW-1) and closed its
evidence. Statements of the accused under section-342
Cr.PC were recorded, wherein they denied the allegations
leveled against them; neither, they wished to record their
statements on Oath within the meaning of Section-340 (2)
Cr.PC; nor, opted to produce evidence in defence.

5. | Upon conclusion of trial, learned Chairman Drug
Court, KPK, Peshawar, through the impugned judgment
dated 12.02.2019, acquitted accused Afsar Mal Khan and
Mrs. Sadia Moazam of the charges leveled against them;
however, convicted the appellant Wajihuddin for violation
of Rule-30 (4) (5) of Drugs Registration, Licensing and
Advertising Rules, 1976, and sentenced him under section-
27 (4) of the Drugs Act, 1976, to imprisonment till rising
of the Court with a fine of Rs.50,000/- with publication fee
of Rs.1000/-, the appellant deposited the amount of fine
with publication fee before the trial Court. Feeling
aggrieved from his conviction and sentence, the appellant

filed the present appeal before this Court.
6. We have heard arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record with their able
assistance.

7. Prosecution in support of its case relied upon the
solitary statement of PW-1 Aurangzeb Khan, Senior Drug
Inspector (complainant), who reiterated, the story reflected
in the show cause notice (EX PW 1/2) and (EX PW 1/4).
This PW in his cross examination stated that; “Self stated
that I had received verbal complaints from the patients as
well as in markets and I, upon my own source, in the
public interest, started the case. It is correct that none of
these persons statement was recorded by me nor they have
been arrayed as witnesses. I did not myself check the
availability of drugs in question in general medicines
market. .......It is correct that drugs having the same
formula, manufactured by other companies are available
in the market. The generic name of Solucortef is
hydrocortisone while I do not know the generic name of
salazopyrine.” The ibid statement clearly reflects that
alternative drugs were available in the market. Therefore, it

could not be said in the given circumstances that due to
non-supply of the ibid drugs, there was shortage in the
market.

8. Besides, record further depicts that complainant vide
letter No.156/District Bannu dated 22.F/2016 called
explanation from Managing Director/Chief Executive M/s.
Pfizer Pak Ltd, Karachi, for shortage of Salazopyrin and
Solucortef 100,250 & 500mg in the market; in response,
Dr. Sadia Moazam, Head Regulatory Affairs of M/s Pfizer
Pakistan Limited, through letter No.PS/PDI/01/2016 dated
April 05, 2016 responded that vide letter
No. WD/REG/02/2015 dated May 19,2015 and
WD/REG/03/2015 dated May, 19, 2015, they had
requested for withdrawal of registration of Salazopyrin
(Sulfasalazine) 500mg Tablets, Solu-Cortef
(Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate) 100mg, 250mg &
500mg injection. For ready reference her reply is
reproduced as under;

“SALAZOPYRIN.

We have already communicated to the
registration board on May 19, 2015 and requested for
withdrawal of license. Due to introduction of new
therapies, the product is less preferred by doctors and
low in demand. Further as per our application it has

been mentioned that product has been not into
production since May 2013.
yest

SOLU-CORTEF:
Request has been submitted for withdrawal of

license. Response is still awaited and we are following
the matter with concerned authorities.”

Which fact has also been admitted by PW-1 in his cross
examination that alternative drugs having the same
formula, manufactured by other companies are available in
the market. He also admitted that in response to his show
cause notice, M/s Pfizer Pakistan Ltd, informed him qua
withdrawal of registration of the product in question.
9. Production of drugs and its regular and adequate
supply in the market is governed by Rule-30 (4) & (5) of
the Drugs Licensing Registration and Advertising Rules,
1976, which are reproduced below for ready reference;
“(4) Every drug shall be produced in sufficient
quantity so as to ensure its regular and adequate
supply in the market.
(5) The manufacturer of any drug shall not, without
the prior approval of the Registration Board, be
discontinued for a period which may result in its
shortage.
Provided that in the circumstances beyond the
control of manufacturer of a drug which may lead to
reduction in the production of that drug, the

circumstances may be intimated to the Registration

Board.”

10. Indeed, under the ibid rules, it is the

responsibility of the manufacturer to produce and ensure
7

supply of drugs in the market in sufficient quantity; albeit,
in the circumstances beyond his control, causing reduction
in production of a particular drug, then, the same may be
intimated to the Registration Board.

11. It further depicts from record that Dr. Sadia
Moazam, Head of Regulatory Affairs, of Pfizer Pakistan
Limited, vide letter WD/REG/02/2015 and;
WD/REG/03/2015 dated May 19, 2015 addressed to
Chairman & Director Registration Pharmaceutical
Evaluations and Registration Division Drug Regulatory
Authority of Pakistan Ministry of National Health
Services, Regulations and Coordination, Islamabad, made
request for withdrawal of registration qua Solu-Cortef
(Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate) 100mg, 250mg &
500mg Injection with information that Pfizer manufactured
sold last batch (No.5080263A) of Salazopyrin tablets
500mg in November, 2013 and; therefore, no further
batches will be imported and marketed in future. Which
clearly suggests that much prior to the alleged shortage, the
company informed the authorities qua the non-supply of

the drugs in question in the market; therefore, they could
am eae de

not be charged for the alleged shortage if any under the
law.

12. Record also reveals that in complaint Dr. Farid
Khan, Managing Director/CEO M/s Pfizer Pakistan (Pvt)
Ltd, was nominated as an accused; albeit, subsequently,
name of present appellant S.M Wajeehuddin had been
substituted as an accused on the ground that he replaced
Dr. Farid Khan, who ceased to be the chief executive of
the company; which clearly transpires that during the
period of alleged shortage, appellant was not the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company. Therefore, neither, he
could be substituted against Dr. Farid Khan, nor, could he
be held responsible for alleged shortage. Likewise his
criminal culpability could not be shifted to the present
appellant after his assuming charge of Chief Executive of
the Company.

13. So far as, contention of learned AAG regarding
Criminal Culpability of every member of the company qua
the offence is concerned; true that under the provisions of
Section 34 of Drug Act 1976; if a person guilty of an

offence under ibid Act is a company, corporation or firm;
then, every director, partner or officer of the said company,
corporation or firm, with whose knowledge and consent
the offence is committed, shall be guilty of the offence.
Albeit, the ibid provision has placed emphasis upon the
knowledge and consent of the director, partner or officer of
the said company, corporation or firm, qua the offence;
which under the law shall be proved by the prosecution,
howbeit, the same is not the case here. Therefore, the ibid
provision is not attracted to the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the instant case, as, neither, prosecution
could establish its case against the company, nor, it could
prove knowledge or consent of its directors or officers in
the alleged offence.

In view of what has been discussed above, the
instant appeal is allowed and; the convict/appellant is
acquitted from the charge by setting aside the impugned
judgment.
