AHMAD ALL, J:- Abdur Razzaq, appellant/
complainant has called in question the acquittal of
accused/respondent, Irfan Ahmad, in case F.I.R No.
248 dated 04.04.2013 under Section 302 PPC of PS
Mir Pur, District Abbottabad, vide impugned
judgment dated 02.05.2019 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-VI/Model Court, Abbottabad by filing
instant appeal under section 417 (A-2) Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the
complainant/appellant, Abdur Razzaq, reported the
matter to the local police on 04.04.2013 at 10.30 AM
alongwith dead body of his sister, Mst. Nasreen Gul
in Police Post, Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad,

alleging therein that in the morning at 08.00 AM, he
was present on his duty at English Biscuits Factory,
Hattar, Haripur, when he received information
through telephone that his sister was killed and her
dead body was lying in Ayub Teaching Hospital,
Abbottabad; that he reached ATH, Abbottabad and
found the dead body of his sister in Emergency Ward,
who was killed by strangulation having signs of rope
on his neck; that on query, he came to know that his
sister was sleeping in home at night and in the
morning her dead body was found on bed; he charged
her husband, Muhammad Ishaq, stepson Asmat Ullah
and stepdaughter, Safia Bibi. No motive was disclosed
by the complainant in his report.

3: During investigation, accused/respondent
Irfan Ahmad was arrested, who made confessional
statement before the Magistrate, wherein, he also
charged one Naila, co-accused for commission of the
offence. Subsequently, the complainant charged the
accused/respondent, Irfan Ahmad and co-accused
Niaila and exonerated the accused charged in the
report. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted in the Court of Sessions for

trial against acquitted accused/respondent Irfan
Ahmad, and acquitted co-accused Mst. Naila. Where,
after completion of codal formalities charge was
framed to which the accused/respondent pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the
prosecution examined seventeen witnesses and
statement of accused/respondent Irfan Ahmad was
also recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he
denied the allegations of the prosecution leveled
against him in this case. However, he wished not to
produce defence or to appear on Oath as his own
witness within the contemplation of section 340(2)
Cr.P.C. The learned trial Court, after hearing the
arguments of learned counsel for the parties, acquitted
the accused/respondent vide impugned
judgment/order dated 02/05/2019. Hence, the present
appeal.

4. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
appellant heard. Record perused.

5; Perusal of record reveals that initially the
complainant charged three persons in his report, who
were later on during investigation of the case were
exonerated by him and_ instead acquitted

accused/respondent, Irfan Ahmad and co-acquitted
accused, Mst. Naila were charged by him in his
supplementary statement and that too after
confessional statement of the accused/respondent
Irfan Ahamad, whereas, the accused charged in the
report were made witnesses in the case. The
prosecution in order to establish its case against the
acquitted accused/respondent has relied upon the
statements of complainant Abdur Razzaq (PW-11),
Molvi Muhammad Ishaque (PW-12), Mst. Safia Ishaq
(PW-13), who appeared and furnished their testimony
as eyewitnesses of the occurrence, medical evidence
furnished by Lady Doctor Sadia, Women Medical
Officer (PW-9), who conducted postmortem of
deceased Mst. Nasreen Bibi, Ehtisham-ul-Haq
Danishmand, Judicial Magistrate (PW-10), who
recorded confessional statement of accused/
respondent Irfan Ahmad, Sajjad Ahmad (PW-16)
marginal witness to recovery memo Ex.PW 15/9
through which crime ropes (Ex.P-2) and (Ex.P-3)
were recovered and Khurram Shahzad (PW-17),
witness of pointation memo alongwith other formal

witnesses.
6. Admittedly, the complainant is not an
eyewitness of the occurrence. He was _ initially
informed on telephone about the murder of the
deceased Mst. Nasreen Bibi, his sister, however, he
did not disclose as to who informed him about the
occurrence and this fact remained unrevealed during
entire evidence of the prosecution. The version of the
prosecution, as mentioned in F.I.R, referred to above,
was that the occurrence took place in between the
night of 03-04 April, 2013, whereas, the report was
lodged on 04.04.2013 at 10.30 A.M. Asmatullah and
Mst. Safia Bibi, who were initially charged as
accused, were subsequently become eyewitnesses of
the occurrence. Admittedly, no effort was made to
lodge report by the husband or stepson or
stepdaughter of the deceased. PW-13, Mst. Safia
Ishaq and PW-14, Asmat Ullah furnished their
testimony as an eyewitness of the occurrence, who
deposed in their Court statements that on 04.04.2013
they were sleeping in their room, when their father
asked them to get up for ‘Fajar’ prayer and her father
left the house for ‘Masjid’. She noticed some hue and

cry/voice from the room of their mother, they went
towards the room of their mother, when they reached
there, accused/respondent Irfan Ahmad, who is their
paternal cousin, was putting rope around the neck of
their mother. On seeing him, accused/respondent took
out the rope from the neck of his mother.
Accused/respondent caught hold of Asmatullah and
threatened them not to disclose the occurrence to
anyone, else he would kill them and thereafter he ran
away. Asmatullah (PW-14) informed his father in
‘Masjid’ and his father in the company of Professor
Mushtaq Ahmad (PW-6) came to the house and they
took her mother to the hospital, where they came to
know that their mother had expired. They narrated
the whole story to their father and their father tried to
inform Abdur Razzaq, their maternal uncle but he was
angry and did not listen to his father and he lodged
report against them. However, when this Court
examined the evidence of both the eyewitnesses, it
become clear that they informed the police about the
commission of the offence by accused/respondent
Irfan Ahmad on the day of occurrence but their
statements and the statement of Abdur Razzaq,

complainant, under section 161 Cr.P.C were recorded
after delay of about nine days on 13.04.2013 and no
explanation in this regard is furnished by the
prosecution. Such delay could not be ignored in
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. The
statements of the alleged eyewitnesses were also
contradictory with each other in material particulars.
The minute analysis of the entire evidence on record,
suggests that the occurrence had not taken place in the
mode and manner as alleged by the prosecution. The
witnesses have given an exaggerated account of the
occurrence by involving two persons therein, as there
were no corroboration to their testimony from any
independent source, therefore, their deposition could
not be relied upon for safe administration of justice.
Reliance can be placed on PLD 1980 SC 2011, 1996
SCMR 1411, 1998 SCMR 1823, PLD 2003 SC 14,
2007 SCMR 670 and 2011 SCMR 323.

7. According to the F.I.R, time of occurrence
was shown to be midnight in between 3-4 April, 2013,
while report was lodged on 04.04.2013 at 10.30 AM.
Postmortem was conducted by the doctor on 4.4.2013
at 11.00 AM. It has been mentioned in the PM report

that time between death and postmortem was within
12-15 hours. PW-9 Lady Doctor admitted during
cross-examination that: Jt is correct that death might
had been occurred at about 11 P.M of 03/04/2013 or
8 PM of even date. It is correct that it is not my
personal opinion that death was occurred in between
8to I] PM of 03/04/2013 but it is the biological
changes in the body after the death which suggest the
time of death. It is correct that it is not possible at all
that rigor mortis would develop within 4, 5 or 6 hours
after the death. The bruises and injuries on the body
of deceased lady qua bruises and laceration suggest
that deceased lady was subjected to torture prior to
her death by strangulation. According to medical
jurisprudence written by Modi and Parikh, the rigor
mortis starts developing on dead body after 3 hours of
death and completes within12 hours and remains for
next 12 hours, so it means that the time of death was
not the same as mentioned in the F.I.R. This fact is
further strengthened by the statement of PW-9 who
mentioned time between death and postmortem as 12-
15 hours. So by calculation the time of death comes
as 11.PM at night, while at that time husband of the

deceased lady was with her, as such, in this peculiar
situation how accused could murder the deceased
lady. Thus, the story narrated by complainant is
highly doubtful and medical evidence totally negates
the prosecution version. Reliance is placed on 2015
YLR 2498.

8. Now coming to the confessional
statement of the accused/respondent, Irfan Ahmad,
recorded by Judicial Magistrate (PW-10) on
09.04.2013. In his statement accused/respondent
stated that he was in love with co-accused Mst. Naila
Bibi and he asked the deceased for marriage with her,
however, the deceased did not agree with his
proposal, as such, in order to remove the hurdle from
his way, he killed her by strangulation and at the time
of commission of offence, some voice created from
his mouth, as a result, Asmatullah, son of deceased
woke up and he threatened him not to disclose the
occurrence to anyone, otherwise he would kill him.
However, the learned Judicial Magistrate did not
observe the procedural formalities before recording
the confessional statement, as no second warning was
given to accused to ponder over the mater and he was

also handed over to Naib Court for onward
10

transmission to judicial custody, thus, such statement
could not be held to be voluntary. The learned trial
Court has discussed in detail all the aspects relating to
voluntariness of the confessional statement and has
rightly discarded this piece of evidence. The recovery
of two pieces of crime rope from inside the
kitchen/mess of poultry farm and from an open
ground of Army is not believable and the evidence of
the witnesses in this regard are also not confidence
inspiring. Accused person could not be convicted on
the sole ground of retracted judicial confession
without corroboration from independent evidence.
Reference can be made to case law reported as 2015
SCMR 856, PLD 2015 Peshawar 01 and 2015 YLR
1448.

9. In view of above discussions, it is
crystal clear that the case of the prosecution is full of
doubts and the statements of the complainant and
eyewitness are contradictory on material particulars,
which create serious doubts about the mode and
manner of the occurrence and veracity of the
testimony furnished by the alleged eyewitnesses. As

such, the learned trial court has rightly acquitted the
11

accused/ respondent and its judgment does not need to
be interfered with by this Court in its Appellate
Jurisdiction.

10. It is well settled law that even a single doubt,
if found reasonable, would entitle the accused person

to acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.

Reliance is placed on case titled Ghulam Qadir Vs.

The State (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held
that:

“Tt needs no reiteration that for the
purpose of giving benefit of doubt to
an accused person, more than one
infirmity is not required, a_ single
infirmity crating reasonable doubt in
the mind of a reasonable and prudent
mind regarding the truth of charge-
makers the whole case doubtful.
Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does
not absolve the prosecution to prove
its case against the accused beyond
any shadow of doubt in this duty does

,

not change or vary in the case.’

Reliance is also placed on case law reported as 1992

SCMR 366, 1995 SCMR 1345, 1995 SCMR 1730,

2004 SCMR 215, 2004 SCMR_ 140, 2009 SCMR
12

230, 2013 SCMR 192, 2016 SCMR 2073, 2016 PSC

(Criminal) 612, 2017 PSC (Criminal) 14, and 2017

SCM R 986.

11. Accordingly, for the reasons _ stated
hereinabove, this Court is of the considered view that
the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond any
reasonable doubt against the accused/respondent,
hence, the instant appeal being devoid of substance is

hereby dismissed in /imine.
