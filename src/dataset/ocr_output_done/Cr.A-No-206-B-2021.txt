SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Through this appeal,

the appellant has called in question judgment dated
30.11.2021 passed by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Lakki Marwat in case FIR No.422 dated
09.12.2009 under sections 302 / 324 / 427 / 148 / 149
PPC of Police Station Tajori, Lakki Marwat, whereby, he
was convicted and sentenced as under:

i. under section 302(b)/149 PPC to imprisonment
for life on three counts alongwith payment of
Rs.2,00,000/- as compensation under section
544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of each
deceased or in default thereof, to undergo six
months simple imprisonment;

ii. under section 324/149 PPC to five years
rigorous imprisonment alongwith fine of
Rs.50,000/- or in default thereof, to undergo

iil. under section 337-F(iii) PPC to two years
rigorous imprisonment alongwith payment of
Rs.10,000/- as Daman for causing hurt to
Habib-ur-Rehman;

iv.under section 148/149 PPC to two years
rigorous imprisonment and under section
427/149 PPC to two years rigorous
imprisonment.

2. Benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended
to the appellant and the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently.

3. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has questioned the
legality of the impugned judgment and the awarded
sentences through the instant appeal, whereas,
complainant Habib ur Rehman being aggrieved of the
quantum of sentences, has moved Criminal Revision
No.49-B of 2021 for enhancement of the same. Since
both the matters have arisen out of the same judgment,
therefore, we intend to decide the same through this
common judgment.

4. The brief facts of the case are that on 09.12.2009 at
18:10 hours, complainant Habib-ur-Rehman, in injured
condition, brought the dead bodies of deceased to Police
Station Tajori in a tractor and lodged a report to the effect
that on the day of occurrence, at 16:00 hours, he
alongwith his brothers named Mujeeb-ur-Rehman &

Hazrat Gul, nephew Saddam and one Haqdad went in a

tractor to their landed property situated at Lora to
-3-

cultivate wheat. On returning back, when they reached
near Ziarat Mullah Bakhtiar at about 16:30 hours, they
saw the accused duly armed with Kalashnikovs, already
waylaid in ditches & canyons (Kurrajat) and as soon as
they reached near them, the accused _ started
indiscriminate firing at them, due to which, complainant,
Hazrat Gul, Saddam and Haqdad got hit. Complainant
injured, whereas, his brother Hazrat Gul, nephew Saddam
and Haqdad succumbed to their injuries, while Mujeeb ur
Rehman escaped unhurt, luckily. Motive is alleged to be a
dispute over landed property. Hence, the ibid FIR.

5. It is pertinent to mention that initially, the appellant
Hamayun was tried by the learned trial Court and was
convicted & sentenced to death vide judgment dated
09.12.2017. In appeal before this court, the said judgment
was set aside, murder reference was answered in negative
and the case was remanded to the trial Court to examine
Imam Muhammad Khan ASHO, subject to cross
examination by the defence, record statement of the
accused within the meaning of section 342 Cr.P.C and
provide the parties with an opportunity of hearing and
thereafter, to pass the judgment afresh, in accordance
with law vide judgment dated 21.09.2021 passed in
Criminal Appeal No.258-B/2017. In compliance with the

judgment of this Court, the learned Additional Sessions
-4-

Judge-II, Lakki Marwat recorded the statement of Imam
Muhammad Khan as RPW-01. Statement of the appellant
/ accused was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C,
wherein, he professed innocence and false implication.
He opted to be examined on oath as provided under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C and wished to produce defence
evidence as well. So, in his defence, the appellant
produced defence witnesses. After hearing arguments, the
learned trial Court vide the impugned judgment,
convicted and sentenced the appellant Hamayun, as
mentioned above.

6. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
learned A.A.G were heard at length and with their
valuable assistance, the record was gone through.

7. A tragedy where three innocent souls were done to
death and one got injured occurred on 09.12.2009. The
matter was reported by the injured eye witness Habib ur
Rehman when he brought the dead bodies of the deceased
to Police Station Tajori. The report was made to one
Imam Muhammad Khan, the scribe, who was examined
as RPW-01. After registration of the case, the injury
sheets and inquest reports of the deceased were prepared
and thereafter, the dead bodies were sent to the doctor for
postmortem examination. The investigating officer after

receiving copy of the FIR, visited the spot and on
-5-

pointation of the eye witness, namely, Mujeeb-ur-
Rehman, prepared the site plan. During spot inspection,
the investigating officer collected eight empties from two
different places, where the accused were shown present
and bloodstained earth was collected from the driving
seat of the tractor and from the respective places of the
deceased, to which they fell after receiving firearm
injuries. The tractor was taken to the police station, it was
taken into possession and the same was got examined
from an auto mechanic to assess the damage caused. Out
of the accused, the appellant was arrested under section
54 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 and was put
behind the bars, wherefrom he was formally arrested and
in that respect, his card of arrest was prepared. The
convict / appellant faced trial, who was convicted vide
judgment dated 09.12.2017, against which, criminal
appeal No. 258-B/2017 was moved in this Court and after
hearing the parties, this august Court was pleased to set
aside the impugned judgment with certain directions to
the learned trial Court. After doing the needful, the
learned trial Court was convinced regarding the
involvement of the appellant in the tragic incident and
vide the impugned judgment, the appellant was convicted

as stated above. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant
-6-

approached this Court through the instant criminal
appeal.

8. We are conscious of the fact that in the instant
case, as many as three persons lost their lives and one got
injured. We understand the agonies of the prosecution
and that of the bereaved families who were the worst
sufferers. This was a tragedy where the assault led to the
brutal killings of three innocent souls including a minor
boy aging 12 years. There is no denial to the fact that
every criminal case has a sad story to tell and that the
attending circumstances of the cases shocks one’s mind
to the extreme, but this alone cannot be considered a
determining factor to determine the fate of the parties
involved. If on one hand, the families of those who lose
their lives are the worst sufferers, then on the other, the
accused charged and his family is also expecting fair trial
from the courts of law; to be more specific, the courts of
law are to travel with caution between the parties
involved, as any favour to any of the side will frustrate
the ends of justice and that’s why the courts must be
balanced in its approach in dilating upon the fates of all
concerned, as that is the only remedy provided by the
criminal jurisprudence. In the present case, the learned
trial Court appreciated the available record and the

recorded statements of the witnesses and _ thereafter,
-7-

through a comprehensive judgment, convicted the
appellant for the offences he is charged with. Though, the
learned trial Court took pain to dilate upon the material
aspects of the case and after application of judicial mind
to the attending circumstances of the present case,
convicted the appellant, yet keeping before the complex
circumstances of the present case, we, while sitting in
appeal, feel it our obligation to re-assess and re-
appreciate the already assessed and appreciated evidence,
so that miscarriage of justice could be avoided. If on one
side, we have three deceased and one injured before us,
then on the other, seven accused of one and the same
family have been charged for the deaths of the deceased.
Keeping before the number of casualties and the number
of accused charged, we are to assess as to whether it was
the act of seven accused charged or that the number of
accused has been exaggerated. Keeping in view the
number of accused, it is the bounden duty of this Court to
explore the unexplored avenues of this case so to exclude
the possibility of convicting the innocent and acquitting
the guilty. No doubt, the matter was promptly reported,
that too, by an injured eye witness, but the same alone is
not sufficient to give the true picture of the incident. We
must take extra care to walk in the given circumstances of

the present case, as any decision rendered in haste would
-8-

yield to drastic results which has never been and is not
the intent and purpose behind the appreciation of
evidence. We do accept that for reaching to a just and
proper conclusion, it is a must to revisit the entire case
and re-appreciate the available evidence on file.

9. The unfortunate incident allegedly occurred at
04:30pm, when the complainant, the eye witness and the
deceased were returning home back after cultivating their
fields. The place of incident is an unpaved path leading to
the fields of the deceased from their houses and on either
side of the thoroughfare, there are canyons (Kurajat). The
site plan depicts that at the time of incident, the appellant
alongwith his co-accused were present near the canyons
(Kurajat) duly armed. It was reported by the complainant
that no sooner they reached to the place of incident, the
accused started indiscriminate firing at them, which
resulted in the deaths of the deceased and to an injury on
his body. We are to see as to whether the complainant
alongwith the eye witness was present on the spot; and as
to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner and
at the stated time; and as to whether the incident occurred
at 04:30pm and soon thereafter, the dead bodies were
shifted to the police station where the report was made
and as to whether the witnesses witnessed the occurrence.

There is no denial to the fact that from the place of
-9-

incident, bloodstained earth was taken into possession by
the investigating officer and also, the damaged tractor
was taken to the police station, where a report was sought
from the auto mechanic. There is no denial to the fact that
from two different places, eight empties of 7.62 bore
were taken into possession, but what is important in this
particular case is to ascertain as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time.
When the report of the complainant is read in
juxtaposition with the places assigned to the deceased and
the tractor in the site plan, it disturbs the judicial mind of
this Court, as at the time of incident, the tractor was
allegedly moving from north to south with its right
exposed to the assailants. This is interesting to note that
lesser damage was caused to the tractor on its right,
whereas, greater damage has been noticed by the
mechanic as well as the investigating officer on its left,
more particularly, its left rear tyre was burst due to
receiving great number of fire shots. We are to assess as
to whether while firing from extreme right, the damage
caused and noted was possible. We are yet to ascertain as
to whether the seat of injuries on persons of the deceased
find support from the physical circumstances of the case,
more particularly, when the accused were shown present

on the extreme right. In order to resolve the controversy,
-10-

we deem it essential to go through the statements of the
complainant and the eye witness, as they are in a better
position to tell that when they left their houses, when they
reached to the fields, when they cultivated the fields and
how they reached to the place of incident? The
complainant was examined as PW-10 who stated that on
the day of incident, he alongwith the eye witness and the
deceased left their house to cultivate the uncultivated
portion of land; that they left their house at 03:45pm and
reached to the field at 04:00pm; that after cultivating the
remaining portion of the land, they started back for their
houses in the tractor and that it was about 04:30pm that
they reached to the place of incident; that no sooner did
they reach to the place of occurrence, the assailants
including the appellant were already present in trench
duly armed and on noticing their presence on the spot, the
accused stood up and started indiscriminate firing which
resulted to the deaths of the deceased and injury on his
body; that the dead bodies remained on the spot for an
hour and thereafter, through another tractor and trolley,
the dead bodies were shifted to the local police station,
where the matter was reported. The witness was cross
examined on material aspects of the case, where he went
with dishonest improvements and he was also confronted

with his report, where several inconsistencies are found.
-ll-

The record tells and so admitted by the complainant that
the field to which they were going to cultivate was
situated at a distance of 3/4km from their houses. We are
yet to know that when the complainant alongwith the
deceased left their house at 03:45pm, how they reached
within 15 minutes to the field and how they succeeded to
cultivate the same by 04:00pm. This mechanical
explanation and performance of the complainant and
others ask us to intervene and assess the veracity of the
witness as to whether the leaving of the house, reaching
to the field, cultivating the same and returning to the spot
was possible in that time; it is hard to appeal to a prudent
mind. For this particular purpose, we went through the
inquest reports prepared by the scribe after the report was
made, but surprisingly, in all the three reports, the time
regarding death mentioned in the relevant column has
been tampered, which on naked eye, comes to be 18:30
instead of 16:30 hours. This tampering has never been
explained by the scribe and as such, it attained a legal
status which this Court is under the obligation to
appreciate. To ascertain as to what should be the exact
time of occurrence, we feel it essential to read the opinion
rendered by the doctor alongwith the inquest reports
prepared by the scribe and the statements of the eye

witnesses recorded before the trial Court. An attempt was
-12-

made by the complainant as well as the eye witness to
bring their statements in line with the inquest reports and
the opinion of the doctor. The record tells that the doctor,
during postmortem examination, mentioned the time
between the injury and death as one to two hours,
whereas, the complainant, during his Court statement,
stated that the dead bodies remained on the spot for an
hour and thereafter, those were shifted to the police
station in a tractor and trolley arranged by their relatives.
The complainant while reporting the matter, left no
ambiguity in telling that the deceased soon after receiving
firearm injuries fell to the ground and breathed their last.
If the doctor was correct in his opinion regarding the time
between the injury and death then the complainant should
have disclosed the same, but after realizing the delay
caused in reporting the matter, an attempt was made to
convince this Court in holding that in fact, the incident
occurred at 04:30pm and the matter was reported at
06:10pm. We cannot lose sight of the fact that the
incident occurred in the month of December and if we
take the initial mentioned time in the inquest report to be
correct then by the time, the darkness had already
prevailed and this was for the witness to tell that how
could they identify the accused while present at a

considerable distance.
-13-

10. The record tells that the place of incident is an
abandoned thoroughfare with ditches and steeps on its
either side. We are yet to know that when the accused had
the intention to commit the murders of the deceased, then
what forced them to expose themselves to enable the
complainant and the eye witness to identify them, as the
accused were allegedly present near the canyons
(Kurajat), that too, duly Morchazan. The conduct
displayed by the accused does not appeal to a prudent
mind. The eye witness was examined as PW-11, who
though, narrated the events in the same fashion as were
disclosed by the complainant, but this witness too went in
abnormal improvements with the utmost attempt to bring
his case in line with the site plan and the medical
evidence. The complainant while reporting the matter
stated that when they reached to the place of incident, the
accused started indiscriminate firing, which resulted in
the casualties, whereas, during his Court statement, he
improved this part of his statement and stated that all the
accused fired in a single manner. The accused charged
are seven in number duly armed with Kalashnikovs, but
interestingly, the investigating officer succeeded in
collecting eight empties of 7.62 bore from two different
places. As the place is deserted and nobody was present

around, then why the investigating officer succeeded in
-14-

collecting only eight empties of 7.62 bore despite the fact
that the complainant stated that soon after firing, the
accused decamped from the spot. The number of injuries
on persons of the deceased and that on the complainant
further increases the anxiety of this Court regarding the
involvement of seven persons in the episode. When there
was indiscriminate firing, then why greater damage was
not caused to the tractor in question and that why instead
of getting its right rear tyre burst, the left one received the
fire shots. There is still prevailing the atmosphere of
uncertainty regarding the credibility of the witnesses and
the manner in which the incident occurred. The
investigating officer collected bloodstained earth from the
tractor, but he never mentioned as to whether the same
were taken into possession from the driving seat or other
parts of the tractor. The deceased and the complainant
were shown initially present in the tractor at the time of
firing and after receiving firearm injuries, they fell to the
ground and in the site plan, both the places i.e. the initial
places, where they were present before firing and the
latter to which they fell after receiving firearm injuries.
The design of the driving seat in a tractor is of such a
nature that the driver while driving the tractor is sitting
duly sunk with his feet extended on either side and there

is hardly an occasion that after receiving firearm injuries,
-15-

the driver would fall to the ground. This aspect of the
case has further troubled the judicial mind of this Court in
holding as to whether the driver received firearm injuries
while sitting on the driving seat or he received the same
while present on the ground. When the tractor was taken
to the auto mechanic for its physical examination, no
spent bullet was extracted therefrom. The cumulative
effect of what has been stated above leads this Court to
hold that the incident did not occur in the mode, manner
and at the stated time. Another important aspect of the
case is that most of the deceased received firearm injuries
either on their left or on their right chest with its exit on
the right. In order to appreciate this particular aspect of
the case, we deem it essential to look into the respective
places of the deceased they were occupying at the time of
firing. One of the deceased was shown occupying the
extreme left of the driver with his face exposed to the
accused, whereas, the other was shown seated on the rear
plank located just behind the driving seat with his face
facing south, whereas, the complainant is shown sitting
on the plough of the tractor with his right exposed to the
assailants, but the injuries caused on their bodies do not
find support from the site plan, as in case of the deceased
sitting on extreme left of the driver, would have received

firearm injuries on his chest, whereas, the one sitting on
-16-

the plank would have received the same on his right, but
the physical circumstances of the case do not support the
stance of the complainant in particular and that of the
prosecution in general. The investigating officer did not
visit the fields, which a little earlier, the complainant
party had cultivated and even, no documentary evidence
was collected in that respect to tell that the landed
property was owned by the complainant. The
investigating officer appeared before the Court as PW-09,
who was cross examined on material aspects of the case,
but on one hand, admitted that he did not visit the fields,
where the complainant side had gone to cultivate and that
he did not record the statements of independent witnesses
in that respect. Though, one Muhammad Khan was
examined as PW-06, who stated that there was a dispute
over landed property between the parties and the matter
had been patched up in old good days and that the parties
after satisfying each other on special oath, pledged to
avoid differences in that respect, but apart from PW-06,
no independent witness came forward to support the same
and as such, the same cannot be taken into consideration
to hold the accused responsible for the episode. When the
Court finds inconsistencies, contradictions and
improvements in the prosecution evidence and when it

reaches to a conclusion that the occurrence has not taken
-17-

place in the mode and manner as alleged and presented
by the prosecution then the benefit has always been
extended to the accused charged. In this regard, wisdom
can be derived case laws reported as “Jawad Vs The
State and another” (2020 YLR 1462) and “Jalat Khan
alias Jalo Vs The State” (2020 PCrLJ 503).

11. The presence of the eye witness does not spell out
from the record, which further gets support from his
statement recorded before the trial Court, where he stated
that though, he put his thumb impression on the report
made by the complainant, but the same was not read over
to him. This portion of the statement of the eye witness
has put us on guard regarding his presence at the time of
report, as he did not disclose that the complainant
reported the matter in his immediate presence, so there is
every likelihood that the same was made in his absence. It
was incumbent upon the police official, who registered
the first information report to have explained the details
provided by the complainant in his report to the eye
witness.

12. The prime question for this Court to determine is
as to whether the net has been thrown wide and that all
the male members of the family were charged with
ulterior motives. In order to appreciate this particular

aspect of the case, we deem it essential to discuss the
-18-

inter se relationship between the accused. This has been
brought on record that the accused are closely related to
one another in the capacity of nephews, cousins and
brothers, but the prosecution could not succeed in
creating link of each / individual accused to the disputed
property. The site plan depicts that the accused at the time
of firing were present to the extreme right of the deceased
in a row at two different places. The matter can better be
understood when the seat of injuries both on the deceased
and the tractor are taken into consideration with the
places assigned to the accused at the time of firing. As is
evident from the site plan, if the accused present at points
No.9, 10, 11 & 12 would fire, then in that eventuality, the
tractor must have received bullet marks on its front and
major damage would have been caused, but the record
does not support the stance of the complainant. If the
accused at the above stated points would fire on the
deceased, then the dimension and the locale of injuries
would fall in harmony with the directions of the fire shots
made by the accused from their respective places, but
even, in that respect, we failed to find any harmony
between the witnesses and the record. There is no denial
to the fact that during spot inspection, the investigating
officer collected eight empties of 7.62 bore from the

places assigned to both the groups of the accused, but we
-19-

are yet to know that when the accused had gathered
together to eliminate the complainant side, then why such
a limited number of empties were procured from the spot
despite the fact that the spot after the occurrence was
under the control of the complainant party and that being
a deserted area, there was no chance of its misplacing.
The mode and manner coupled with the seat of injuries
on the bodies of the deceased as well as the complainant
help us in forming an opinion that the participation of all
the seven accused charged does not appeal to a prudent
mind and even, the same is not possible. If the eye
witness was available at the time of occurrence, then he
would have received firearm injuries, as rest of the people
did, but his escaping unhurt is another factor, which
overshadows the clarity and right from the beginning till
the end, the mist regarding the involvement of seven
accused in the incident could not be removed. We do not
doubt the place of incident, the deaths of innocent souls
and an injury on the body of the complainant, but we are
not ready to accept that it was the doing of all the seven
accused charged. When such an atmosphere is created,
then it is the bounden duty of the courts of law to rescue
the innocent and to punish the guilty. As all the accused
charged are given the role of effective fire shots, so it is

hard to determine the individual liability and participation
-20-

of each individual accused. Once the Court comes to a
conclusion that the number of accused is exaggerated and
once it forms an opinion from the attending
circumstances of a particular case that the act committed
was the doing of a limited number of accused then the
exaggerated charge brought by the complainant will react
upon the veracity and authenticity of the collected
material and recorded statements. Since immemorial, it
has been held that better to acquit ten culprits than to
convict an innocent soul. Both the English Jurisprudence
as well as our religion are in consonance on this
particular aspect of acquittal and conviction. We went
through the relevant record as keen observers, but could
not lay hands on any concrete evidence which could
convince that all the accused charged are responsible for
the deaths of the deceased and injury to the complainant.
When a stage comes, where it becomes impossible that
who, out of the accused charged, committed the offence,
then the courts are left with limited option to fix the
liability and in such eventuality, the benefit of the same is
always extended to all the accused charged and the
present case is no exception. Once Court comes to a
conclusion that the number of accused has been
exaggerated, then extra care and caution is required to be

taken while appraising the evidence. In this respect,
-21-

wisdom can be derived from the judgment rendered by
the Apex Court in case titled “Muhammad Zaman Vs
The State and others” (2014 SCMR 749) wherein it was
held that:
“The number of assailants in the
circumstances of the case appears to
have been exaggerated. It seems that
most of the persons including the
respondents have been charged
because of previous enmity. The
tragedy may have been enacted by
Mukhtar who has gone into hiding
or Munawar who has been acquitted
because the deceased Shabbir was
alleged to have illicit relations with
their sister, but many who have no
visible nexus with this part of the
story have also been roped in. It is so
because it is customary in this part of
the country to throw wide the net of
implication to rope in all those who
could possibly pursue the case or do
something to save the skin of the one
who is innocent or who is actually

responsible for the commission of the
-22-

crime. The Court, therefore, is

required to exercise much greater

care and_ circumspection while

appraising evidence.”
13. As the number of injuries also do _ not
commensurate with the number of accused charged and
prima facie, the net appears to have been thrown wide, so
this aspect nullifies the mode and manner as alleged and
presented by the prosecution, which, in turn, reacts qua
the involvement of accused in the commission of offence.
In this regard, wisdom can also be derived from the
judgment rendered in case titled “Malik Aamir Sultan
and 02 others Vs The State and another” (2018 MLD
1635) wherein it was held that:

The number of injuries does not

commensurate with the number of

accused party. More so, all the

injuries bear one and the same

dimension. It reflects that it is the job

of one person but in order to throw

the net wide, the number of accused

has been exaggerated as three

brothers and two unknown accused

have been charged. The empties

recovered were not sent in order to
-23-

ascertain whether the same were

fired from one or different weapons.

What was the reason that this

opinion was not sought by the

Investigating Officer, the answer of

that is not available on the record of

the case and it can be presumed that

the Investigating Officer was

conscious of the fact that number of

the accused has been exaggerated

and if such report is sought, that

would be detrimental to the case of

the prosecution. Thus, there is

element of concealment and

exaggeration as well which further

nullifies the mode and manner as set

out by the prosecution.
14. Keeping in view the recovery of limited number of
crime empties, the number of injuries, the number of
bullets which hit the tractor and the surrounding facts of
the present case, it can safely be held that the act was not
the job of seven accused, who too are shown to have fired
indiscriminately through their respectively Kalashnikovs.
Had seven assailants started indiscriminate firing through

Kalashnikovs as alleged by the prosecution, the result
-24-

would have been more drastic than the present one. At
this juncture, we would like to make reference to a
judgment passed in case titled “Pasand Khan Vs The
State” (2011 YLR 1664 Peshawar) where the Court, on
having come to a conclusion that the offence committed
was not the act of three accused, but the job of a single
person, extended the benefit of doubt to the accused and
acquitted him of the charges.

15. The medical evidence does not support the stance
of the complainant and both the ocular account and the
medical evidence is in conflict with each other. As
discussed in the earlier part of this judgment, the seat of
injuries on persons of the deceased and that of the
complainant does not find support from the site plan. As
the site plan depicts that at the time of firing, the accused
were present on the extreme right and that one of the
deceased, who was sitting to the extreme left of the
driver, was facing the accused and in such eventuality, he
would have received firearm entry wounds on his chest
with their exit on his back, but the situation is otherwise.
Similarly, the seat of injuries on person of the driver, who
was occupying the driving seat of the tractor, also
contradicts the statement of the complainant. We cannot
ignore that one of the deceased was sitting just behind the

driver on a wooden plank with his face exposed to the
-25-

assailants, but even, the seat of injuries on his body do
not find support from the places assigned to the accused
including the appellant. Though, medical evidence is
confirmatory in nature and in presence of trustworthy and
confidence inspiring eye witness account, it cannot
overshadow the same, but in case where the eye witness
account fails to convince on a particular aspect of the
case, then the conflict between the two would creep down
to the roots. As in the present case, the testimony of the
complainant regarding the mode, manner and the number
of accused charged does not convince the judicial mind of
this Court, so this Court lurks no doubt in mind that the
conflict between the ocular account and the medical
evidence has damaged the prosecution case beyond
repair. Even the time mentioned by the doctor between
the injury and death contradicts the very statements of the
witnesses and as such, its cumulative effect can be read
only and only in favour of the appellant, that too, at the
cost of the prosecution. In case titled “Najaf Ali shah Vs
the State (2021 SCMR 736), it is held that:
“The same view was reiterated in
Abdul Jabbar v. State (2010 SCMR
129) when this court observed that
once a single loophole is observed

in a case presented by the

prosecution, such as conflict in the
ocular account and medical
evidence or presence of eye-
witnesses being doubtful, the
benefit of such loopholeAacuna in
the prosecution's case
automatically goes in favour of an
accused.”
16. The record tells that the investigating officer
collected eight empties of 7.62 bore from the place of
incident and the same were sent to the forensic science
laboratory to ascertain as to whether the same were fired
from one or different weapons. Though, the report
received tells that the same were fired from different
weapons, but the same is silent that the collected empties
were fired from seven weapons. Keeping in view the
limited number of empties and the laboratory report, we
are not hesitant to hold that the number of accused is
exaggerated. The investigating officer did not record
statement of the Muharrir in whose custody the same
were lying and even, the police official who took the
same to the laboratory for the purpose, was not examined.
The law is settled that once the safe custody and safe
transmission of the collected empties is not established on

record, then the same cannot be taken into consideration.
-27-

As the prosecution failed to prove its safe custody and
safe transmission, so we are not ready to term the
laboratory report as a valid piece of evidence and the
same is discarded as such. In case titled Hayat Ullah Vs.
The State (2018 SCMR 2092), it was held that:-
“Much reliance was placed on
the recovery of pistol from the
appellant and empty from the place
of occurrence, we observe that the
empty was recovered on 11.02.2006
and pistol was recovered on
22.02.2006 and till the recovery of
the pistol the empty was not sent to
the firearm expert and the empty
and the pistol both remained
together in the Malkhana and
thereafter transmitted to the office
of the Forensic Science Laboratory.
So the recovery is inconsequential.
Even otherwise recovery alone is
not sufficient for conviction and it
is always termed as a corroborative
piece of evidence. It is settled law

that one tainted piece of evidence
-28 -

can't corroborate another tainted
piece of evidence.”
In case titled, “Muhammad Darvaish and others
Vs the State” (2019 PCr.LJ Lahore 1086) it is held that:
“We have also embarked upon
PFSA report (Exh.PP), according
to which guns recovered from
Darvaish and Muhammad Khan
(appellants) were found wedded
with crime empties secured from
spot. However, after having noticed
an anomaly, according to which
prosecution failed to prove the safe
custody and transmission of crime
empties to PFSA, no sanctity can be
attached to the report (Exh.PP).”
17. The complainant while reporting the matter,
alleged the motive to be the landed property dispute, but
the record tells that the parties had resolved their
differences through elders of the locality many years
earlier to the present incident and that the investigating
officer did not record statements of independent
witnesses in that respect. True that PW-06 appeared
before the trial Court and stated that in good old days, the

parties had landed property disputes, but he alongwith
-29-

others intervened and the differences were bridged and
thereafter, the parties were living a happy life. As in the
episode, seven accused of the same family are charged, so
it was essential for the prosecution to have brought on
record the individual interest of every individual accused
in the landed property, which was allegedly shown as the
subject matter of dispute. The record is silent that which
accused had what interest and in such eventuality, we are
not hesitant to hold that there was no common object with
the accused to come to the place of incident duly armed.
When the prosecution failed to convince on this particular
aspect of the case, we lurk no doubt in mind that the
alleged motive could not be proved on record. True that
weakness or absence of motive hardly plays a decisive
role, both in accepting and rejecting the prosecution
story, but in particular cases, it has its importance and in
case of its failure, the prosecution is the worst sufferer.
As the bone of contention between the parties was the
landed property dispute, so it was incumbent upon the
prosecution to have proved the same by bringing
independent witnesses, but it could not and as such, the
involvement of seven accused with the same purpose is
beyond comprehension.

18. It was argued that the appellant remained

absconder for considerable long period with no
-30-

explanation on record and that the same is the strongest
piece of evidence to help in convicting the appellant and
that it was rightly considered by the learned trial Court.
We are not in a happy mood to accede to what was
submitted, as in that eventuality, this Court will venture
in the realm of probabilities with an attempt to change the
standard of appreciation of evidence. As the law is settled
and so held by the superior courts of the country that
abscondance is not the substantive piece of evidence,
rather it is a circumstance which can only be taken into
consideration, provided the prosecution nearly succeeds
in bringing home guilt against the accused charged. As in
the instant case, on one hand, the witnesses went with
dishonest improvements and on the other, the physical
circumstances of the present case do not support the
prosecution story, so in the like situation, mere
abscondence will hardly play a role. When the
prosecution, due to exaggerated charge against the
accused, failed to convince, so we lurk no doubt in mind
that the abscondence alone will hardly turn the dice and
the same hardly attracts our attention.

19. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the
prosecution could not succeed in bringing home guilt

against the appellant and that the impugned judgment is
-31-

suffering from inherent defects, which calls for
interference. The learned trial judge while appreciating
the available record misdirected himself both in law and
on facts of the case. The impugned judgment is,
therefore, set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the
charges, he shall be released forthwith, if not required to
be detained in connection with any other criminal case.
20. As the appeal of the appellant is allowed and he is
acquitted of the charges, so in such eventuality, the
instant Criminal Revision Petition No.49-B/2021 has lost
its efficacy. The same cannot proceed further and is
dismissed as such.

21. The above are the details reasons for our short
order of even date.
