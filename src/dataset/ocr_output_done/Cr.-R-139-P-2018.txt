JUDGMENT

MUSARRAT HILALI, J.- This revision petition is
directed against the order dated 09.11.2018 passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Mardan, whereby
application of respondent/complainant for recording

evidence of PW Ishtiaq through video link was accepted.

2. It is the petitioners’ case that prosecution
filed an application for recording evidence of PW
namely, Ishtiaq through video link under Section 2 of
Electronic Transactions Ordinance read with Article 2(e)
of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order on the ground that the said

witness is an eyewitness of the occurrence and his
statement is necessary to be recorded in the present case.
Record further reveals that the witness was abroad for
earning his livelihood and had come to Pakistan for
recording his statement but owing to strikes and also due
to non-availability of defence counsel, his statement
could not be recorded and he had to go back to Saudi
Arabia for his work. The application was contested by
the petitioners. The learned trial Court after hearing the
parties allowed the application for recording statement of
PW, Ishtiaq through video link vide order dated
09.11.2018, impugned herein.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner
vehemently contended that the impugned order has been
introduced on alien way of recording evidence through
video link which is neither provided in Code of Criminal
Procedure nor in the provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order,1984; He submits that the scheme of Electronic
Transactions Ordinance 2002 provides for dealing with
documentary evidence and not oral; further that the court
proceeding of Saudi Arabia is totally different from the

one in Pakistan including time. Learned counsel
concluded his arguments by stating that the impugned

order being without any legal backing be set aside.

4. As against that, learned AAG assisted by
learned counsel for the respondents submitted that earlier
there was oral communication and the Courts used to
hear the statement/testimony of witnesses and decide
upon the matter; he further submits that thereafter paper
was discovered and the Court of law started recording
and documenting the evidence; that the Criminal
Procedure Code is an ongoing statute, therefore, it must
change with the changing social concepts. Learned
counsel added that even otherwise under Article 2(e),
Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 and
Section 2 of Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002,
recording evidence through video conference is
permissible. He further added that despite the fact that
there was no amendment made in the Criminal Procedure
Code, the Indian Courts adopted the methodology of
Internet facility and started the video connectivity in
almost all the cases. Reliance was placed on case titled

Mian Nawaz Sharif Vs. The State through Chairman
NAB and another (PLD 2018 Islamabad 148) and case
titled Twentieth Century Fox Film Vs. Nri Film
Production Associates (AIR 2003 Kant 148, 2003 (5)
KarLJ 98) delivered by High Court of Karnataka.
Learned counsel further submits that in the instant case
witness is an important witness of the occurrence and is
laborer working in Saudi Arabia, therefore, cannot come
to Pakistan and, therefore, the order of recording

statement through video link be maintained.

Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Basic question that has been raised for
consideration is whether evidence can be recorded by
way of video conference. Before I proceed to consider
this question, it would be appropriate to examine the

relevant provisions of law.

Under Article 2(1) (¢) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,

1984, evidence includes:-

(i) All statements which the Court permits or
requires to be made before it by witness in
relation to matters of fact under inquiry.
Such statements are called oral evidence
and;
(ii) All documents produced for inspection of
the Court, such documents are called
documentary evidence.

Similarly, under the provision of Section 353 Cr.P.C, it is
mandatory that evidence shall be recorded in presence of
accused. For ready reference, Section 353 Cr.P.C is

reproduced as under:-

353. Evidence to be taken in presence of
accused. Except as otherwise expressly
provided, all evidence taken under Chapter
XX, XXI, XXII and XXIIA shall be taken in
the presence of the accused, or, when his
personal attendance is dispensed with, in
presence of his pleader.

The section of law quoted hereinabove laid down
the general principle that the evidence on which the
prosecution proposes to rely for the purpose of framing
of charge as well as for recording conviction must be
recorded in presence of accused or in his absence it shall
be recorded in presence of his counsel. In the instant
case, the complainant moved an application under
Section 2 of Electronic Transactions Ordinance, 2002
read with Article 2(e) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
seeking recording evidence of PW Ishtiaq through video

conference. It was contended that the witness is an eye
witness of the occurrence and his statement is necessary
to be recorded. It was further stated that the witness is
abroad and had come to Pakistan for recording his
statement but owing to strike and non-availability of
defence counsel, his statement could not be recorded, and
now due to his work commitments, the witness cannot

come to Pakistan for recording his evidence.

6. Victim and eye witnesses play a crucial role
in criminal trials. He or she tells the Court what they
have seen or know about the incident. Needless to point
out that the presence of the accused in criminal trial is
must for obvious reasons that the plea of accused in
shape of cross examination of the witness has to be
recorded as is mandated by Section 353 Cr.P.C. So,
therefore, under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure
Code ordinarily evidence against an accused shall be
recorded in his presence in open Court and in presence of
a Judicial Officer so that a fair opportunity is provided to
the accused to cross examine the witness. However,
judicial departure from the established procedure in cases

having special facts and circumstances and due to
compelling reasons such as in rape cases where the girl
under the age of 18 years allegedly subjected to rape or
any other sexual offence, in case of child complainant
and in ATC case, the Courts have taken appropriate
measures to ensure that the woman, child and witness is
not confronted face to face with the accused. The worthy
Additional Advocate General during the course of his
arguments has referred to a judgment rendered by
Hon’ble Islamabad High Court in case titled Mian
Nawaz Sharif Vs. The State through Chairman NAB
and another (PLD 2018 Islamabad 148), wherein the
learned Accountability Court on the application of NAB,
allowed recording the statement of two witnesses namely
Robert W. Radley and Akhtar Raja through video
link/Skype etc. The Hon’ble Islamabad High Court while
maintaining the order of learned Accountability Court,
directed to make arrangement and an authorized
representative/counsel be facilitated so to attend the
proceedings at the time and on the date fixed by

Accountability Court. However, in the said case, the
witnesses ordered to be examined were witnesses of

documents. They were not witnesses of facts.

Another case on which reliance was placed by
worthy Additional Advocate General is the case titled
Twentieth Century Fox Film Vs. Nri Film Production
Associates (AIR 2003 Kant 148, 2003 (5) KarLJ 98)
delivered by high Court of Karnataka (India), wherein, in
a suit between Indian citizen and a United States
Company based in California requested to record the
evidence either by way of Commissioner or audio-video
link was sought which was rejected, however, the same
was allowed by the high Court Karnataka and the
witnesses were directed to be examined by way of audio-
video link. The said judgment is of no help to the
respondents as the same not only pertains to documentary

evidence but also that it has been rendered in a civil case.

As regards the plea of worthy AAG that under
Article 2(e), Article 164 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 and Section 2 of Electronic Transactions

Ordinance, 2002 recording evidence through video
conference is permissible, has no relevance as the same
relates to documentary evidence and not oral.

7. It may also be noted that in India, in the
year, 2009 by an amendment in Criminal Procedure
Code, a proviso was added to subsection (1) of Section

275 of Cr.P.C which reads as follows:-

“Provided that evidence of a witness
under this subsection may also be
recorded by audio, video electronic
means in the presence of the advocate
of person accused of offence”.

From the above amendment in the provision,
taking evidence through video conference is made

permissible in India.

8. What view has been taken by Courts in other
countries or amendments made by them in the law is
irrelevant. This Court has to see whether any amendment
has been made in the Criminal Procedure Code as the
legislature alone has the power to change the procedure
by enacting a law amending it and when the procedure is
changed it would become procedure established by law.

The procedure laid down in the Code at present is a
10

procedure established by law which cannot be modified
or altered by any Court whose job is to interpret the law

and not to make the law.

9. In view of the above, this Court is of the
view that the impugned order dated 09.11.2018 passed by
learned trial Court is contrary to the law and deserves to

be set aside.

10. Consequently, this petition is allowed and
order dated 09.11.2018 passed by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-I, Mardan is set aside.
