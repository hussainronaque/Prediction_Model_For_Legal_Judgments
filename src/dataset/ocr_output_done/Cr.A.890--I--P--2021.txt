JUDGMENT

FAZAL SUBHAN, J.- This criminal appeal is directed against the

judgment dated 09.09.2021 of the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-V, Charsadda, delivered in case FIR No.192 dated 28.07.2016

under sections 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station Battagram, District

Charsadda, whereby appellant has been convicted and sentenced as

under:-

Under section 302 (c) PPC:- To undergo
10 years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay
rupees three lac as compensation to the legal
heirs of deceased in terms of section 544-A
Cr.P.C, recoverable as arrears of land
revenue u/s 544-A(2) Cr.P.C.

Under section 324 PPC:- To undergo 04
years Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a
fine of rupees twenty thousand or in default
thereof to further undergo one month Simple
Imprisonment.
All the sentences were ordered to be run concurrently. Benefit
of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant.
2. Brief facts as per contents of the FIR are that on 28.07.2016
at 0720 hours, complainant Jangraiz Khan son of Meera Khan
resident of Karkan, Charsadda, falling within the jurisdiction of
Police Station Battagram, District Charsadda, while taking the dead
body of deceased Mst. Shamim Ara daughter of Meera Khan and
injured Mir Siyab son of Misal Khan through motorcar, reported to
the local police in Police Station Battagram to the effect that at the
relevant time of occurrence i.e. 0720 hours, they started altercation
with one Almas son of Atlas Khan resident of Karkan when in the
meanwhile Zahoor Khan, Askar Ali sons of Almas Khan and Zahid
Gul son of Zrhawar Khan came duly armed with firearms and
started firing upon them with the intention to cause their death and
as a result his sister Mst. Shamim Ara was hit due the firing of
accused and died on the spot while Mir Siyab was also got injured
whereas he luckily escaped unhurt. Motive behind the occurrence
was stated to be momentary altercation. He, therefore, charged the
above named accused for the murder of his sister and causing
firearm injures to the injured Mir Siyab.
3. After completion of investigation, challan was submitted in

Court. Since the appellant, alongwith co-accused, after commission
of the offence went into hiding and was avoiding his lawful arrest,
therefore, proceedings under Section 512 Cr.P.C. were initiated.
After the arrest of appellant, supplementary challan against him was
submitted. Formal charge was framed against appellant to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution in order to
prove the charge and substantiate the allegations leveled against the
appellant, produced 10 witnesses at the trial and thereafter closed its
evidence. The appellant, at the close of prosecution evidence, was
examined under Section 342 Cr.P.C, who, in his statement, denied
the allegations leveled against him. After hearing arguments, learned
trial Court, vide judgment dated 09.09.2021, impugned herein,
convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Feeling
dissatisfied, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal whereas
Jangraiz Khan complainant-petitioner has filed connected Cr. R
No.174-P/2021, for enhancement of sentence.

4. Since both the appeal and the revision arise out from one and
the same judgment dated 09.09.2021, of the learned trial Court,
therefore, we propose to decide the same through this single
judgment.

5. We have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties

and have gone through the record.
6. We have found that charge against the appellant was framed
u/s 302/324/337-F(ii)/337-A(i)/34 PPC, and at the conclusion of trial
the above referred sentence was passed by convicting the accused
u/s 302(c) to 10 years. In our view, when the trial Court arrived to
the conclusion that prosecution has proved its case beyond doubt,
causing death of Mst. Shamim Ara, then the normal sentence of
death u/s 302 (a) or life imprisonment u/s 302(b) was required to
have been awarded due to the use of word “shall” in section 302
PPC, however appellant was sentenced under section 302 (c) PPC
for 10 years without assigning any reason for awarding lesser
punishment. Section 367(5) Cr.P.C deals with offences punishable
with death, which is reproduced below for convenience:-

“§.367(5). If the accused is convicted of an
offence punishable with death, and the
Court sentences him to any punishment
other than death, the Court shall in its
judgment state the reason why sentence of
death was not passed.”

The said provision on the one hand empowers the trial Court
that in the offence punishable with death the trial Court instead of
awarding punishment of death may award any other sentence upon
the accused but for awarding such lesser punishment, the Court must
give cogent and convincing reason for awarding sentence other than

death. In the case titled Iftikhar alias Istikhar vs. The State and

another, reported as PLD 2004 Peshawar 143 it has been held by

Hon’ble Peshawar High Court that:-

“——-§, 302---Sentence--Offence when
proved has to be met with the maximum
sentence provided therefore--However,
there is no yardstick to restrict or curb
the discretion of the Trial Court while
passing the sentence---Circumstances of
each case would justify the severity or
leniency in passing the legal sentence.”

Similarly, in the case titled Ashiq Hussain and others vs.
The State and 2 others, reported as (2003 SCMR 698) it was held

by the august Supreme Court of Pakistan that:-

-—-Ss.410, 173 & 367---Penal Code (XLV
of 1860), S.302---Constitution of Pakistan
(1973), Art,185(3)---Appeal _—_ against
conviction—-Acquittal by High Court
without assigning cogent reasons--Effect-
-Section 367, Cr.P.C., cast duty upon
Court to note down points for
determination and then record decision—
High Court while acquitting convict had
been influenced by report of Investigating
Officer, who had exonerated him from
charge---Validity-——-Once accused _had
been challaned before Court under S.173,
Cr.P.C, and prosecution had produced
evidence against him, then Court was

bound to decide case in view of material
placed on record and was not supposed to
follow reports of Investigating Officer
being tentative in nature---Such acquittal
was not sustainable in law—-Case was
remanded to High Court for its fresh
decision.

Still in another case titled Syed Hamid Mukhtar Shah vs.

Muhammad Azam and 2 others, reported _as (2005 SCMR 427)

wherein the august Supreme Court of Pakistan while elaborating the

circumstances for awarding normal penalty of death has held that:-
----S.302(b)---Murder---Sentence-—
Circumstances where normal penalty of
death sentence be awarded stated:—-

Insufficiency of motive or motive
being shrouded in mystery could not be
considered as circumstances justifying
non-awarding of the normal penalty of
death to a murderer or to reduce the
sentence of death to a lesser punishment.

Even where the occurrence
resulting in a murder had taken place at
the spur of the moment and even where
only one shot had been fired and same
had not been repeated, the only penalty
deserved by the killer was the normal
punishment of death prescribed for the
said offence.

Inadequacy of weakness of the
alleged motive or where motive had not
been proved, an assailant if found guilty
of causing the murder of another, did not
deserve any leniency and the only
punishment awardable in  such-like
circumstances would be the sentence of
death.

7. We have also noticed that the appellant, in his defence has not
taken any plea of self-defense throughout the trial but the trial Court
in its findings at page 33 of the judgment has concluded that the
appellant has exceeded in exercising his right of defense which
seems to be a conclusion drawn beyond the facts and circumstances
of the case, because there was no plea of self-defence in the case
from the appellant, thus when the question of determination of plea
of self-defence was not raised before the trial Court, the impugned
judgment was not handed down keeping in view the provision of
section 367 Cr.P.C.

8. For the above given reasons, we hold that the judgment

recorded by the trial Court, is not sustainable in the eyes of law and
the same is set aside. The case is remanded back to the trial Court
with the direction to rewrite the judgment in the case in light of the
evidence available on record, within two months from the date of
receipt of record, keeping in mind the provision contained in section
367 Cr.P.C. Till then, the appellant shall remain in custody and to be
treated as under trial prisoner. Office is directed to send the record
forthwith to the trial Court. The connected criminal revision No.174-

P/2021 is dismissed having become infructuous.
