Paindakhel, AAG.

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through
this judgment, we shall also decide criminal
revision No.08-P of 2014 as both the
matters have emanated from same
judgment dated 19.12.2013 of the Additional
Sessions Judge-Xl, Peshawar delivered in
case FIR No.642 dated 24.10.2011
u/ss 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station
Khan Raziq Shaheed, Peshawar, whereby
on conviction, the appellant has been
sentenced to imprisonment for life with fine
of Rs.5,00,000/- within the meaning of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C. payable to the legal
heirs of the deceased or in default whereof
to undergo six months S.I. He was also
convicted u/s 324 PPC and sentenced to

imprisonment for seven years. Both the
sentences were directed to run concurrently
while benefit u/s 382-b Cr.P.C. was
extended to him. The appellant has
impugned his conviction through his appeal
while the complainant, through his criminal
revision, has sought enhancement of the
sentence awarded to the appellant from
imprisonment of life to the normal penalty of
death.

2. Brief facts of the case are that
Muhammad Arshid (PW-9) reported to S.1.
Muhammad Noor (PW-5) at Lady Reading
Hospital, Peshawar to the effect that he and
his cousin lbadullah were on their way to
village Chamkani in Suzuki Carry Van
bearing registration No.SGF-3795.
According to the report (Ex.PA), complainant
Muhammad Arshid was driving the Van
while his cousin lbadullah was on front seat
and when they reached at the place of
occurrence, there, as per FIR, appellant
Muhammad Asif and an unknown person
were present, who opened firing at them
with which they were hit and injured. On the
way to hospital, injured Ibadullah
succumbed to his injuries. Motive for the

crime, as alleged in the FIR, was stated
to be some criminal litigation between the
deceased and appellant.

3. On arrest of the appellant and
completion of investigation, challan was put
in court, which indicted him for the offence to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
Prosecution in order to prove its case
examined 13. witnesses __ whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded,
wherein, he professed his innocence. The
learned trial court, after conclusion of the
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge
and while’ recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above. It is
worth to mention that the unknown person

has not yet been arrested.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Perusal of the case record would

show that in support of his case,
complainant appeared before the court as
PW-9 and deposed in line with what he had
alleged in his report albeit with some
improvement. Noticeable aspect of the case
is that PW-9 is the solitary eyewitness to the
crime, who is also related to the deceased. It
is well settled that when there is only a

solitary eyewitness in the case, who also
happens to be related to the victim, then the
court would appreciate and scrutinize the
case evidence with utmost care and caution,
so as to determine whether the solitary and
related eyewitness has given a true account
of the incident and that his testimony is
corroborated by the surrounding
circumstances of the case. If the deposition
furnished by a solitary eyewitness gets
ample corroboration from the attending
circumstances of the case, then of course
conviction can be based on it, otherwise, no
credence could be attached to the solitary
account of a witness. In the case in hand, no
doubt, the complainant bears the stamp of
injury on his person but it has been held
umpteenth times by the superior courts that
mere stamp of injury on the person of a
witness would not be enough to hold that
whatever he has deposed is nothing but a
truth. Strong corroboration to the evidence
given by a solitary, related and injured
eyewitness is must in order to record
conviction of an accused on the basis of
such evidence.

6. In the context of the above, if we look
at the evidence furnished by _ the

complainant, it would appear that same is
hardly supported by medical and other
circumstantial evidence of the case.
According to murasila (Ex.PA), the
occurrence had taken place at about
18.20 hours on 24.10.2011 when at that
time it was very difficult for the complainant
to properly identify the appellant for want of
light, particularly, when the former was
driving a Van and that too on a busy road of
Peshawar City. The complainant has
deposed that he and the deceased had
offered their evening prayer before leaving
their travel agency situated at Peshawar
Saddar, a place situated at a considerable
distance from the crime spot. Taking into
account the above stated facts of the case, it
can safely be held that there was no chance
for the complainant to properly identify the
appellant as by offering their evening
prayers at Saddar and thereafter reaching at
the spot, there would have been quite a dark
rendering it difficult for the complainant to
properly identify the appellant.

7. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that medical examination of the
deceased has negated the ocular account of
the case. According to the site plan (Ex.PB),

the complainant was driving Suzuki Van and
was moving from West to East and the
deceased was sitting with him on front seat.
As per site plan, the appellant was present
at point No.3, which is towards left side of
the deceased. The medical evidence
furnished by PW-12 shows that the
deceased has sustained five wounds on his
right side. When the appellant was present
on his left side as per site plan and had fired
therefrom, then receiving injuries by the
deceased on his right side would not be
possible. This fact of the case shows that
the occurrence had not taken place in the
mode and manner in which same was
reported and deposed by the complainant.
Though complainant in his cross
examination has stated that the accused,
after firing two shots from his side, turned to
the other side of the vehicle and fired at the
deceased but that statement clearly seems
to be a dishonest improvement with a sole
purpose to bring the medical evidence in line
with the site plan and ocular account of the
case, therefore, no importance could be
given to the above clarification and
explanation.

8. Furthermore, as per Ex.PW13/X-1,

the deceased was brought to the hospital at
18:02:24 hours while according to the case
murasila, the occurrence had taken place at
18:20 hours. Shifting the deceased prior to
lodging the murasila, which was scribed in
the hospital, has created a dent in the
prosecution case as to its accuracy as
presence of the deceased in the hospital at
18.:02:24 hours has negated the allegations
as contained in the initial report.

9. No doubt, the complainant has a
stamp of firearm injury on his person but
that does not mean that whatever he
reported and deposed was a true picture of
the incident, therefore, his testimony cannot
be accepted despite the fact that he has
sustained an injury on his person.

10. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt,
which is hallmark of criminal jurisprudence.
It has been held umpteenth times by the
superior courts that in order to convict an
accused, the prosecution has to prove its
case beyond reasonable doubt and if a
single doubt accrues in the prosecution
case benefit of that will be given to the

accused being a century old principle of law.
It appears to us that the learned trial court
has not appreciated the case evidence in its
true perspective and in line with the settled
principle of criminal law and has fallen in
error by convicting the appellant for which
the impugned judgment is not sustainable.
11. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentence of the appellant are set aside and
he is acquitted of the charges leveled
against him.

12. Above are the reasons of our short
order of even date, which is reproduced as

under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this
appeal is allowed, conviction and sentence
recorded by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-Xl, Peshawar vide impugned judgment
dated 19.12.2013 are set aside. The appellant
is acquitted of the charges leveled against him
and he be set free forthwith, if not required in
any other case”.
