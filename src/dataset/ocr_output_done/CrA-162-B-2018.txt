enhancement of sentence of appellant.

3. As both the appeal and revision petition are
outcome of same F.I.R as well as judgment, are going to be

decided through this common judgment.

4, Succinct facts as divulges from the first
information report Ex:PW 9/1, are that on 07.04.2011, the
complainant Mir Zakam Khan, with dead-body of his son
Shafiqur Rehman, in emergency room of civil hospital, Bannu

reported the matter to the local police, that he alongwith his

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramultah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
son Shafiqur Rehman and his nephew Rais Khan were on the
way towards Sikander Khel and when they reached at the spot
at about 08.45 a.m, accused/respondent Anwar Kamal, duly
armed with 12 bore rifle, already present there, after seeing
them started firing at them, as a result of which Shafiqur
Rehman hit and fell down, while the complainant and his
nephew. Rais Khan luckily escaped unhurt. Accused/
respondent after commission of offence decamped from the
spot. When the complainant attended his son, he was at his last
breath. Motive for the offence alleged by the complainant was
dispute over killing of a drake. The report of the complainant
was reduced in shape of murasila Ex:PW1/1 by Abdul
Hameed Khan S.H.O and sent to the Police Station through
constable Hikmatullah No.1471 for registration of F.IL.R. while
dead-bodies were sent to the Doctor for postmortem
examination under the escort of Abidullah No.302/HC. Syed
Ayaz Khan S.H.O, incorporated the contents of murasila into
F.LR Ex:PW3/1 and sent copy of the same to investigating

office, who after completion of investigation submitted

*Azam/P,S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramuliah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
complete challan before the learned trial Court. On

commencement of trial, accused Shahid was summoned from
Judicial lockup and on his appearance provision of section 265-
C Cr.P.C was complied with and formal charge was framed,
where he pleaded not guilty but claimed trial. On conclusion of
the trial the appellant was convicted and sentenced for the
offence, vide impugned judgment dated 27.09.2017. Hence,

the instant criminal appeal as well as revision petition.

5. We have heard arguments of learned counsels for
the parties and gone through the record with their valuable

assistance.

6. On 07.04.2011, the complainant in the company
of the deceased Shafiqur Rehman (son) and one Rais Khan left
their house for some urgent work for Salema Sikander Khel
Bala, when they reached to the place of occurrence which is
situated in the middle of a graveyard, the accused/ appellant
emerged and on seeing them opened fire, which hit the
deceased on different parts of his body. The complainant with

the help of co-villagers arranged a vehicle and transported the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadultah,
deceased to DHQ hospital Bannu, where he reported the matter
to the local police, which was taken vide murasila Ex:PW1/1.
The complainant was examined as PW-09, where he stated that,
when they reached to the hospital, no police in the reporting
center was present and it was after some time that the local
police attracted to the hospital, where his report was taken
down. The time of occurrence is 08.45 a.m whereas time of
report in DHQ hospital is 09.35 a.m, whereas the distance
between the spot and hospital was given as 7/8 Kilometers, so
there is an abnormal delay in reporting the matter to police.
This is an admitted fact that the deceased succumbed to the
injuries soon after he received the fire shots, but instead of
reporting the matter in the Police Station the dead-body was
taken to the hospital, on one hand to cover the delay, whereas
on the other it indicates that the complainant was not present at
the time when the deceased was done to death. We are
surprised to see that the complainant while recording his
statement before the trial Court explained that he called for the

eyewitness Rais Khan to join them for going to Saleema

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
Sikander Khel Bala, but the complainant throughout his
statement could not explain that what was the purpose behind
to go to the village and that what was the need for calling Rais
Khan to accompany them. Despite the fact that Rais Khan was
the nephew of the complainant but he did not come to record
his statement before the trial Court, and as such was
abandoned as won over, in fact this PW was not present on the
spot at the time of occurrence and so was not ready to depose
against the appellant and when this is the situation then Article
129 (g) of The Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984, will come into play
and negative inference is to be taken against the prosecution.
The complainant is the father of the deceased and PW Rais
Khan was the nephew of the complainant, but their presence at
the place and at the time of occurrence is not established on
record. The complainant was thoroughly cross-examined and
questions were put to him that who brought the cot and who
from the village accompanied the dead-body to the hospital,
but he failed to explain and replied that he did not remember

the names of people who brought the cot and went to the

*AzanyP.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
hospital with the deceased. The complainant stated that he took
the deceased in his lap and his hands and clothes were
besmeared with blood but neither the clothes were handed over
to the police nor his hands were examined by the investigating
officer. The case is one of preliminary investigation, because
this witness clearly stated that on reaching to the hospital the
deceased was first examined and thereafter the report was
taken down. This witness further lost his integrity when the
investigating officer stated that he called the complainant from
the hospital and he reached within five to ten minutes to the
spot, we are surprised that if the said distance could be covered
in five to ten minutes from the hospital, then why it took about
two hours to reach the hospital from the place of occurrence,
which tells nothing but that it was a blind murder and no one

witnessed the occurrence. In case titled, “Gulfam and another

Vs the State” (2017 SCMR 1189), wherein it is held that:

“The prosecution had relied upon two
eye-witnesses, i.e. Muhammad Rafiq
complainant (PW-17) and Muhammad
Ishaq) (PW13) out of whom the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
complainant was a_ brother of
Muhammad Hanif deceased and
Faheem Abbas deceased was an uncle of
the complainant. The said eye-witnesses
lived at some distance from the place of
occurrence and they had claimed that at
the relevant time they were available
near a Dahi Bhalay cart on a roadside.
Availability of the said eye-witnesses on
a roadside near a cart at about midnight
and doing nothing and for no purpose
was a circumstance which was sufficient
to raise many an eyebrow. The said eye-
witnesses were, thus, nothing but chance
witnesses who had failed to establish any
reason for their availability near the

place of occurrence at the relevant time.”

7. The time given by the complainant has further
~ been falsified by the post mortem report when the doctor gave
time between death and postmortem as 2-3 hours, and if the
opinion of the doctor was taken to be correct, then the
deceased died at 07.50 a.m and all this suggest that preliminary
investigation was conducted as initially the dead-body was
taken by the co-villagers and thereafter efforts were made to

procure the attendance of the complainant to report.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice tkramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadultah.
8. The mode and manner of the occurrence is
shrouded in mystery and if the accused/ appellant was to kill
the deceased then why he left the witnesses alive as he had the
ample opportunity to do away with them. The witnesses were
within the firing range of the accused/ appellant that too when
a 12 bore shotgun was used, so the escaping unhurt of the
witnesses does not appeal to mind. The distance between the
deceased and the appellant was given as 18 to 20 paces and
from such a long distance the pellets loose the capacity to
penetrate and kill. The postmortem report clearly mentioned
that one of the entry wound had no exit and no foreign body
was collected during the postmortem examination to
substantiate the claim of the complainant. The investigating
officer recovered one live cartridge and also an empty of 12
bore alongwith blood stained earth from the place of
occurrence, the empty was sent to the FSL for opinion but
onward silence prevailed. It is pertinent to mention that the
police raided the house of the accused wherefrom a 12 bore

rifle bearing No.15217 was recovered and an F.LR was

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramutlah Khan, & Mr, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.
10

registered against his father. The accused was arrested on
10.04.2017 by PW-07 and on his pointation from his house on
13.04.2017, again the same 12 bore gun was taken into
possession and it was sent to the FSL alongwith the empty and
requested the opinion. The FSL report was received in positive,
which has been exhibited and was placed on file, but the
malafide on part of the prosecution is clear from the fact that
initially when the gun was recovered from the house of
accused/ appellant why it was not sent to the FSL as the
investigating officer was well of the knowledge that a 12 bore
gun was used in commission of the offence, so this laxity on
part of the prosecution will definitely favour the accused/

appellant.

9. The medical evidence is in conflict with the
ocular account and the seat of injuries can hardly explain that
these were caused by using a 12 bore shotgun and also the
doctor did not recover the pellets lying inside the body and no

X-ray was made. Keeping in view the dimensions of injuries

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramutlah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
il

given in the postmortem, it hardly persuades that the weapon

used was 12 bore shotgun.

10. The complainant allegedly forwarded a motive i.e.

the shooting of ducks but throughout the investigation nothing

was brought on record either oral or documentary to prove the

motive, but the motive is a double edged weapon which cuts

both ways and this view was consistently held by Hon’ble

Supreme Court, in case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias

acchu Vs the State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“The motive is always a double-edged
weapon. The complainant Sultan Ahmad
(PW9) has admitted murder enmity
between the parties and has also given
details of the same in his statement
recorded before the trial court. No doubt,
previous enmity can be a reason for the
appellant to commit the alleged crime,
but it can equally be a reason for the
complainant side to falsely implicate the
appellant in this case for previous

grouse.”

iI. Though the learned counsel representing the

complainant stressed that the accused/ appellant soon after the

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadutlah.
12

occurrence absconded and to him the abscondence alone is a
sufficient pointer towards guilt of the accused, we are unable
to understand that how in absence of positive and convincing
evidence the abscondence alone can lead to conviction and if
we accede to the submissions so forwarded, we are afraid the
results would be drastic. There is no cavil to the preposition
that abscondence alone cannot be a substitute, for the direct
evidence and this aspect has been beautifully dealt with by the

apex Court in case titled, “Muhammad Sadiq Vs the State”

(22017 SCMR 144), wherein it is held that:

“, The fact that the appellant absconded
and was not traceable for considerably
long period of time could also not be
made sole basis for his conviction when
the other evidence of the prosecution is
doubtful as it is riddled with

contradictions.”

12. Be that as it may, the prosecution failed to
convince this court that it was non-else but accused who killed

the deceased.

*Azam/P.S* (D.B ) MS. Justice Ikramullah Khan, & Mr. Justice Sahibzada Asadullah.

13. After thoroughly evaluating the evidence
available on file this court reaches to an inescapable
conclusion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove
its case against accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is,
therefore, allowed, the conviction and sentence of the appellant
recorded by the learned trial court is set-aside and the appellant
is acquitted of the charge by extending him the benefit of
doubt, He shall be released forth with from jail, if not required
to be detained in connection with any other case. So far as the
connected Criminal Revision No.53-B/2018 is concerned, the

same stands dismissed.

14. These are the detailed reasons for our short order

of the even date.
