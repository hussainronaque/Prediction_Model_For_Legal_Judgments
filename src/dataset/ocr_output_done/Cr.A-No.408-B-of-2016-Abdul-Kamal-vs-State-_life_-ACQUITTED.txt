ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- This appeal is directed

against the judgment dated 10.11.2016, passed by

the Additional Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat,

whereby appellant Abdul Kamal alias Kamal

Khan was convicted and sentenced under section

302 (b) PPC to imprisonment for life for charge of

committing Qatl-e-amd of Rahmanullah with

payment of  Rs.2,00,000/-(two lacs) as
-2-

compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the

legal heirs of deceased and in default thereto to

undergo simple imprisonment for six months.

Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to

the accused/appellant.

2 Precisely, the facts of the prosecution

case, as per FIR, are that on 02.8.2012 at 1815

hours complainant Muhammad Mir brought dead

body of Rehman Ullah (his son) to the Police

Station Tajori and lodged a report to the effect

that he, his son Rehmanullah and nephew Bilal

Khan on 02.8.2012 were going to the house of

Zangi Khan, in order to enquire about his health,

Deceased was going ahead while the complainant

and his nephew followed him. At about 1630

hours when they were crossing the shop of

accused/appellant, on a thoroughfare, accused

Kamal Khan duly armed with Kalashnikov

emerged from his shop and started firing at his

son Rehmanullah with the intention to commit his

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-3-

qatl-e-amd, as a result of which his son was hit

and succumbed to his injuries on the spot. Due to

empty handed the complainant party could do

nothing. The accused after commission of the

offence decamped from the spot. Motive behind

the occurrence was stated that 15 days prior to the

present occurrence, cross firing had taken place

between the accused and the deceased, which was

not reported in police station for the reason that

matter was patched up.

3. After completion of investigation

complete challan under section 512 Cr.P.C against

the accused was put in Court as he was

absconding by then. After arrest of the accused,

prosecution submitted supplementary  challan

against him for trial on 14.6.2014. Accused was

summoned. On his appearance before the trial

Court, provisions of section 265-Cr.P.C were

complied with and thereafter formal charge was

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-4-

framed against him, to which he pleaded not

guilty and claimed trial.

4. Trial commenced and the prosecution

in order to prove its case examined as many as

nine witnesses. After closure of the prosecution

evidence, statement of the accused was recorded

under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he pleaded

innocence, however, he neither wished to produce

evidence in defence nor to be examined on oath

under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. After conclusion of

the trial, the learned trial Court after hearing

arguments of the learned Special Public

Prosecutor, assisted by learned counsel for the

complainant and learned counsel for the accused,

convicted and sentenced him as mentioned above.

5. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment of

the learned trial Court, Abdul Kamal alias Kamal

Khan , the appellant impugned the same through

filing instant Cr. Appeal No.408-B/2016 while the

complainant preferred a criminal revision No.52-

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-5-

B/2016 for enhancement of the sentences awarded

to the accused/convicts. Hence both the appeal

and revision petition are decided through this

common judgment because both the appeal and

revision petition have arisen out of the same

judgment and FIR and the questions of facts and

law in both the cases are identical.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant

argued that impugned judgment of the learned

Trial Court is against the law, facts and evidence

available on record; that the complainant and eye

witness failed to establish their presence on the

spot through some strong physical circumstance;

that there is considerable delay in lodging the FIR

which was made in Police Station Tajori, District

Lakki Marwat, which is at a distance of 5/6 kms

from the place of occurrence; which suggest that

neither the occurrence has taken place in the mode

and manner as advanced by the prosecution and

furthermore the said FIR is a result of consultation

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-6-

and deliberation, after procurement of

complainant and eye witness in the case in hand;

that there was no motive for the accused/appellant

to commit murder of the deceased as_ the

complainant party has clearly stated that the

alleged motive has already been compromised. He

further argued that the medical evidence is in

complete contrast to the story set up in the FIR

and circumstantial evidence does not support the

prosecution version. He lastly argued that the

instant appeal deserve to be allowed and the

accused/appellant be acquitted from the charges

alleged against him.

7. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by

learned counsel for the complainant argued that

appellant is directly charged for effective firing at

the deceased; that ocular account furnished by the

PWs is straightforward and confidence inspiring

which is corroborated by medical evidence, site

plan, recoveries of blood and empties from the

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-7-

spot; that the occurrence has been reported within

two hours after arranging the Datsun; that the FSL

report also corroborates the prosecution case by

elaborating that the firing has been made from one

and the same weapons of 7.62 bore; that the

prosecution has successfully proved the guilt of

the appellant through overwhelming evidence

available on record and sought dismissal of the

appeal of the appellant and also prayed for

enhancement of the conviction.

&. Valuable arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and AAG representing the

State heard and record perused.

9. The occurrence in this case took

place at 04.30 hours while the report was lodged

at Police Station on the same day at 06.15 hours.

It is clear from the FIR that the occurrence has

taken place 5/6 kms away from the Police Station.

Now it is to be seen whether the explanation

offered by the complainant in cross-examination

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-8-

for lodging the complaint, after the delay of 01

hour and 45 minutes, when the police station was

5/6 kilometers away from the place of occurrence

which distance ordinarily could be covered

through vehicle within 10 minutes was

convincing. He in cross-examination with regard

to the above said delay in lodging FIR stated that

just after the death of his son, a cot/charpie was

arranged from the house of Mir Ali, co-villager

whose house was near to the place of occurrence

and deceased was put on it. It is very obvious by

that time he was bleeding. He further stated that

after putting the deceased on the cot, he went in

search of Datsun from the Adda but he did not

find any Datsun, then he proceeded to nearby

village for getting Datsun through bike which was

driven by one Syed Wali. It is not explained as to

how much time he consumed in arranging the

vehicle for taking his son to police station for

lodging a report which admittedly has been

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-9-

lodged at 06.15 p.m. It is unbelievable that on the

availability of so many other persons of his

village, who as per his statement were attracted to

the place of occurrence and gathered around the

deceased, complainant being father, would leave

his son there and go all alone for search of

Datsun. In such a situation a father could not keep

his senses in order and would act, as complainant

offered justification for covering the delay, which

occasioned in lodging the FIR. The complainant,

in order to substantiate his story, which he put

forward for mitigating the effect of delay, caused

in lodging the FIR, did not produce Syed Wali,

who allegedly took him for search of Datsun, as

witness to verify the same and likewise the driver

of Datsun, on which the deceased was taken to

police station for lodging the FIR.The justification

so offered for mitigating the effect of delay,

caused in lodging the FIR, does not appeal to a

prudent mind and additionally, as stated above,

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-10-

was not substantiated by Syed Wali and Driver of

the Datsun, due to the reason of their non-citing

and producing them as prosecution witnesses. As

such, the complainant miserably failed to explain

the justification of delay caused in lodging the

FIR, which was fatal for the prosecution case; as

in the absence of explanation of delay it is

mystery where deceased remained for such a long

time after the commission of the alleged

occurrence, this, proves the manner and mode as

advanced by the prosecution about the alleged

occurrence is not true. The unexplained delay in

lodging the FIR creates serious doubt about the

complainant Muhammad Mir (PW-6) and Hazrat

Bilal (PW-7) as eye witnesses of occurrence. In

such circumstances, it was the bounded duty of

the prosecution to prove the physical presence of

the alleged eye witnesses at the place of

occurrence, for which the prosecution remained

unsuccessful. In this respect reliance can be made

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-ll-

on case titled “Jehad Ali Vs. Riaz Ali and

another” (2014 Cr.L.J 1559).

10. It is also an admitted position that

complainant and the other eye witness namely

Hazrat Bilal are closely related to the deceased did

not go to hospital along with the deceased, for his

post mortem, which in the circumstances, appears

to be unnatural, as the deceased was the only son

of complainant (PW-6). This aspect of the case

has also shaken the story of prosecution for

believing it to be true. The other eye witness

namely Hazrat Bial (PW-7) instead of going to

hospital along with his first cousin has gone to his

house, as he himself has stated in his cross-

examination that when police party came at the

spot, he was called there, from his house. He

further stated that he remained with the

investigation officer from 07.15 p.m to 11.30 p.m;

whereas PW-8 Abdur Rehman SI (1.0) allegedly

visited the spot after chalking out the FIR against

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-12-

the accused/appellant and remained there for 45

minutes. The Statement of PW-7 Hazrat Bilal, the

alleged eye witness of the occurrence, that he

remained with the Investigation Officer for about

04 hours has been belied by the I.O that he (1.0)

remained there on the spot for 45 minutes only. It

has proven that the alleged eye-witness has not

witnessed the alleged recoveries from the place of

occurrence, vice versa, it also belies to the

statement of the investigation officer that he

proceeded to the place of occurrence at 07.15 p.m

and remained there for 45 minutes. So, the

statement of complainant (PW-6) and Hazrat

Bilal (PW-7) as eye witnesses, particularly, in

view of unjustified and unexplained delay, in

lodging the FIR and the contradictions between

the timing of post mortem report and the FIR has

created serious doubt regarding their physical

presence on the place of occurrence. Reliance in

this respect can be placed on case titled

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-13-

“Muhammad Javed Vs. The State” (2016

SCMR 2021).

11. As per the contents of the FIR at

about 1630 hours when the complainant party was

corssing the shop of accused/appellant, on a

thoroughfare, accused Kamal Khan duly armed

with Kalashnikov came out from his shop and

made firing at the deceased, as a result of which

he was hit and died on the spot but the perusal of

post mortem report Ex.PM reveals the probable

time that elapsed between injury and death is 2 to

3 hour and between death and PM is 1 hours,

which clearly suggest that the occurrence has not

taken place in the mode and manner as set up by

the prosecution.

12. It has been observed by this Court

that the occurrence in this case had taken place in

village Abadi on a thoroughfare, surrounded by

houses but only two persons have been cited eye

witnesses i.e. Muhammad Mir (PW-6) and Hazrat

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-14-

Bilal (PW-7) who being closely related to the

deceased, were not only interested but the motive

set up for the commission of the offence by the

accused/appellant also shows that they were

inimical towards him.

13. It is settled law that for giving the

benefit of doubt it is not necessary that there

should be many circumstances creating doubts.

Single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in

a prudent mind about the guilt of accused makes

him entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of grace

and concession but as a matter of right. Reference

is made to case ''Muhammad Akram v. State"

(2009 SCMR 230). The above discussed facts and

circumstances of the case creates serious doubt

regarding the prosecution of proving the guilt of

the appellant beyond the reasonable doubt, as

material facts favouring the appellant, were not

considered by the learned trial Court, while

appraising the evidence of the prosecution. In the

(D.B) Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Abdul Shakoor.
-15-

absence of truthful, trustworthy and reliable and

confidence inspiring evidence, the learned trial

Court has wrongly not extended the benefit of

doubt to the accused/appellant.

14. In view of the above discussion, the

instant criminal appeal is accepted, the impunged

judgment of conviction and sentence dated

10.11.2016, rendered by learned Additional

Sessions Judge-I, Lakki Marwat is set aside and

consequently appellant Abdul Kamal alias Kamal

Khan involved in case FIR No.240 dated

02.8.2012 under sections 302 PPC, Police Station

Tajori, Lakki Marwat is acquitted of the charge

leveled against him. He be set at liberty forthwith,

if not required in any other criminal case.
