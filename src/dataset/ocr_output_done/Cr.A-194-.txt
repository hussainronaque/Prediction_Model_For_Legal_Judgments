2. Appellants had faced trial in case
FIR No. 504 (Ex. PW-6/1) dated 03.10.2018
registered under sections 302, 34 PPC at police
station Wari District Dir Upper on the basis of
‘Murasila’ (Ex. PW-1/1) sent by Gul Fazil Khan
Inspector (PW-9). Complainant namely Wali
Akbar Khan lodged report of the occurrence
while lying on hospital bed of emergency ward of
Wari hospital in injured condition, by stating that

he had left his house on 03.10.2018 at 19:55 hours

for easing himself in the nearby fields (Gala ai) .

where Sarbiland and Sarzamin (appellants herein)

had fired at him with their respective firearms

“ NAWAB . .(D.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
with the intention to commit his murder. As a
result of the firing he had received an injury on
left side of his body cavity below ribcage. It was
also stated in the report that sound of firing had
been heard by his son namely Dil Akbar Khan,
wife Mst. Noorina Bibi and nephew namely
Muhammad Islam who had immediately come to
the spot and had also seen the accused while
decamping from the spot, in the light of a solar
bulb installed nearby. Motive for the occurrence
was stated to have been some land dispute. The
accused/appellants were thus charged for |
commission of the offence. The complainant died .
on 04.10.2018 whereafter section 302 PPC was
also added to the FIR.

3. During the course of investigation,
the Investigating Officer prepared site plan Ex.
PW-5/1 on pointation of the eyewitnesses. Three
crime empties of 7.62 bore were recovered from
the spot vide recovery memo Ex. PW-1/4 dated
04.10.2018. A bulb was also taken in possession
from the spot vide recovery memo dated
04.10.2018 (Ex. PW-1/5). Investigating Officer
also took in possession garments of the deceased

Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-1/6. FSL reports
. Ex. 5/17 and Ex. PW-5/18 in respect of blood
stained garments of the deceased and crime
empties. so recovered from the spot were received
from the Forensic Science Laboratory and placed
on record.

4, On completion of investigation in the

case, complete challan was put in Court against the

appellants. Charge was framed against appellants

on 29.08.2019, to which they pleaded not guilty

and claimed trial. Prosecution was invited to ;
produce evidence, who accordingly examined ten .
(10) witnesses and closed its evidence. Statements °
of the accused were recorded under section 342 °

Cr.P.C. On conclusion of proceedings in trial, ;

accused/appellants were convicted for commission

of the offence vide judgment dated 29.07.2020 of

the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge Dir

Upper at Wari, as stated earlier.

Accused/appellants challenged their

conviction and sentences through the instant

appeal before this Court.

5. We have heard arguments of :

learned counsel for the parties, learned Adil: A.G

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

it
i
appearing on behalf of State and perused the
record,

6. Perusal of record reveals that

prosecution have been relying upon first report of .

the occurrence Ex. PW-1/1 as a dying declaration
as well as ocular account of the incident offered

by the witnesses namely Dil Akbar Khan whose

statement was recorded as PW-1 and Muhammad .

Islam who was examined in Court as PW-2. '

Additionally the prosecutions have also produced

corroboratory evidence in the shape of three

crime empties of 7.62 bore recovered from the

spot and recovery memo of a bulb installed

nearby.

7. Before discussing evidence of
prosecution a reference to the site plan Ex. PW-
5/1 is inescapable in peculiar facts of the instant .
case. The site plan shows western courtyard of ,
the house of deceased as the place where the
deceased had received injuries. Points 2 & 3,
assigned to the accused/appellants has been

shown above the rooftop of the house of deceased
wherefrom they were alleged to have made firing

on the deceased. Three empties of 7.62 bore has,

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’bie Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
been shown recovered from the place of presence
of the accused.

8. Description of the occurrence given
by the complainant/deceased at the time of ,
lodging report has already been given and need .
not be repeated. Witness namely Dil Akbar Khan .
while recording his statement as PW-1 has stated |
in his examination-in-chief that his father had left :
his house for the nearby fields so as to ease
himself. The appellants were alleged to have:
opened fire on him and on hearing the fire shots
he had come out along with his mother Mst.
Noreena Bibi as well as Muhammad Islam
(PW-2) and seen that the two accused had been
making firing upon his father causing injuries on
his person. The appellants were also claimed to
have been seen and identified in light of the bulb
installed nearby. In the start of his cross-
examination he has stated that he had been living
in a separate house but added that at the time of
occurrence he had been present at the house of
his father. He did not deny the suggestion that
while recording his statement under section 161
Cr.P.C he had not disclosed to the Investigating

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Officer that he had been present in the house of ,
his father at the time of occurrence. He also
stated in his cross-examination that the other |
witness namely Muhammad Islam had been ,
nephew as well as son-in-law of the deceased, |
who had been living in village Qonjay (>is) |

and his house had been situated at a distance of !

500 feet from their house. In his cross- |
examination he also stated that his father had,
disclosed to the police that the firing had taken
place from rooftop of their house. But no such
assertion can be found in the FIR. He denied the
suggestion that after recovery of empties from
rooftop he had come to know that firing had’
taken place from the rooftop.

9, The other witness namely,
Muhammad Islam while recording his statement
as PW-2 has also given a similar description of
the occurrence in his examination-in-chief. In his
cross-examination he has stated that the bathroom
had been available in house of the deceased. He
has also stated further ahead in his cross-
examination that height of the rooftop had been

11 feet (approximately). Doctor Roidad Khan

NAWAB (0.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
who was produced in Court as PW-4 had
examined the complainant (deceased) after receipt
of injury, wherein he has stated that his vital organs
damaged resulting into cardiothoracic arrest
haemodynamically instability. Regarding the
certificate of consciousness Ex. PW-4/2 he has

stated in his cross-examination, that same had

been obtained by the police officer concerned |

|

after death of the deceased. In his examination- ,

in-chief he has stated that that the deceased had

been referred to Peshawar and had died at

Batkhela wherefrom his corpse had been brought |

back to the hospital at Wari. It would mean that |
after the corpse was retaken to the hospital, at
that time the certificate of consciousness may

have been obtained from doctor. Further ahead in |
his cross-examination he has stated that the
deceased had been in a serious condition and had |

been leading towards shock. He also stated in his |

cross-examination that the paths of bullet had —

been from downward to upward.
10. The Investigating Officer namely’
' Amin Khan Sub Inspector has been examined as,

PW-5. In his cross-examination he had agreed

NAWAB (0.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
with the suggestion that after recovery of empties
from the rooftop the witness had mentioned in his
statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C that |
the firing had been made from the rooftop. He :
also stated in his cross-examination that from |
photo of the place wherein bulb had been .
installed it was clear that it had been fixed below '
a “Beem” (ex). He also stated that over a “Beem” |
there had been a roof ledge (~>4).

11. From the above stated appraisal of
evidence the following facts can safely be
deduced;

(a) that it had not been mentioned in the first,
report of the occurrence/dying declaration that
firing had been made upon the deceased, from
the rooftop. ,
(b) that the bulb which was claimed to be the
only source of light available on the spot had
been fixed under a “Beem” over which a roof
ledge had also been existing. Over the rooftop no
independent source of light had been indicated
despite the fact that light of the bulb shown in the
site plan could not have lighten the area above
the rooftop, which had been shown as the place

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtlaq [brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-

of presence of the accused and thus there has

been substantial doubt regarding identity of the.

accused/appellants.
(ce) that the claimed eyewitnesses had been
residing separately from the deceased and they

had not been accompanying the deceased at the

time of occurrence, but had been attracted to the

spot after hearing sound of the fire shots.

The first deduction given in point

(a) above is sufficient to discredit the force of |

dying declaration recorded in the case in the
hand. When said fact is also coupled with the
conclusion drawn in point (b) above the

identification of the appellants by complainant at

the time of commission of the offence also

becomes doubtful. The question of identification ,

of the accused/appellants at the time of occurrence
has been lurking on the face of record all along. |
The bulb had been shown by the Investigating
Officer to have been installed in a place whose
light may not have the necessary reflection of:
enlightening the rooftop. Light of the bulb installed
below the rooftop would have definitely got

deflected downwards and it may not have an,

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-ll-

inward effect as a result of which a person standing |
on rooftop might have been identified by the |
complainant or the eyewitnesses at the time of |
occurrence. The bulb has though been recovered .
vide recovery memo Ex. PW-1/5 but it could not be ,
produced during the evidence of prosecution and;
have not been exhibited in their evidence also. The!
occurrence had taken place during night time,’
while no independent source of light could be

shown to have been existing over the rooftop,

therefore identifying the appellants at the place of

occurrence would not have been possible, even if

the complainant or eyewitnesses had the occasion

to locate the directions wherefrom the firing had

been made upon the deceased.

Dying declaration is no doubt
admissible under Article 46 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 and same was the case with
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 where in section 32 of
the said Act dying declaration had been made

' admissible. Evidentiary value of dying declaration
and its exact place in prosecution evidence, is
however a different question which has to be
answered in each case according to its attending
circumstances. It was in the case of dying

NAWAB (0.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahlm
Hon’bie Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-12-

declaration that his Lordship Chief Justice
A.R. Cornelius (as then he was) recorded.
observations that believing or disbelieving dying
declaration was not an exercise in application of;

law rather it was an application of simple human

judgment. Relevant part of his Lordship
observations recorded in the case of “ Abdul Razik'
w/s_The State” reported as PLD 1965 Supreme
Court 151 are reproduced hereunder for ready
reference;

“Now, in the concept of a judicial trial according to
the mode practiced in the British Jurisprudence, belief
or disbelief as to the credibility of a witness is a matter
which is left entirely to the final judgment of a jury. It
is not in any respect a question of law whether a
witness appearing at a trial an deposing as to an
incident should be believed or should not be believed.
The conclusion eventually reached is not an exercise
in the application of law, but merely an application of
simple human judgment. Therefore, it is plain that the
three learned Judges in the High Court were faced
with no legal problem, but merely a question of
ordinary human judgment. The man who made these
statements did not appear before the trial Judge. The
usual aids to belief or disbelief, namely, the
appearance of the face of the witness as he makes a
statement, the manner in which he receives a.
question, considers his reply and states it, the manner
in which he faces cross-examination and meets
objections affecting his veracity, and such other
factors by which the human judgment is assisted, are
all absent. There is only the bare record on paper of
what he said to two persons in the brief time which
elapsed between the firing and his death. Neither of
the persons who recorded his statement was asked
whether he thought the man was saying something
which he had been prepared to say, something which
was artificial, or, on the contrary, judging by his
expression and the way he spoke, that he was telling
the simple truth. Yet, this being the only evidence
available, it is the duty of the Courts to decide whether
or not they can believe it. To accept it without
considering the surrounding circumstances would be

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-13-

totally inconsistent with the safe dispensation of
justice. To accept it on considerations of expressions
of opinion regarding similar declarations in precedent
cases, even if those opinions are accompanied by
words indicating reliance on some principle of law, is
no less dangerous. Only after the most careful
scrutiny, applied to all the physical) circumstances as
they appear from the evidence, is it possible to decide
whether it can be said, with the degree of certainty
which is made obligatory for reaching a conclusion of
guilt, that the’ account given by the deceased of the
manner in which he met his death is worthy of belief.”

Further ahead in said judgment the

physical circumstance mentioned and interpreted

therein, is also very much similar to the facts of -

instant case, and said part of the judgment is
also reproduced hereunder;

“A physical circumstance which required to be

ascertained with accuracy in this case was as to the -

degree of visibility when the shooting took place. The
report of the occurrence was made at the thana in the
same village, Katu Khan at 7-15 a.m., by the deceased

himself. The distance of the spot from the thana is
said to be a mile. According to the evidence, the |

injured man was taken on a cot to the thana and
evidently it must have taken p some time to procure
the cot. In his first dying declaration, Yahya said that
he had already said his morning prayers when h went

to ease himself, and that is possible. The morning pray |
is said at the first crack of dawn, when there is very |
little light, But 7-15 a.m., on the 22nd December 1961, —

which is the day of the winter solstice, that is, when
the night is longest, would be barely after sunrise, and
calculating how much time was necessary for persons
to collect on the spot and to fetch a cot, and probably

also to clean the body of the deceased who had been : '

easing himself when he was fired at (for no one says
that there was any mark of faces on his person or his
clothes) it is necessary to allow an interval of at least
an hour between the occurrence and the arrival at the

thana. The distance of Yahya's house from the spot is .
- two furlongs, and that had to be covered probably four |

times after the occurrence before a start for the thana
could be made. An allowance of an hour is by no
means excessive for all that was necessary, including
the walk to the thana, one mile away. This would put

back the time of the occurrence to about 6 a.m., at

NAWAB (D.B} Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

which time in the dead of the winter, visibility would _
be poor indeed. It follows that the shots must have
been fired from a fairly close distance, and the
accuracy of the shooting confirms this conclusion. It
is plain that the shots were fired from behind the |
deceased. There was a _ pattern of 14 shots
concentrated on the upper right buttock and the
portion of the lower back immediately adjacent. That ;
Shot may have been fired when the man was on his
haunches, but there is also a pattern of 12 pellets on
the back of the left thigh as well as two pellets on the |
adjoining portion of the right thigh, and clearly this °
pattern is the result of a second shot. One or two of
the shots appears to have injured the man's private
parts and it could be that these were included in the '
second pattern. This pattern on the backs of the thighs
could not have been produced unless the man rose
from his haunches, so as to expose the backs of his :
legs. On the upper left back there were two pellet
wounds and one of these pellets appears to have exited
through the front of the chest. These two pellets must :
be attributed to a third pattern of shot. It is difficult to”
include them in either of the patterns previously
mentioned, It may be believed that three shots were |
fired, but it is practically impossible that these shots:
should have been fired, in such low visibility from the
distance indicated by the prosecution which is 86
paces equaling some 215 feet or 72 yards. It was at
that distance that a single cartridge was found, but
that may well have been discarded by the gunman or
gunmen as they walked away from the scene. The;
shots could not have been fired in the half dark at 6
a.m, from a much greater length than say 20 yards
and the closeness of the patterns of shots confirms this,
view.”

After analyzing the evidence in the
manner reproduced. above, benefit of doubt was
extended to the appellant and he was acquitted of
the charges. In the case of “Taj Muhammad and
others _v/s_The State” reported as PLD 1960

WP.) Lahore 723 the benchmarks for
determining veracity of a dying declaration were
stated as follows;

(G) Whether intrinsically its rings true,

NAWAB  -__ (0.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-15-

(ii) | Whether there is no chance of mistake .

on the part of the dying man in
identifying or naming his assailants, and

(iii) Whether it is free from prompting from
. any outside quarter and is not

inconsistent with the other evidence and ,

circumstances.

In the case of “Dr. Munir Ahmad |
ws The State” reported as PLD 1986 Quetta 26 |

criteria for evaluating the genuineness of a dying

declaration was narrated in the following words;

() Whether the maker had the requisite:

capacity to make the dying statement,

(ii) Whether the maker had an opportunity to’

recognize the assailants,

(iii) Whether there were chances for mistake

on the part of dying man in identifying
and naming his assailants,

(iv) Whether it was free from prompting from
any outside quarter, and

(v) Whether the witnesses who heard the
deceased making his statement heard him
correctly and whether their evidence can
be relied on.

Similarly in the case of “Abdur
Rahim v/s The State” reported as 1997 P Cr.LJ
1274, we also find the touchstone for discerning a
dying declaration in the following manner;

(i) there was no chance of mistaken identity,

(ii) the deceased was capable of making
Statement,

(iii) the deceased made the statement without
much length of time after sustaining the
injury,

(iv) _ the statement rings true,

(v) _ the statement was free from promptness
of outsiders, and

NAWAB {D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq torahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-16-

(vi) the deceased was not a man of
questionable character.

One of the common feature, in all the

criterion given above, relates to the fact whether .

the person recording dying declaration had been .

able to identify the accused clearly so as to ward
off any chance of mistake on his part. In the case in |
hand, we have found substantial doubt regarding
identification of the appellants by the complainant, |
because of the fact that the occurrence had taken
place in darkness of the night where in the place |
of appellants no source of light was found
available. Another feature relates to the fact
whether the dying declaration intrinsically rings,
true. We have also suspected the dying
declaration for the reason that it had not been’
mentioned therein that firing had been made upon

the complainant from the rooftop. The medico-

legal report showing path of injuries in the body .

of complainant from downwards to upwards has
also added to our suspicion in this regard. In such
a situation, statement of the deceased

complainant contained in ‘Murasila’, and

NAWAB {D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

‘
6

-17-

presented by the prosecution as dying declaration °

has not been worth reliance.

Presence of the PWs is also

doubtful at the spot of occurrence, as deducted °

from analysis of evidence and mentioned at point

(c) above. Both the eyewitnesses have been living .
separately from the deceased. It has been

mentioned in first report of the occurrence that

the witnesses got attracted to the spot on hearing

sound of fire shots, but it has nowhere been
mentioned there that they had been present in the ,
house of the deceased at the relevant time. It is-
not believable that the witnesses would have

reached the place of occurrence from their;

respective houses and the accused would still

have continued the firing as claimed in their

examination-in-chiefs. The only inmate of the.

house of deceased namely Mst. Noorina Bibi
(his widow) could not be. produced by the
prosecution as a witness and she was abandoned:
Presence of the PWs and seeing the
accused/appellants decamping from the spot are

not believable in circumstances of the case.

12. In light of what has been discussed
above, prosecution have not been able to prove
their case against the appellants beyond reasonable
doubt. They are acquitted of the charges leveled
against them by extending them benefit of doubt, |
and allowing of the instant appeal. Murder '
Reference No. 4-M of 2020 is answered in ,
“negative”. These are reasons for our short order .
of even date wherein it has been provided;
