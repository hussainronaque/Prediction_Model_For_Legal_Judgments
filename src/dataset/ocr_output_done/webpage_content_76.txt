Aqeel
Ahmed Abbasi, J:       Through listed application, filed under Section 561-A Cr.P.C,
the complainant has sought enhancement of surety amount from Rs.1,00,000/- to
Rs.7,00,000/- being the amount of dishonoured cheques.
 
2.         It is contended by the complainant that since there is a
prima-facie case against the respondent/accused, who has taken loan from the
complainant and had issued four cheques for repayment of such loan in the sum
of Rs.7,00,000/-, therefore, the amount of surety should have been equivalent
to the amount of dishonoured cheques.In support of his contention, the
complainant has placed reliance in the case of Abdul Sattar v. The State 2011
Y.L.R 863 (Lahore), Zahid Iqbal v. The State 2011 Y.L.R 1284 (Lahore), Ali
Hakimuddin Ghulam Ali Mandviwala v. The State and another 2009 M.L.D 1189 and
Sikandar Zaman v. The State and others 2011 SCMR 870.
Conversely, learned counsel
for the respondent/accused has vehemently opposed the maintainability of the
instant application filed under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. It is contended by the
learned counsel that in a disposed of matter whereby the bail was granted to
the respondent/accused vide a detailed order dated 19.5.2011, an application
under Section 561-A Cr.P.C is not maintainable as no proceedings are pending
before this Court and the matter is a past and closed transaction. It is
further contended that even in terms of Section 498 Cr.P.C, an application can
be filed by an accused person for reduction of the surety amount, whereas there
is no provision in Cr.P.C whereby an application for enhancement of the surety
could be made. Learned counsel further contended that objection relating to
quantum of the surety has already been dealt in detail by this Court in the
bail granting order dated 19.5.2011, therefore, any modification in this regard
would amount to review of the order, which per learned counsel, is not
permissible under the law. While concluding his arguments he has submitted that
the complainant is bent upon to cause injury to the person and reputation of
the accused, who is a lady doctor by profession and has been the client of the
complainant, who has misused the fiduciary relationship. Per learned counsel, the
complainant is not proceeding with the case pending before the learned trial
Court and has chosen to file instant frivolous application, which is liable to
be dismissed with cost.
Learned A.P.G has submitted
that though fixation of the amount of surety is the discretion of the Court
which may vary from case to case, however, there are cases where the amount of
surety has been fixed equivalent to the amount of dis-honoured cheques.
I have heard the
complainant, learned counsel for the respondent/accused as well as the learned
APG and perused the bail granting order dated 19.5.2011. It may be observed
that whatever has been urged through listed application before this Court has
already been dealt with in paras 13,14 and 15 of the bail granting order. It
appears that through listed application, the complainant has attempted to seek
review of the order, however, could not refer to any provision of law whereby
such request could be entertained in this manner. The complainant has not cited
any case law wherein it has been held that while granting bail in a case, not
falling within the prohibitory clause, the fixation of amount of surety is not
the discretion of the Court, or in case of an offence fallen under Section
489-F, PPC, the surety amount has to be necessarily equivalent to the amount of
the dis-honoured cheque(s). I am of the view that fixation of amount of surety
is the discretion of the Court, which may vary from case to case, whereas its
fixation to an amount equivalent to the amount of dishonoured cheque(s) cannot
be applied as a rule of thumb.
I do not find any substance
in the listed application, which is hereby dismissed.
