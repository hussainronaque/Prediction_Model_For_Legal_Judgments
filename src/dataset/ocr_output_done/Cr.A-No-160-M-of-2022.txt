3. The accused was summoned by
the learned trial Court and charge was framed
against him on 15.04.2022 to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The
prosecution was invited to produce its
evidence, who accordingly examined four (04)
witnesses in support of their case and

accused/appellant was convicted and
sentenced vide the impugned order/judgment

challenged the aforesaid order/judgment by
filing the instant appeal before this Court.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for
the appellant as well as learned Astt: A.G.
appearing on behalf of the State were heard in
considerable detail and the record perused

with their able assistance.

Newb  (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
5. As per the prosecution case the
complainant namely Taseer Khan who
appeared as PW-2 reported the matter that
when he was present on the spot he received
spy information that a pedestrian is smuggling
“ICE” so he and other police officials rushed
to the spot and arrested the appellant who was
having a blue colour polythene bag in his hand
and on search of the bag it containing “ICE”
the same was weighed and it turned out to be
500 grams and thereafter for the purpose of
FSL one gram sample was separated and was
sealed in parcel No. 1 whereas the remaining
“ICE” was sealed in parcel No. 2. The
samples along with the remaining stuff, the
accused and the ‘Murasila’ so drafted on the
spot were sent to the police station through
constable namely Shabir (PW-1) for the
registration of the aforesaid FIR.

6. In this case the prosecution has
been able to produce consistent, trustworthy
and confidence inspiring evidence as PW-1

namely Shabir who is the marginal witness of

Newab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
the recovery memo (Ex.PW-1/1) and PW-2
namely Taseer Khan the seizing officer, have
remained consistent on all the material
particulars regarding the mode and manner of
the recovery effected from the direct
possession of the appellant. Both these PWs
remained consistent regarding the factum of
separation of the samples, preparation of the
recovery memo, drafting of ‘Murasila’ and all
other ancillary and axillary proceedings which
were conducted on the spot. During the course
of cross-examination of these two marginal
witnesses the defence has not been able to
bring on record any inconsistency what to
speak of any material inconsistency. The trend
of cross-examination of these two marginal
witnesses would also show that with the
blessing of defence counsel the case of
prosecution has been confirmed and affirmed.
In a situation akin to the present one in the

case of “Shabbir Hussain v/s The State”

reported as 2021 SCMR_ 198, the Hon’ble

Apex Court has held that we have gone

Nawab  (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad IJaz Khan .
through the statements of PWs and find them
in a comfortable and confident unison on all
the salient aspects of the raid as well as details
collateral therewith. Learned counsel for the
petitioner has not been able to point out any
substantial or major variation or contradiction
in their statements that may possibly justify to
exclude their testimony from consideration.
On the contrary, it sounds straightforward and
confidence inspiring without a_ slightest
tremor. Absence of a witness from the public,
despite possible availability is not a new story;
it is reminiscent of a long drawn apathy
depicting public reluctance to come forward in
assistance of law, exasperating legal
procedures and lack of witness protection
being the prime reasons. Against the above
backdrop, evidence of official witnesses is the
only available option to combat the menace of
drug trafficking with the assistance of
functionaries of the State tasked with the
responsibility; their evidence, if found

confidence inspiring, may implicitly be relied

Newad (S.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad ljaz Khan
upon without a demur unhesitatingly; without
a blemish, they are second to none in status.
Similarly, forensic report is sufficiently
detailed to conclusively establish narcotic
character of the contraband. Similarly, in the
case of “Faheem Ullah ws The State”
reported as 2021 SCMR_ 1795, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that prosecution case is
consistent and straightforward. The petitioner
was apprehended during a routine patrol and
his arrest along with contraband were
incorporated in the daily diary, entry whereof,
is placed on record as Exh.3/A; site plan and
inspection note also coincide with the details,
elaborated in the crime report. These are also
consistent with the investigative details. There
is nothing on the record that could even
obliquely support the plea belatedly taken by
the petitioner and, thus, preponderance of
prosecution evidence comprising safe custody
of contraband, transmission of sample to the
office of chemical examiner with a positive

report supported by a unison account

Nawab (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad {jaz Khan
furnished by the official witnesses remained
unscathed during an inconsequently cross-
examination.

7, In this case the prosecution has
also been able to prove the safe transmission
and safe custody of the sample and contraband.
It is part of the evidence and as stated by PW-2,
the seizing officer that when he separated the
samples and sealed the same into various
parcels, drafted the recovery memo and the
‘Murasila’ then thereafter all of them along
with the accused were handed over to
PW-1 namely Shabir for their transmission to
the police station. The said Shabir when
appeared as PW-1, who too in an unequivocal
terms stated about the factum of taking of
parcels, the accused and the ‘Murasila’ from the
spot to the police station and handing over the
same to PW-4 namely Azmat Ali, who is
Muharir of the police station. Similarly, the
PW-4 namely Azmat Ali in his Court has
categorically stated that he received the parcels,

the case property and the ‘Murasila’ at the

Nawab — (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Jaz Khan
hands of PW Shabir. He has further stated that
on the next day he also handed over parcel
No. 1 along with the receipt Rahadari to PW
Shabir for taking the same to the FSL. The
FSL report (Ex. PW-3/9) shows that the
samples were brought by the said PW Shabir.
So, in this view of the matter, the prosecution
has established the safe transmission and safe
custody of the parcels and contraband from
the spot to the police station and from the
police station to the FSL. In the case of
“Faisal Shahzad v/s The State” reported as
2022 SCMR 905, the Hon’ble Apex Court has
held that learned High Court after perusal of
evidence has rightly found that on the same
day when the narcotic was recovered from the
petitioner i.e. 27.02.2012, 10 sealed sample
parcels of contraband Charas and five sealed
sample parcels of opium were received by
Falak Sher, HC (PW-1) for safe custody. The
said PW handed over the said samples to
Mumtaz Hussain (PW-2) on 02.03.2012 along

with road certificate for their onward

Nawed (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad jaz Khan
-10-

transmission to the office of Chemical
Examiner Multan. This fact was confirmed
and testified by the said Mumtaz Hussain,
who took the samples to the office of
Chemical Examiner on the same day. The
reports of the Chemical Examiner also testify
this fact, therefore, it can safely be said that
the safe chain of custody of the recovered
narcotics was not compromised at all.
Similarly, in the case of “Liagat Ali &
another v/s The State” reported as 2022

SCMR_1097, the Hon’ble Apex Court has

reiterated the same rational by holding that
even otherwise, on merits we could not find
anything from the record, which could suggest
that the safe chain of custody of the narcotic
was compromised. The close analysis of the
whole prosecution evidence i.e. the recovery
of huge quantity of narcotics, the happening of
the occurrence in broad daylight, report of the
Chemical Examiner and the statements of the
prosecution witnesses when evaluated

conjointly, there is no other option left with

Newb (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-ll-

the Court except to rely on the statements of
the prosecution witnesses for the purpose of
conviction as recorded by the two courts
below.

In view of the above, the
prosecution has successfully established the
safe transmission and safe custody of the
contraband which was recovered from the
direct possession of the appellant.

8. The FSL report (Ex. PW-3/9)
available on file which has been established
through unbroken chain by the prosecution
speaks that the contraband recovered from the
appellant was found to be methamphetamine
(“ICE”) and the overleaf of the FSL report
also shows that protocol as required was fully
applied while analyzing the sample, therefore,
no lacuna whatsoever in the FSL report has
been brought on record.

9. During the course of arguments
and hearing of this appeal the learned
counsel for the appellant was confronted that

in the cross-examinations of the marginal

Nawab  (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-12-

witness PW-1 and PW-2 namely Shabir
and Taseer Khan respectively, the charge of
recovery of contraband from the appellant has
been confirmed and affirmed instead of
shattering the same as all the answers to the
questions which were put to them are
confirming the prosecution story with the
blessing of the learned counsel for the defence
and as such nothing has been brought from
these prosecution witnesses either to challenge
their presence on the spot or to shatter their
testimony/evidence. Learned counsel for the
appellant though stated that in the statement of
PW-1 there is reference to the date of
occurrence as 26.11.2021 instead of 25.11.2021,
however, such an omission is not so
significant to destroy the whole case of
prosecution in its totality. In the case of
“Khadim Hussain v/s The State” reported as
PLD 2010 Supreme Court 669, the Hon’ble
Apex Court has held that various
contradictions in the statements of the

prosecution witnesses have not been taken

Nawab  (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad az Khan
-2B-

into consideration causing serious prejudice
against the appellant. It has been held time and
again by this Court that minor contradictions
do creep in with the passage of time and it can
be ignored safely. Similarly, in the case of
“Muhammad Ilyas v/s The State” reported as
£2011 _ SCMR_460” the Hon’ble Supreme
Court had also held that contradictions which
are not grave in nature can be ignored safely
as minor contradictions creep in with passage
of time. Merely on the basis of contradictions,
statement of a prosecution witness cannot be
discarded if corroborated by other incriminating
material.

10. The record and evidence
available on file also shows that the appellant
has not controverted during the cross-
examinations of prosecution witnesses that
either the seizing officer namely Taseer Khan
(PW-2) or any other PWs have got any il/-will
or grudges or motive for the false implication
of the appellant and it was not even remotely

suggested to the appellant during the course

Nawab  (S.B) _Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-14-

of trial, therefore, the consistent, trustworthy
and confidence inspiring evidence of these
PWs is absolutely free from any kind of
manipulation.

11. As a last attempt to create a dent
in the prosecution case the plea of learned
counsel for the appellant was that no private
persons were associated with the recovery
proceedings but this plea of the appellant is
also misconceive as when the special law by
itself specifically excludes the applicability of
section 103 Cr.P.C from the recovery
proceedings conducted under The Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotic Substances
Act, 2019, then such objection of the appellant

could not be legally appreciated in his favour.

12. In this view of the discussion the
prosecution has successfully established the
safe custody of contraband as well as safe
transmission of the parcels from the spot to
the police station and from the police station

to the FSL and thus the result so obtained of

Newap (S.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad ijaz Khan
off Pig

or

-15-

the FSL shows that the contraband
recovered from the appellant were “ICE”
(methamphetamine), Even otherwise, we
scanned the record of the case as well as the
evidence produced by the prosecution with
the able assistance of learned counsel for the
appellant as well as the learned Astt: A.G and
found that all the PWs are consistent, coherent
and in line with the prosecution case and as
such their evidence could not be disbelieved

on any score whatsoever.

13. In light of what has been
discussed above, it is held that the learned
trial Court has rightly convicted the appellant
after finding him guilty for commission of the
offence by recording valid reasons in the
impugned judgment and as such the appeal in
hand filed by the appellant against his
conviction is found devoid of any force and
the same is accordingly dismissed.
