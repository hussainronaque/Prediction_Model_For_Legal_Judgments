emanating from the judgments of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court, Hangu
dated 29.10.2019 in case FIR No.198 dated 22.04.2006
under section 302/324/427/148/149 PPC of Police Station
Hangu as in all the above noted cases, an important
common legal question raised by the counsels for
appellants which warranting an appropriate order by this

court:-

“Whether evidence of prosecution witness(s) in
criminal trial(s) can be recorded by the Court through
a video call, viber, Skype, IMO, WhatsApp,
Facebook Messenger, Line Caller and Video

Conference including such other modern devices and
applications; if yes, whether such statement(s) would
be legal under the law on the face of section 353 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, which is
couched in a language that except as otherwise
expressly provided, all evidence taken under Chapters
XX, XXI, XXII and XXII-A) shall be taken in
presence of the accused, or, when his personal
attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his
pleader. And finally what would be the admissibility
of such evidence under the provisions of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984, particularly its Article 164 ?

2. During arguments in the case in hand, the above
formulated question raised in the matrix of the following

facts:-

According to FIR, on 21.06.2007, complainant
Juma Said, in company of dead body of his brother,
namely; Abdullah deceased, reported in Police Station
Zaida to the effect that on the eventful day he along with
his brothers, Abdullah, Bahadar and son Saeedullah, after
finishing their Tandoor work in Marguz Bazzar, was on
the way to home and when reached near the house of one
Nizar, accused Muhammad Israr, duly armed with firearm,
emerged there and opened fire at the deceased, as a result,

he got hit and died at the spot. Besides him, the occurrence
is stated to have been witnessed by PW Bahadar Jamil and
his son Saeedullah. A dispute over the cooking of bread
between the deceased and the accused/appellant has been

advanced as motive behind the crime.

After completion of investigation, initially challan
under section 512 Cr.P.C was submitted against the
appellant before the learned trial court, where he was
declared as proclaimed offender vide order dated
10.03.2008. On 09.06.2016, the appellant was arrested; as
such supplementary challan was submitted against him
before the learned trial court, where he was formally
charge sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial, hence, evidence of the prosecution was invited. Since,
PW Saeed Ullah was in Saudi Arabia in connection with
earning his livelihood, hence, on 09.07.2019, his statement
was recorded by the learned trial court as PW.9 via video
call on IMO. In cross-examination, the said PW while
replying to a question stated that he is present in his
residential room at Saudi Arabia when his statement is
being recorded. Similarly, in connected cases, statement of
Faisal Khan complainant, an eyewitness has been recorded

as (PW.6) through video call from Dubai.
3. The case was earlier fixed for 05.11.2019, wherein
during arguments, learned counsel for the appellant-
convict, at the very outset, raised a challenge mainly on the
ground that recording evidence on any kind of video
device from a foreign State, when a witness admitting the
factum of his presence in his personal residential room,
would not meet the requirement of section 353 Cr.P.C.,
according to which all evidence shall be taken in presence
of the accused or when his personal attendance is
dispensed with, in presence of his pleader. He argued that
physical presence of a witness at the time of recording
evidence is necessary before the court for the purpose of
ensuring decorum of the court and to avoid any untoward
situation. He further contended that in case of recording
evidence through video call, if a witness intentionally
offends or interrupt proceedings before a Public Servant
sitting in the judicial proceedings, his action cannot be
controlled by the presiding officer of the court and this
shall not only violate the sanctity, decorum and prestige of
a court, but the disobedient and disdainful witness would
also be beyond the punitive provisions of the law. He
pointed out that apart from above, there may be every
possibility of such witness being coached or tutored while

giving evidence, and in that case, the witness will not be
under the control of the Court. He emphasized that the
advantage of the proceedings having been conducted in
open court as required under section 352 PPC,in an
evidence recorded through mobile device or video link, as
the public would have no access to attend the proceedings

like they could have in open Court.

4. When the learned AAG for the State and learned
counsel for the complainant were confronted with the
submissions of learned counsel for the appellant, they
requested for time to meet the arguments addressed by
learned counsel for the appellant. Their request was
acceded to, hence, the case was posted to 07.11.2019. On
the said date, learned counsel for the
respondent/complainant requested for further time to assist
the court. Mr. Gohar Ali Advocate, present in the court
was also appointed as Amicus Curie to assist the court with

research based studies on the issue.

5. Today arguments of learned counsel for the parties
along with Mr. Ali Gohar Durrani, Advocate, amicus curae
heard and research work on the point perused which
reflects that except Pakistan and Australia, in all the
developed countries of the world no endeavor is made to

provide a specific provision for recording evidence via
video link or modern electronic devices. The International
Law provides certain provisions, according to which a
witness not able to appear before the court, is allowed to
record his statement through video link. Instance of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) may be quoted here,
which allows a witness, who is absent from the courtroom,
to record testimony through video link subject to
submission of application with reason of inability to
personally appear before the court and the rules and
regulations are to be followed. Article 69(2) of Rome
Statute, Rule 65 of the ICCs Rules of Procedure and
Evidence, Rule 61 of ICCs, Regulation of the Office of
Prosecutor and Regulation 45, 46 and 47 of the ICCs, are
statutory provisions regulating the procedure and
arrangement for allowing and recording evidence via video

or audio link.

In April 1997, the Prosecution brought a Motion
(application) before the Trial Chamber of International
Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia in case titled,
“Prosecutor Vs Zejnil Delalic” for allowing the recording
of certain prosecution witnesses by means of video link.

The Tribunal after scanning all the ICCs Laws regulating
the provision of allowing appearance and examination of

witnesses through video link, observed that:-

“Video-conferencing is, in actual fact, merely an
extension of the Trial Chamber to the location of
the witness. The accused is therefore neither
denied his right to confront the witness nor does
he lose materially from the fact of the physical
absence of the witness. It cannot, therefore, be
said with any justification that testimony given
by video link conferencing is a violation of the
right of the accused to confront the witness.

Article 21(4)(e) is in no sense violated.”

The Trial Chamber of ICC in the above titled case relied
upon the earlier decision on the subject matter rendered in
Tradic case, wherein law was set forth to the effect that the
evidentiary value of the testimony provided by video link
would be practicable and reliable subject to fulfillment of
the required guideline enumerated in Para No.22 of the

decision:-

“The Trial Chamber acknowledges the need to
provide for guidelines to be followed in order to
ensure the orderly conducted of the proceedings
when testimony is given by video link. First, the
party making the application for video link

testimony should make arrangements for an
appropriate location from which to conduct the
proceedings. The venue must be conducive to the
given of truthful and _ open _ testimony.
Furthermore, the safety and solemnity of the
proceedings at the location must be guaranteed.
The non-moving party and the Registry must be
informed at the every stage of the efforts of the
moving party and they must be in agreement with
the proposed location. Where no agreement is
reached on an appropriate location, the Chamber
shall hear the parties and the Registry and make a

final decision”.

6. The Courts, in various foreign jurisdictions, have
employed the use of technology for the purpose of
recording of evidence. The United State of America (US)
allows the video conferencing and its Federal Court of
Claims have provided guidelines for the use of video

conferencing.

Similarly, the Supreme Court of Florida, while
dilating upon the issue of recording evidence by means of
video conferencing, in case titled, “David Harrell Vs

State_of Florida” (Fla. 1998) made the following

observations:-
10

“We also acknowledge that possible audio and
visual problems can develop’ with _ satellite
transmission. It is incumbent upon the trial judge to
monitor such problems and to halt the procedure if
these problems threaten the reliability of the cross-
examination or the observation of the witness’s

demeanor.

Our court is mindful of the importance of
today’s decision. Yet, we are also mindful that our
society and indeed the world, is in the midst of the
information Age. Computers are the norm in
American households and business; an_ infinite
amount of information is available at our finger tips
through the internet and satellite technology allows
us to travel the world without ever leaving our living

rooms.

The legal profession has also benefitted from
hese technological innovations. Legal research that
once took hours or days is now available in seconds
hrough computer and internet databases. Clients can

reach their attorneys anywhere in the world through

he use of cellular and video innovation. The list

goes on and on.

Indeed, our very own court takes pride in the
recent technological advancements that have been

made. Oral arguments before the court are broadcast
11

live via satellite throughout the state. These same
arguments can be viewed online, along with the
parties briefs. The Florida Supreme Court Website
has received world wide acclaim for opening up the
court house doors to the general public. All of these
steps provide greater access to the judicial system,

which in turn increases public trust and awareness.

That being said, it becomes quite clear that
courtrooms of this state cannot sit idly by, in a
cocoon of yesteryear, while society and technology
race towards the next millennium. Fortunately, the
courtrooms of this state have not been idle nor are
they speeding at a reckless pace. Recent changes in
the courtroom have included the use of audiotape
stenographers as well as video transmission of first
appearance, arraignments, and appellate oral

arguments, just to name a few.

We recognize that there are generally costs
associated with change. Nevertheless, technological
changes in the courtroom cannot come at the
expense of the basic individual rights and freedoms
secured by our constitutions. We are confident that
the procedure approved today, when properly
administered, will advance both the access to and the
efficiency of the justice system, without
compromising the expectation of the safeguards that

are secured to criminal defendants.”

In Minnesota Court of appeals (US) in a case titled,
“State vs Sewell, the appellant, namely, Jaffery Edward
Sewell challenged his conviction for second degree felony
murder on the grounds that the trial court’s allowance of
testimony through Interactive Television (ITV) impaired
his constitutional right of confrontation and prosecutorial
misconduct during final arguments deprived him of a fair
trial. The appeal was heard and finally the Court
concluded that the testimony of a witness recorded
through ITV did not violate the Confrontation Clause
Rights under the sixth Amendment to the United States
Constitution or Article 1, section 6 of the Minnesota
Constitution when the use of ITV was an extension of
Minn.R.Crim P.21 The statements made by the
prosecutor, during closing argument, did not prejudice
appellant or deny him a fair-trial. The use of video
link/skype/video conference in Court proceedings and for
recording of evidence of witnesses is in practice all over
the world. In the United States of America in case titled,
“Maryland Vs Craig (497 U.S. 836(1990) which is a
leading case on the subject, the Supreme Court of United
States has held that recording of evidence by video
conferencing did not offend the Sixth Amendment

(Confrontation Clause) and accepted child witness
13

testimony via a one-way video. In case titled, “David
Harrell _Vs_ State of Florida” (709 So.2" 1364
(Fla.1998), the Florida Supreme Court sustained a
robbery conviction based on largely on the two-way video
testimony of complainants testifying from Argentina. In
United States Vs Gigante (166 F.3" 75, 84 (2"
Cir.1999), the U.S. Court of appeals concluded that
video-conferencing did not violate the U.S. confrontation
clause. This case involved the testimony of a witness
procured through video conferencing technology because
the witness was too ill to testify at trial. The Court decided
that two-way video technology adequately met the central
concerns of the Constitution because the witness was
swom; he was subjected to full cross-examination; he
testified in full view of the jury, Court, and defence
counsel, and gave his testimony under the eye of Gigante-
the defendant himself. In Ireland, section 13 of the
Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 enacts that any person other
than the accused whether he be within or outside the State
can give evidence through television link. Such evidence
is also required to be video recorded. Similarly, in
Australia, section 47-C to 47-E of the Federal Court of
Australia Act, 1976, deal with recording of evidence

through video/audio links or other appropriate means.
14

New South Wales has enacted Evidence (Audio and
Visual Links) Act, 1998 No.105 (NSW) to facilitate the
taking of evidence, and the making of submissions, by
audio links and audio video links. In the United Kingdom,
the Access to Justice Act, 1999, allow video conferencing
to be used for civil hearing. On the other hand, section 51
of the Criminal Justice Act, 2003, enables the Court to
allow witnesses (other than the defendant) in the United
Kingdom to give evidence by live link if the court is
satisfied that giving evidence in this way is in the interest
of efficient or effective administration of justice.
Moreover, under Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence
Act, 1999, evidence of vulnerable, intimidated or other
witnesses can be recorded through video links. In Canada,
rule 1.08(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure permits trial
evidence by telephone or video-Oconference then it is
open to the Court on motion or on its own initiative to
make an order directing a video-conference on such terms
as are just. In South Africa, Section 158(2) of the
Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act No.51 of 1977), as
amended by the Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures)
Amendment Act, 2010, specifies the instances in which a
court may allow evidence to be taken through close-

circuit television or similar electronic medium.
15

7. In yet another instance, the Federal Court of
Australia also allows recording of evidence through video-
conferencing, either in case of absence or protection of
witnesses. The Federal Court Act, 1976 of Australia has
left the recording of evidence through digital video link at
the discretion of the court. According to the Act ibid, any
proposal for recording evidence shall be decided by the
court, after hearing parties to the proceedings. It further
provides that the law for enabling a person to place
proposal before the Court for recording testimony via
video sources or the court or judge may allow evidence on
own initiative keeping in view the benefits of use of video
links. Likewise the Federal Court Rules 2011 have been
framed which provide elaborate guidelines for video
conferencing in the court proceedings. Besides,
complementary legislation has been enacted in Australia
and New Zealand which enable both the courts in each
country to take evidence via video conferencing from a
witness in the other country. In addition, the Hague
Convention of March 18, 1970 on the taking of evidence
abroad, in civil or criminal matters provides for a frame
work may be used to facilitate the taking of evidence via

video conferencing in countries that have acceded to that
16

convention, subject to certain prohibitions or restrictions

existing in the acceding countries.

On 14" September, 2005, the Attorney General
Australia tabled a Bill for amendment in the Crime Act
1914 to create new video link evidence provision
applicable to the proceedings for terrorism and other
related offence and proceeds of crime proceedings relating
to those offences. The Bill received Royal assent and it
was enacted under the name and style of “Law and Justice
Legislation Amendment (Video Link evidence and other
Measures) Bill 2005, which allowed evidence by using
video link from overseas witnesses who are unable to
travel to Australia to be put before the court using video
link technology. For monitoring the conduct and demeanor
of the witness, the presence of an Australian observer at
the witness end was held to be necessary. The Bill also
amended the foreign Evidence Act, 1994 to reflect in
corresponding terms that admissibility of foreign evidence,
such as video tapes and transcript for terrorism offences,
where video link itself is not possible, again changing the
onus on the defendant to prove a substantive adverse effect
on the right to fair hearing. In essence, the Australian State

generally provides for the witness to record evidence on
17

video link in order to reduce movement to the court and
even to the access to minimize the threat or danger to life

in terrorism cases.

8. In the Indian legal system, evidence is collected
under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, whereas in criminal
cases the Criminal Procedure Code specifies the procedure
of collecting and recording evidence, so much so the court
has the power to compel a person to appear before it for
giving evidence. Indian statute does not have specific
provision for recording evidence via video link, however,
through judicial pronouncements, the amendment made in
Evidence Act by insertion of sections 65-A and 65- a
special provision as to admissibility of Electronic
Recording was introduced and stretched, rather broadly
interpreted that the frame work and parameter for the use
or admissibility of Electronic evidence also include the
evidence recorded through video conferencing. Initially,
question recording evidence through video facility befell
before the court of Magistrate as a trial Court at Mumbai
India, in a complaint case registered against Dr. Praful B.
Desai by Mr. PC Singh. During trial, the prosecution
submitted an application for examining of Dr.Greenberg

(settled in USA) through video link, which was accepted
18

by the trial court. The respondent challenged that order
before High Court which was allowed and by setting aside
the order of trial court, the application for examining the
witness through video link was rejected. The complainant,
as well the State approached the Supreme Court of India
through Special Leave Petition (Criminal (SP). The
Supreme Court on scanning the Criminal Procedural law,
Evidence Act and judgments of various courts allowed the
application for recording testimony of witness via video
link vide judgment dated 01.04.2003, reported as “the
State of Maharastra Vs Dr. Draful B. Desie” (AIR 2003
SC 2053). On disposal of the appeal the Supreme Court
set-aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and the
trial Court/Magistrate was allowed to have the evidence of

Dr. Green berg recorded by way of video conference.

9. In Pakistan, Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984 (“the Order 1984”) deals with the production
of evidence that has become available because of modern
devices, etc, and by adding/inserting proviso to the said
Article, conviction on the basis of modern devices or
techniques may be lawful. For the sake of convenience and
ready reference, Article 164 of the Order, 1984 (ibid) is

reproduced below:-
19

“164. Production of evidence that has become
available because of modern devices, etc. In
such cases as the Court may consider appropriate,
the Court may allow to be produced any evidence
that may have become available because of

modern devices or techniques.

Provided that conviction on the basis of

modern devices or techniques may be lawful”.

The word “evidence” provided in the above quoted Article
is defined in Article 2(1) (c) of the Order, 1984, which

includes:-

i. All statements which the Court permits or
requires to be made before it by witnesses, in
relation to matters of fact under inquiry, such

statements are called oral evidence; and

ii. All documents produced for the inspection of
the Court, such documents are called

documentary evidence.

Similarly, under Article 2 (b ) of the Order, 1984,
“document” means any matter expressed or described
upon any substance by means of letters, figures or marks,
or by more than one of those means, intended to be used,
or which may be used, for the purpose of record that

matter.
20

Illustrations
A writing a document;

Words printed,__lithographed or photographed are

A map or plan is a document;
An inscription on a metal plate or stone is a document;

A caricature is a document.

Article 2(1)(c ) of the Order, 1984 speaks about the
“evidence” but it is interesting to note that the Legislature
has not defined meaning of the evidence rather has
mentioned that evidence “includes” a statement that the
court “permits or requires” to be made and/or all
documents produced. It is settled principle of law that the
word “include” is always used in “interpretation clause”
in order to enlarge the meaning of the word and phrase
occurring in the body of a statute. Similarly, the words
“etc” inserted in Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order, 1984, also enlarge the meaning of the Statute to the
extent of the modern device which will include all modern
scientific devices of the present age. Reading of the above
quoted provision of the Qanun-e-Shahadat article well
make it abundantly clear that production of evidence
through modern devices has been left to the discretion of

the trial court. Such evidence may only be allowed if the
21

court considers it appropriate. Article 130 of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 though aims to regulate procedure
for production and examination of witness in court, but in
absence of any such provision in Criminal or Civil
Procedure Code, the court shall exercise its discretion and
may adopt any appropriate procedure for recording of

evidence.

10. | Chapter-XXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898 “the Code” particularly, section 353 thereof, lay
down a mechanism of taking and recording of evidence in
the inquires and trials in criminal case, however, it does
not provide specifically for taking of evidence through
video conferencing, but at the same time, there is no
provision in the Code which prohibit taking and recording
of evidence in this manner. For the sake of convenience
and ready reference, section 353 of the Code is

reproduced below:-

“353. Evidence to be taken in presence of
accused: Except as otherwise expressly
provided, all evidence taken under Chapters
XX, XXI, XXII and XXII-A) shall be taken in
presence of the accused, or, when his personal
attendance is dispensed with, in presence of

his pleader.”
22

11. The procedural law of the country is silent about
examination of witness under Criminal or Civil Procedure
Code via video link, however, it cannot be controverted or
denied that the Criminal Procedure Code is ongoing status
and renowned jurist “Frencis Bennion” has set out the
principal of interpretation on such like statute in his
commentative titled “Statutary interpretation” 2"! Edition

Page 617, which is reproduced below:-

“Tt is presumed the parliament intend the court
to apply to an ongoing act, a construction that
continuously updates it, wording to allow for
changes since the Act was initially framed,
while it remains law, it has to be treated as
always speaking. This means that in its
application on any day, the language of the set
thought necessarily embedded in its own time,
is nevertheless to be constructed in accordance

with the need to treat it as a current law”

From the above quoted golden principle of interpretation
of statute, it is manifest that the law cannot be left
standstill, rather it shall continue to respond to the needs of
socially changed situation. In other words, the law must be
constantly on the move, adopting itself to the fast changing

society and not lag behind. The provision of article 164 of
23

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, allow the evidence
collected through modern devices, wherefrom inference
can be drawn that by development of technology and
digitalization of courts throughout the world, the courts are
needed to set out the broad approach for delivering fair and
expeditious justice to the needies. The matter came before
the Division Bench of the Honorable Karachi High Court
in case titled, “Shaikh Aijazur Rehman Vs the State

(NAB) through Director-General (NAB) and another
(PLD 2006 Karachi 629), wherein it was held that the

Code is an ongoing statute and while approving Bennion’s
exposition, the Honorable Court ruled that it shall be
interpreted in a dynamic way so that it may serve the needs
of the society. The worthy High Court observed that
section 353 of the Code which prescribes that all evidence
must be taken in the presence of the accused (or when his
personal attendance is dispensed with, in presence of his
pleader) should be given a progressive meaning. The terms
“presence” used in the said section should be interpreted
to include constructive presence to allow recording of

evidence through video conference. Similarly, in case

“Muhammad_Hanif_and_others Vs_Karachi_Electric
Supply Company Limited and another (2013 CLC _ 571),

the learned single Bench of the same High Court while
24

construing section 20(1)(c ) of the Electricity Act, 1910,
accepted that “interpretation of statutes”, especially those
dealing with technical matters, should be that they are
“always speaking”. Their meaning should be adopted and
developed (if possible) to take into account subsequent

developments.

12. The Supreme Court of India has also approved the
aforementioned principle of updating construction and has
applied the same in a number of cases. In case titled,
“State (through CBI/New Dehli) vs S.J. Choudhary”
(1996 AIR SCW _ 1128) while holding that the Evidence
Act, 1872, is ongoing statute, the court ruled that the word
“handwriting” in section 45 of the Act (ibid), would
include “typewriting”. Similarly, in case titled, “SIZ
Import USA Vs Exim Aides Silk Exporters” (AIR 1999
SC_1609), the Supreme Court of India has further held

that;

“The word “notice in writing” in section 138 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act, were to be
construed to include a “notice by fax”. Applying
the same principle, the Supreme Court of India
has construed over a period of time various
terms and phrases. For instance, it has

interpreted “stage carriage” to include “electric
25

tramcar” “steam tricycle” to include
“locomotive”, “telegraph” to include “telephone”,
“bankers book” to include “microfilm”, “to take
note” to include “use of tape recorder”,
“documents” to include “computer databases”. In
case titled, “Aubrey Vs_the Queen (2017) HCA
18”, the High Court of Australia applied the
“always speaking” approach in interpretation of
section 25(1)(b) of the Crime Act, 1900 (NSW).
As a consequence, it held that a person having
sexual intercourse with another causing him/her
to contract a grievous bodily disease could
amount to infliction of grievous bodily harm. It
further held that “the approach in this country
allows that, if things not known or understood at
the time an Act came into force fall, on a fair
construction, within its words, those thing should

be held included”.

The Supreme Court of India in case titled, “National

Textile Workders’ Union Vs P.R. Ramakrishnan (1983)

1 SCC 228, at page No.256 has observed that:-

“We cannot allow the dead hand of the past to
stifle the growth of the living present. Law cannot
stand still; it must change with the changing social
concepts and values. If the bark that protects the

tree fails to grow and expand along with the tree, it
26

will either choke the tree or if it is a living tree, it
will shed that bark and grow a new living bark for
itself. Similarly, if the law fails to respond to the
needs of changing society, then either it will stifle
the growth of the society and choke its progress or
if the society is vigorous enough, it will case away
the law which stands in the way of it growth. Law
must therefore constantly be on the move adapting
itself to the fast changing society and not lag

behind”.

In another case titled, “Sri Krishan Gobe Vs State of

Maharashtra (1973) 4 SCC _ 23), while emphasizing

production of all available evidence, it observed as under:-

“Courts must endeavour to find the truth. It has
been held that there would be failure of justice not
only by an unjust conviction but also by acquittal
of the guilty for unjustified failure to produce
available evidence. Of course the rights of the

accused have to be kept in mind and safeguarded,

but they should not be over emphasized to the
extent of forgetting that the victims also have
rights”.
13. Collating the contemporary criminal procedural
law of the two countries of South Asia, one find that the

India’s Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, is analogous to
27

the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 of Pakistan. It also
does not contain any specific provision for recording of
evidence through video conferencing. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference section 273 of Criminal
Procedure Code of 1973 of (India), analogous to section
353 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 of Pakistan, is

reproduced below:-

“

273. Evidence to be taken in presence of

accused. Except as otherwise expressly provided,
all evidence taken in the course of the trial or
other proceeding shall be taken in the presence of
the accused, or, when his personal attendance is
dispensed with, in the presence of his pleader’.

As discussed in the preceding Para (8)

In case titled, “State _of Maharashtra Vs Dr. Pruful

B.Desai (AIR 2003 SC 2053), the Supreme Court of India

came across the question “whether a witness, namely,
Dr. Greenberg, must be compelled to come to India to
give evidence?. In response to it the Court held that the
Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, was an ongoing statutory
instrument and that doctrine contemporanea exposition
est optima et fortissimo in lege (the language of a statute
must be understood in the sense in which it was

understood when it was passed), has no application while
28

interpreting the Code. It further held that video
conferencing was an advancement in science and
technology which enabled one to see, hear and talk with
someone for away with the same ease as if he was present
before oneself. It was reiterated that recording of evidence
by video conferencing also satisfies the object provided in
Section 273 of Cr. PC viz the evidence be recorded in
presence of the accused. The accused and his counsel
could see the witness as clearly as if he was actually
sitting before them. In fact, the accused could see the
witness better than he would have if he was standing in
the dock in a crowded court room. The Court may observe
his or her demeanor and could even review it with a
playback facility. Further, the witness could be confronted
with documents or other material or statements in the

same manner as if he/she was in the Court.

In case titled, “Rama Naidu and another vs Smt. Vs

Ramadevi) the Andhra High Court has observed that:-

“Recording of evidence even in a criminal case
by way of video conferencing is permissible. So
long as the accused and/or his pleader is present
when the evidence is recorded by the said way it
is recording of evidence in the presence of the

accused as per the requirements of section 273
29

Cr.P.C. as per the procedure established by law.

The terms presence does not means physical
presence as it includes even virtual presence in

court by video and audio linkage between

both ends”. (emphasis supplied).
From bare reading of the above quoted Paras from the
landmark judgment (supra), coupled with delialic case
(ibid) it is justly and justifiably held that the video
conferencing is, in actual fact, merely an extension of the
trial chamber to the location of the witness. The accused is,
therefore, neither denied his right to confront the witness,
nor does he lose materially from the fact of physical
absence of the witness. It cannot, therefore, be said with
any justification that the testimony given by video link is a
violation of the right of accused to confront the witness as
provided under Section 353 Cr. PC. In essence, the physical
presence as provided by Section 353 Cr. PC is not sine qua

non for recording of statement of witness through video link.

14, In Pakistan, Article 164 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat
Order 1984, (reproduced above) empowers the Court to
admit any evidence that may have become available
because of technological advancement and by adding/
inserting the proviso to the effect that conviction on the

basis of modern devices or techniques maybe lawful.
30

Admittedly, the modern devices or techniques have not
been defined in the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 or in the
Code. However, according to Black’s Law dictionary Video
conferencing has been defined as “Real-time two way
transmission of video and audio signals over a LAN or
the internet. Also known as video teleconferencing”. By
now we are breathing in 21" Century which has seen
technological revolution and has enthralled not only
Pakistan but the entire world. The use of computers is not
limited to establish organizations or institutions but
available to every individual at swipe of a finger.
Information Technology has eased out almost every
humanized action. Video conferencing is an advancement
of science and technology which permits seeing, hearing
and talking with someone who is not physically present,
with the same facility and ease as if they were physically
present. Increasing reliance on electronic means of
communications, e-commerce and storage of information
in digital form has most certainly caused a need to
transform the law relating to information technology and
admissibility of electronic evidence both in civil and

criminal matters in Pakistan.
31

15. Section 10 of the Punjab Witness Protection Act,
2018, provides recording of evidence by video links, which
for the sake of convenience and ready reference is

reproduced below:-

10. Video link.— (1) When so directed by the court,
the Unit shall take special measures so that the court
may examine a witness through video link at a

location outside the court.

(2) Where it is not possible to have a video link in
the court room, the court may move to the place, as
determined by the Government in consultation with

the High Court, where such facility is available.

Explanation.— For purposes of this section, the
video-link means a live television link or other
arrangements whereby a witness, while away from
the court room or other place where the proceedings

are being held is:

a) able to see and hear a person there and
to be seen and heard by the persons

specified in section 9; and

b) able to be seen and heard by the
accused and the public unless the court

directs otherwise.
32

At this juncture, we will also refer to section 21 of the Anti
Terrorism Act, 1997, i.e. relating to the protection of
judges, counsel, public Prosecutor, witnesses and persons
concerned with the Court proceedings as inter alia, it also
provides about recording of proceedings through camera.
For the sake of convenience and ready reference, the same

is reproduced hereunder:-

“21. Protection of Judges, Counsel,
Public Prosecutor, witnesses and persons

concerned with Court proceedings:-

(2) For purpose of protection of the Judges,
accused, witnesses, prosecutor and defence
counsel and anyone concerned with the
court proceedings, the Government may
adopt such other measures as may be
appropriate or may be prescribed (and the
Armed Forces shall also provide
comprehensive protection and securing to
the Judges, members, accused, witnesses,
prosecutors, investigators, defence counsel
and all those concerned in the Court

proceedings.

These measures may include the following,

namely:-
33

a. Screens may be used during trial to shield
witnesses, Judges and Prosecutors from

public view;

b. Trial may be held in jail premises or

through video link;

c. Witness protection programmes may be
established by the Government through

law or rules (emphasis supplied).

16. In case, titled, “Salman Akram Raja and another
Vs_ Government of Punjab through Chief Secretary and
others (2013 SCMR 203)”, the Honourable Supreme Court
of Pakistan directed that in appropriate cases evidence of
rape victims should be recorded through video conference
so that the victims, particularly, the juvenile, may not have
to come to the Court. Relevant para of the above quoted

judgment is reproduce, which read,

“Trials in rape cases should be conducted in
camera and after regular courts hours.
During a rape trial, screens or other
arrangements should be made so that the
victims and vulnerable witnesses do not have
to face the accused person. Evidence of rape
victims should be recorded, in appropriate

cases, through video conferencing so that the
34

victims, particularly, juvenile victims, do not

need to be present in Court”.

Besides, in the Province of Punjab all the trial Courts have
been directed to record the evidence of Magistrates through

modern devices.

17. In a recent judgment rendered in case titled,
“Application by Hussain Nawaz Sharif’ CMA No.3986 in
CMA No.2939 of 2017 in Constitutional Petition No.29 of
2016 ete decided on 20" June, 2017 (PLD 2019 SC 196)
the Hon’ble Supreme Court has emphasized on the use of

modern technology in the following words:-

“In the age of computer where almost
everything was communicated and even
business of every type was transacted online,
emphasis on the form of doing a thing as it
used to be done in the year 1898, would
amount to putting at naught the dynamics of
scientific and technological advancements
which had not only liberated man from
exhausting labour but also made things easier.
Law in many countries of the East and the

West has been changed and even re-enacted.”

Likewise in case titled, “Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif

Vs the State” (PLD 2018 Islamabad High Court 148), the
35

worthy Islamabad High Court Islamabad, allowed recording
of evidence at High commission at London, of a witness via
video link/skype from United Kingdom in the presence of
authorized attorney/counsel or representative of the
accused. The relevant part of the judgment is reproduced

below:-

“Statements of above said two witnesses shall
be recorded through the video link. Witnesses
shall remain present in Office of High
Commission London. High Commissioner of
Pakistan there shall ensure that the witnesses
are not under any pressure, coercion or
influence at relevant time and their identity

shall also be verified by him.”

18. There are yet other instances of use of video link
technology in Pakistan. In the year 2018, an Accountability
Court at Islamabad allowed two witnesses of National
Accountability Bureau (NAB) to record their statements via
video link in a Reference against the former Prime Minister
on the application of the prosecution in the Landon
Avenfield Apartment case, on the ground that the witness
could not visit Pakistan due to security reasons and heavy
engagements. The trial Court allowed the two witnesses to

record their statements through video link at Pakistan High
36

Commission Landon. The Court while allowing the request
of prosecution ordered to make arrangements by installing

devices in the court for recording statements.

In May 2019, the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan in collaboration with the National Database and
Registration Authority (NADRA) had established a live
video link between the principal seat at Islamabad and its
four branch registries/Benches at Karachi, Lahore,
Peshawar and Quetta, whereby the lawyer and litigants
instead of travelling to principal seal, stay at their local
cities and participate in the case proceedings via video

conferencing from their nearest registry.

19. In view of the above omnibus discussion, we are
firm in our view to hold that laws of various countries allow
courts to record evidence through video conferencing, but
the witness while making statement on video link has been
kept under supervision of a judicial or executive officer for
the purpose of maintenance of court decorum and to
supervise the conduct, demeanor and attitude of witness.
Certainly, the person giving evidence on video link is to be
governed by the same law as applicable to a witness
physically appearing before the trial court for recording

his/her testimony. In case of whatsApp call or any other
37

independent mode of call, the witness may be considered
present in the court, albeit without any strong supervision at
the witness end, there would be always difficult and
awkward situation for the trail court, particularly if witness
commits contempt of court or perjuries himself and it
immediately noticed that he has perjures himself. The
identification of witness and administering oath to the
person to be examined on video link could be another state
of inconvenience for the court and prosecution. To shun
such contingencies, as a matter of prudence, the evidence of
a person should be recorded in open court, if the witness is
inside the country. Nevertheless if a witness is unable to
attend the trial court due to serious reasons, the prosecution
is to submit an application at the earliest for examining of
such witness through video link from the court of
corresponding jurisdiction or Session Judge of the District
or Tehsil where the witness resides or having temporary

abode.

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, all the courts in District Judiciary
have been equipped with all kind of modern digital and
technological facilities. Fiber optic equipments have been
set out almost in all the courts, so in case of recording

evidence of a witness in any district would hardly create a
38

difficulty if the witness is directed to appear in the Court of

Session Judge of the district where he resides

If the witness is outside the province, an arrangement may
be made through Registrar of High Court of the province
where the witness has a permanent residence or temporarily
settled, but where the witness is abroad i.e. in a country or
place out of Pakistan, the Registrar of High Court in
collaboration with foreign ministry shall arrange a video
conference for the witness in the office of Pakistan
Embassy, High Commission or Consulate in the country
where the witness is to be examined. The establishment of
Virtual Court Room under the supervision of an officer
from Embassy/Consulate or alongwith a qualified technical
personal in video link operation shall be ensured by the
Foreign Ministry. The responsible officer of Embassy or of
the High Commission for the purpose of supervision of
conduct and demeanor of the witnesses and maintaining
decorum of the Court would be vested with the power of

trial court.

20. At the cost of repetition, we shall reiterate it that
the use of modern technology, most particularly the tool of
video conferencing cannot be over sighted or ignored as it

will push the judicial system in the dark alley. To the
39

contrary, it will not only give boost to the justice system,
but also save a lot of time, money, unnecessary movement
of litigants and congestion in the court rooms and its
precinct. It would be more beneficial to prosecution for
producing their witnesses as well as to accused for
expeditious disposal of his case. Mostly, the criminal
statutes provide a specific time for resolution of the cases
and it is also primary concern of the court and public
regarding the expeditious disposal of the cases. One
amongst few, the major cause of delay in disposal of the
cases is non appearance of witness due to their non
availability. In most of the cases we have noted that the
police official/prosecution witnesses avoid appearing before
the courts for recording statement, because of their transfer
from one station to another or from one province to another
province. Likewise, in cases involving medico legal or
postmortem, if a medical officer proceeded abroad in
connection with his/her higher studies, the courts ordinarily
wait till his/her return. Not only these, but many other alike
and artificial hurdles can be removed by adopting the
innovative technological devices in the justice delivery
system, though with necessary safeguard and precautions.
There was need to make statutory changes in the Criminal

and Civil Procedure Codes to develop a better approach
40

towards criminal and civil trial and to minimize the burden
on investigation/prosecution and courts, but all such errands
and functions, have been performed by courts in Pakistan
and also in most of the developed countries. These days,
courts in this province have become more and more lenient
in recording the evidence through modern devices and even
to hear arguments of counsels via video link, but
unfortunately without saying proper guidelines, Standard
Operating Procedure (SOP) or statuary procedure by any
authority, therefore, in case of recording evidence through
electronic devices, the following protocol/ guidelines shall
be observed by the trial courts in the province of Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa.

(1) Guidelines for conducting proceeding between

trial court and court where witness shall appear.

For the purpose of these guidelines, reference to the
“trial court” shall mean, where the trial is pending and
witness attendance required, whereas the “witness end”
shall be the place / court, where witness appears for

recording his statement via video link.

In appropriate cases, the trial court may direct or allow a

witness to be examined on video link.
ili.

41

At any time, on application of a party or on its own
initiative, the trial court may make direction in open court
or in chamber for recording any testimony of a witness

intra province, inter provision or oversees Pakistan.

The direction of the court for recording evidence of
witness on behest of parties be sought through a proper
application at the earliest, showing reasonable ground for
inability of the witness to personally appear before the
trial court. Notice of such application be given to the other
party or counsel on the same date of filing application and
the trial court may discuss it with the party under notice.
In case of consensus between the parties the trial court
shall proceed further, however in case of contest of
application, the trial judge after hearing the parties shall
pass an appropriate order in writing, granting leave or

otherwise.

The proceedings by way of video conference shall be
conducted as judicial proceedings and the same courtesies
and protocol shall be observed at both end viz trial court
and court where witness is appearing for making
statement. All the relevant provision of procedural and
penal Code including the provision of Qanoon-e-Shahadat

Order shall apply to the recording of evidence by video
42

technology; however, these guidelines shall not be

applicable to proceedings under section 164 of Cr. PC.

2. There shall be coordinator at both sides i.e trial
court as well as at the witness end. The trial judge shall
act as coordinator at trial court side while at the witness

end, the coordinator may be any of the following officials.

a. Where the witness is to be examined intra
province, the judicial officer of equal
jurisdiction of the trial court or the Session
Judge of District at witness end or any
judicial officer not below the rank of
Additional Session Judge shall be

coordinator.

b. Whereas the witness is to be examined is in
other province including Azad Kashmir and
Gilgit Baltistan, and Islamabad, the judicial
officer of the equal jurisdiction or the
Session Judge of the district where the
witness is permanently or temporarily
settled subject to availability of video link
facility at that District shall be coordinator.

In case of non availability of internet/video
43

link facility at the witness end, the
coordinator shall be nominated by the
Registrar of the concerned High Court in

any other nearest districts.

. Whereas the witness to be examined is

abroad and overseas, the trial court through
Registrar of the High Court shall coordinate
with the Foreign Ministry to nominate the
official of Embassy/ /High Commissioner/
Consulate of Pakistan to be a coordinator as
well to arrange all necessary requirements
including virtual court at witness end. The
responsible officer Embassy/High
Commissioner/Consulate shall be deputed
for supervision, identification and
administering oath etc to the witness. The
officer shall be vested with the power of trial

court for purpose of recording of statement.

. Whereas the person to be examined is a
convict or otherwise in a jail in connection
with any offence, the concerned jail
superintendant shall produce him before the

Session Judge of the District where the
44

convict/prisoner is lodged. For production of
the witness, the Superintendent Jail shall
adhere to the order of District & Session
Judge at the witness end. In case the witness
is juvenile lodged at Borstal House or a lady
with residence at shelter home/ Dar-ul-
Aman etc, the concerned Incharge shall be
under obligation to follow the directions of

Sessions Judge at the witness end.

. Whereas the witness is to be examined is
hospitalized in any Provincial or Federal
hospital or public sector hospital, the
coordinator (Sessions Judge of concerned
District) shall of its own or appoint any
judicial officer as commissioner to visit the
hospital for recording the statement of
patient/witness. The Coordinator shall make
correspondence with the Medical Officer or
Incharge of the hospital for providing
necessary internet facilities at the premises
of patient/witness. The Medical

Superintendent/Incharge of the Hospital
45

shall associate the Sessions Judge or his

nominee at the witness end.

f. In case of any other person/witness, as may
be ordered by the Sessions Judge at witness

end.

3. The Sessions Judge or his/her nominee at the
witness end shall ensure the attendance of witness through
all means prescribed by the provisions of Procedural,
Penal Codes and Qanoon-e-Shadat Order 1984. The
prosecutors shall assist the court at trial court as well as at

witness end.

4, In case, the person is witness of record, the
prosecution shall be under obligation to provide the
attested copies of entire record to witness to enable him/
her in recording of his/her examination in Chief/Cross
examination/re-examination or to confront him with any
document etc. The trial court, at the time of allowing
witness to be examined on video link, shall record the
direction, of the prosecution in the case to make all
necessary arrangements for ensuring the production of

witness and availability of record at witness end.
46

5. In case of any difficulty in understanding the court
language by the witness, the prosecutor shall bring in to
the notice of trial court, at initial stage, on his application.
The District Prosecutor, at witness end, shall arrange a
translator/interpreter, who, on closing of the statement of
witness, shall furnish a certificate to that effect, duly

signed digitally.

6. Whereas the witness is beyond Pakistan i.e
overseas, the prosecution shall provide the record of the
witness while the coordinator at witness end i.e
Ambassador/Counselor/High Commission — shall be
appraised through foreign ministry of Pakistan to make
necessary arrangements for translator/Interpreter as

prescribed in preceding Para-5.

7. Where the person is to be examined as court
witness, the prosecution and where a person is to be
examined as defence witness, the defence counsel will be
under obligation to confirm to the court the exact location
and willingness of witness to be examined by video link at
the witness end. In case the witness is an accused and his
attendance is dispensed with by the trial court during trial,
the counsel for defence will confirm his location and

availability of video link facility at that side.
47

8. Where the person is an accused in the case and
trial court allowed him/her to record his statement on
video link, and where the defence counsel requested that
in the course of recording statement on video link some
privileged communication would be required between the
counsel and accused, the trial court will pass an

appropriate order and directions in that regard.

9. At the request of a person to be examined on video
link, or the trial court on its own motion, taking in to
account the best possible interest of the person to be
examined and arrival at just and proper conclusion subject
to relevant provision(s) of Procedural, Penal Codes and
Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, shall pass appropriate
direction to protect the privacy of witness keeping in mind

his age, gender and physical condition.

10. The record of proceedings, including typing and
preparation of hard copy of statement(s) of the witness(s),
marking all exhibits on documents at judicial file shall be
made and prepared by the trial court. In case signature of
the witness or coordinator or Sessions Judge or witness is
required to be taken on statement or document, the soft
copy shall be transmitted to the Sessions Judge at witness

end through electronic means including Fax, scan or E-
48

Mail, where it will be converted in to hard copy and after

of Audio and Video record may be kept intact till decision

of the case/appeal.

12. Any expenses incurred on recording of statement
via video link shall be borne by the party, on whoes
application or behest the statement is to be recorded. In
case the person to be examined is a court witness, or the
trial court, on its own motion, in the interest of witness,
has ordered to allow recording statement on video link,
the cost of expenditure shall be paid by the party at trial

court, in whose favor such statement is recorded.

13. Recording of statement of conclusion at video link
shall ordinarily take place during the local hours at
Pakistan. Where the witness is oversees, the trial court
may pass suitable direction with regard to timing as the

circumstances dictate.

14. = The Information Technology (IT) expert shall be

allowed to be present during recording statement of a
49

witness, if he/she is not cited as witness in the case. The
(IT) expert shall establish and regulate the connection
disconnection and reconnection of links between the trial
court and court or place at witness end. He/she shall
further ensure and satisfy the trial court and judge/
coordinator at witness end, about clear visibility and loud

audible voice at both ends.

15. Before starts of the video link, the witness shall
disclose his/her identity before the judge/coordinator at
witness end and likewise picture/photograph of his/her
national identity card/passport/domicile shall be pasted at
screen for the purpose of identification in the trial court.
As soon as the identification process is completed, oath
would be administered to the witness by the judge/
coordinator at witness end, loudly audible and clearly

visible at trial court end.

16. = The learned judge/coordinator shall ensure that the
witness is not coached, tortured or prompted by any
person. The witness, if willing, shall be allowed to engage
a counsel for his assistance or to remain present with
him/her at the witness end, when the evidence is being

recorded.
50

17.‘ The trial court and judge/coordinator at witness
end will ensure that once the process of recording of
statement on video link commences, as for as practicable
and possible, it shall be kept continued to proceed without
any break, interruption and without any adjournment at

any cause or cost.

18. The Session Judge/coordinator, if needed or
observed, may record any remark or observation as is
material regarding the demeanor, attitude or conduct of
the witness end and will transmit it to the trial court

through electronic mode of transmission.

19. The Registrar of this court shall ensure, at least, to
equip all the District courts with minimum required
electronic/digital appliances i.e computer set, laptop,
video cameras microphone and speaker, display unit,
documents visualizers, scanner, setting arrangement in the
court rooms at both sides, printer and uninterrupted fast

internet connection.

20. These guidelines, are just directory and also not all
inclusive and comprehensive, therefore the court while
recording statement on video link may resort to legally

permissible steps not in conflict to these guidelines though
51

and befitting the facts and circumstances of a particular
case. Any such matter with respect to which no express
provision has been made in these guidelines, the trial
court may adopt any permissible and convenient mode to

meet the end of justice..

21. For what has been discussed above, we have
reached to an irresistible conclusion that statement of Saeed
Ullah as (PW.9) in the instant case through video call i.e.
IMO from Saudi Arabia has not been recorded in
accordance with the above formulated guidelines. Similar is
the case of statement of Faisal Khan (PW.6) in the
connected criminal appeals. In this view of the matter,
conviction and sentence of appellant-convict Muhammad
Israr in the instant case recorded vide judgment dated
12.09.2019, and conviction and sentences of appellant
Hafiz Naveed Ahmad and Rehmat Khan, recorded vide
judgment dated 29.10.2019, are hereby set aside. The cases
are remanded to the respective learned trial courts for
recording the statements of the above named PWs either on
their physical presence before the Court and, if it is not
possible, then it may be recorded through video
links/conferencing by following the guidelines (supra) and

then to decide the cases on merits in accordance with law.
52

During this period the appellants-convicts shall remain as
under trial prisoners. Resultantly, the instant appeal and the
connected Cr. A. No.1329-P of 2019 and Cr.A. No.1336-
P/2019, are disposed of accordingly. On setting aside the
conviction and sentences of the appellants-convicts, the
connected Cr. R. No.245-P/2019 and Cr. R. No.302-
P/2019, filed by Juma Said and Faisal Khan, for
enhancement of sentences of the convicts having become
infructuous, are hereby dismissed. However, Cr. A.
No.1142-P/2018, filed by Muhammad Israr against his
conviction under section 13/15 KP Arms Act, is adjourned
and shall remain pending before this Court till decision of

the main case by the trial court.

22. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court
shall circulate copy of this judgment amongst all District &
Sessions Courts of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
for guidance and shall also send a copy thereof to the
worthy Secretary of Law and Parliamentary Affairs,
Pakistan Islamabad and Law = secretary, Khyber
Pakhtukhwa, for the purpose of proper legislation on the
subject at their respective ends in the relevant laws of the

country.
53

23. Before parting with the judgment, we thankfully
record our appreciation for the valuable assistance rendered
by the worthy Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
assisted by Mr. Muhammad Nisar Khan, Assistant
Advocate General. We also appreciate the enormous
research work done by Mr. Ali Gohar Durarni, Advocate
who appeared and assisted the court as amicus curae and
Mr. Syed Shakir Hussain Shah, Assistant Research Officer,
High Court Library, Peshawar High Court Peshawar and
also the valuable argument advanced by M/s. Jala-ud-din
Akbar Azam Khan Gara, Ghulam Mohy-ud-Din Malik,

Shabir Hussain Gigyani & Asad Yousafzai, Advocates.
