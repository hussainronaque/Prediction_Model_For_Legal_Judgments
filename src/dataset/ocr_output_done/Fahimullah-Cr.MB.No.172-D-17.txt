MUHAMMAD _AYUB_ KHAN, J.- Having failed to get the

concession of bail from the Courts of learned Judicial Magistrate-II,

D.I.Khan and learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I-Khan vide

orders dated 12.4.2017 and 19.4.2017 respectively, accused/

petitioner Faheem Ullah has filed the instant petition for the same

relief in case FIR No.308 dated 05.4.2017 registered under Section

489-F PPC at Police Station Cantt, D.I.Khan.

Rs.2,18,00,000/- from him for the purpose of business of medicine

and in this regard on 26.7.2016, he issued two cheques i.e. one

cheque bearing No.34414728 amounting to Rs.1,18,00,000/- and

other cheque bearing No.34414729 amounting to Rs.10000000/- of

Habib Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for encashment

on 25.3.2017 and also scribed an Jgrar Nama dated 26.7.2016 in

favour of complainant in presence of witnesses namely Muhammad

Ramzan and Din Muhammad. On 28.3.2017, the complainant

submitted cheque No.34414729 worth Rs.100,00000/- in his

account at United Bank Ltd. Circular Road Branch, D.I.Khan for

transfer of amount from the account of accused/petitioner but it was

dishonoured due to insufficient funds. On the application of

complainant/respondent No.2 above referred FIR was registered

against the accused/petitioner.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Admittedly, the accused/petitioner issued the cheque

in question to the complainant which was dishonoured vide cheque

return memo dated 28.3.2017 for reason of insufficient fundsâ€™,

which prima facie establish that the petitioner was having no

intention to pay the outstanding amount to the complainant. The act

of the petitioner amounts to financial murder of the complainant.

5. It is also on the record that the accused/petitioner

issued cheque of Rs.2,75,00,000/- in favour of one Zawail which

was dishonoured and in this respect a case vide FIR No.245 dated

21.3.2017 was registered under Section 489-PPC at Police Station

Cantt, D.I-Khan against the accused/petitioner which prima facie

suggest that he is habitual offender of issuance of cheques and

defrauding the people.

6. No doubt the case in hand is not covered by the

prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C, but that alone cannot hold

the petitioner entitled to the concession of bail. In such like cases,

grant of bail is not a rule of universal application and each case is to

be decided on the basis of its own merits keeping in view its own

set of facts and circumstances. Reliance may safely be placed on

Muhammad Siddique. Vs. Imtiaz Begum _and two others (2002

SCMR 442), Shameel Ahmad. Vs. The State (2009 SCMR_ 174

and Muhammad Imran. Vs. The State and another (2012 YL R

2748).

Imran/*

7. The tentative assessment of the available record prima
facie connects the accused/petitioner with the commission of the
offence and he is not entitled to the concession of bail.

Consequently, his instant petition for release on bail is dismissed.

Announced.
