Cr.B.A.No.S-1142 
of  2009
 
For hearing
 
 
31.12.2009.
 
Ms Rizwana Jabeen Siddiqui for the applicant.
Mr.Shyam Lal,
Assistant Prosecutor General for the State.
             ..............
 
      The bail plea is pressed on the grounds
that the present applicant along with co-accused nominated in the F.I.R are
alleged to have caused injuries from their respective weapons i.e. the present
applicant is alleged to have fired from his Kalashnikov while co-accused Asad nominated in the F.I.R is alleged to have fired from
his Repeater and four firearm injuries were sustained by the complainant Zulfiqar Ali on right hand, left arm, left leg and left
side of neck but during the course of investigation the co-accused nominated in
the F.I.R having similar and identical role, has been let off by the police,
the injuries sustained by the complainant have been opined by the medico legal
officer to have been caused by gunshot, as pellets have been recovered and that
there is delay of five days in lodging the F.I.R; therefore, according to
learned counsel the case of present applicant with regard to participation in
the commission of offence or causing injuries from his Kalashnikov require
further enquiry.
 
      Mr.Shyam Lal, learned Assistant Prosecutor General has confirmed the
above position but has opposed the grant of bail on the ground that section 324
PPC has been applied which will fall within the prohibitory clause of section
497, Cr.P.C but he concedes to the position hat the
injuries sustained by the complainant will fall under Section 337-F (iii) PPC
which provides punishment of three years.
 
      Admittedly there is inordinate delay of
five days in lodging the F.I.R, the co-accused Asad
having similar role has been let off by the police, the medico legal opinion is
in conflict with ocular version and the injuries so sustained by the injured
will not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C
and it is yet to be determined that whether section 324 PPC is applicable in
the instant case and all these grounds will require further enquiry in the
matter.
 
      In view of above position, this bail
application is allowed. The applicant shall be released subject to his
furnishing a solvent surety in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (one lac)
and P.R. bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court.
