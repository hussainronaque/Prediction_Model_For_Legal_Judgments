OK 2 2

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- Having failed to get the
concession of bail from the Court of learned Sessions
Judge, Karak vide order dated 02.5.2017, accused/
petitioner Eid Badshah involved in case F.I.R No.270
dated 14.4.2016 registered under Sections 324/337-D
PPC at Police Station Karak, District Karak, has filed
the instant petition for the same relief.

2. Brief facts of the case, as narrated in the
FIR, are that on 14.4.2016 at 0705 hours, injured Aqib
Nawaz was brought to Emergency Room of K.D.A.

Hospital, Karak who was not in proper senses and his

uncle Zar Janan reported to the local police that they

have landed property known as Walishkai situated near

the house of accused/petitioner wherein wheat crop

was cultivated. On the eventful day, he alongwith

injured Aqib Nawaz and his sister in law Mst. Rahman

Zadi went to the land for supervision and in the

meanwhile accused/petitioner duly armed with

Kalashnikov came and fired at his nephew Aqib

Nawaz in order to kill him, as a result, he got hit and

sustained injuries. On the report of complainant

murasila was drafted and sent to the Police Station on

the basis of which instant FIR got registered.

3. Learned counsel for accused/petitioner

argued that there is no independent witness of the

occurrence and the accused/petitioner has been

charged with malafide intention after due consultations

and deliberations. He submitted that the FSL report

regarding recovery of empties and the MLC report of

the victim do not support the prosecution version. He

further contended that nothing has been recovered

Imran/*
-3-

from direct possession of the accused/petitioner and

case against him is one of further inquiry, therefore, he

is entitled for the concession of bail.

4. Conversely, learned Asstt: A.G. assisted

by private counsel for the complainant opposed the

bail petition by arguing that the accused/petitioner is

directly charged in the FIR for causing injuries to the

victim on vital part of his body. They contended that

the occurrence took place at day time, therefore,

question of mistaken identity cannot arise. They

further contended that the accused/petitioner was

arrested by the local police after about one year of the

occurrence and during this period he remained fugitive

from law. They concluded that prima facie the

accused/petitioner is connected with the commission

of the offence, therefore, he is not entitled to the

concession of bail.

5. I have carefully gone through the record

and considered the arguments of learned counsel for

the parties as well as learned Asstt: A.G for the State.

6. It appears from the record that the

petitioner is singularly and directly charged in the FIR

for making effective firing at complainant party due to

which Aqib Nawaz, the nephew of complainant

sustained injuries. During the course of investigation,

the investigating officer recovered nine (09) empties of

7.62 bore from the place of occurrence which were

sent to the FSL and according to Fire Arms Expert

report these empties were fired from different 7.62

bore weapons which certainly raises a question as to

whether the unfortunate act is the doing of one person

or more. This factor alone takes the matter to one of

further probe. The MLC report of the victim suggests

that he sustained wound on the back side of chest and

in this way the MLC report also does not support the

case of prosecution.

7. So far as abscondence of petitioner is

concemed, mere absconsion is not a conclusive proof

of guilt of accused person. It is only a suspicious

circumstance against an accused that he was found

Imran/*
-5-

guilty of the offence. However, suspicions after all are

suspicions. The same cannot take the place of proof.

The value of abscondence, therefore, depends on the

facts of each case. The absconsion of the accused may

be consistent with the guilt or innocence of the

accused, which is to be decided keeping in view over

all facts of the case. Mere abscondence of accused

could not be made the basis for his conviction as

accused could run away due to fear or suspicious

circumstances. No doubt, abscondence is a relevant

fact, but it can be used as a corroborative piece of

evidence, which cannot be read in isolation but has to

be read alongwith substantive piece of evidence.

Reliance is placed on case titled “Rohtas Khan Vs.

The State” (2010 SCMR 566), Rahimullah Jan Vs.

Kashif_and_ another” (PLD 2008 Supreme Court

298.”

8. The petitioner despite remaining in police

custody has made no confession before the competent

Court nor any weapon of offence has been recovered

Imran/*
-6-
from his possession or at his instance and pointation.
He is behind the bar since his arrest and no more
required to the local police for further investigation,
therefore, keeping him behind the bar would serve no
useful purpose.

9. In view of what has been observed above,
this petition is allowed and the petitioner is admitted to
bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lac) with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate.

10. Above are detailed reasons of my short
order of even date.

Announced.
