2. The report was lodged by Mst. Bakhti
Rojan (PW-11), sister of deceased Shamsher Khan,
on 05.03.2019 at 11:00 hours on the spot i.e
thoroughfare of Petao Kambelo, Hasham Khel
Banda. According to her report, her deceased
brother was residing at Karachi. A few days ago he
had visited his parents living in their ancestral
village Surgah, District Shangla. He was leaving for
Karachi at morning on the day of occurrence
whereas complainant, Mst. Sufia (abandoned PW
mother of the deceased) and Mst. Bibi Saina (PW-
12) (sister-in-law of the deceased), while carrying
his luggage, were accompanying him towards
Hasham Khel Dabb to see him off. When they
reached the place of occurrence at 09:00 A.M, the
present appellants duly armed came out of their
house and started firing at them, as result whereof

Shamsher Khan was hit on different parts of his

Bin

body and died on the spot, while the ladies escaped
narrowly from the firing. Complainant stated ahead
in her report that the appellants thereafter ran in the
direction of Petao Warsho where Mst. Zarkhewa,
wife of appellant Ahmad Shah, was busy in cutting
grass with Mst. Sakina and Mst. Lubna etc. They
fired at her thereby causing multiple firearm injuries
on her body due to which she also died on the spot.
SHO Sirajul Haq S.I (PW-1) drafted Murasila on the
report of complainant and sent the same through a
constable to P.S Kamach where FIR was chalked out
against the present appellants on the basis of

Murasila.

3. The author of Murasila also prepared
injury sheets and inquest reports of both the
deceased and sent the dead bodies to THQ Hospital,
Puran. Post-mortem on the dead body of deceased
Mst. Zarkhewa was conducted by Dr. Najma Begum
(PW-2) whose report is available on record as
Ex.PM. Dead body of deceased Shamsher Khan was
medically examined by Dr. Imran Khan (PW-5).
Post-mortem report of the said deceased is Ex.PM,
pictorial is Ex.PM/1, answers to questionnaire of
police is Ex.PM/2 whereas endorsement of the

doctor on inquest report is Ex.PM/3.

4. Appellant Ahmad Shah was arrested on
the following day of the occurrence. On 09.03.2019
he confessed his guilt before Judicial Magistrate by
recording his statement u/s 164/364, Cr.P.C.
Appellant Muhammad Zahir Shah was arrested on
24.03.2019. During the course of investigation,
statements u/s 164, Cr.P.C of Syed Ahmad Shah,
brother of deceased Mst. Zakhewa, Mst. Sakina Bibi
and Mst. Lubna, daughter-in-law and daughter of
appellant Ahmad Shah respectively, were recorded
on 14.03.2019. The crime weapon 9 mm pistol was
recovered on pointation of appellant Ahmad Shah
which was sent to FSL alongwith 02 crime empties
of the same bore besides five empties of 30 bore
pistol recovered from the spot of first occurrence
were also sent to FSL. The FSL report Ex.PK is
positive for pistol and empties of 9 mm bore with
further observations that the five 30 bore crime
empties were fired from one and the same pistol.
After arrest of appellant Muhammad Zahir Shah, the
other crime weapon 30 bore pistol was recovered on
his pointation which, as per FSL report Ex.PK/2 has
matched with the above referred five crime empties

of 30 bore.

5. On completion of _ investigation,
complete challan was put in Court and the trial
commenced against the present appellants with
framing of formal charge. The appellants denied the
charge and opted to face trial, therefore, prosecution
produced and examined 13 PWs in support of its
case and closed the evidence. When examined u/s
342, Cr.P.C, both the appellants denied the
allegations of prosecution besides appellant Ahmad
Shah also retracted his judicial confession, however,
they neither recorded their own statements on oath
nor produced any witness in their defence. On
conclusion of trial, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment convicted and sentenced the
appellants in the manner already discussed in detail
in the earlier part of this judgment, hence, this

appeal.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned
Assistant A.G. for State and gone through the record

with their able assistance.

Z. Prosecution has based its case against

the present appellant on ocular account furnished by

complainant Mst. Bakht Rojana (PW-11) and Mst.

Saina (PW-12), confessional statement of appellant
Ahmad Shah and incriminating recoveries in shape of
blood-stained earth/grass, crime empties collected
from both the spots, blood-stained clothes of both the
deceased and recovery of crime weapons i.e 30 bore
pistol on pointation appellant Muhammad Zahir Shah
and pistol of 9 MM bore on pointation of appellant

Ahmad Shah.

8. One of the eye-witnesses is complainant
Mst. Bakht Rojana (PW-11), who is sister of the
deceased while the second eye-witness is Mst. Saina
(PW-12) who is sister-in-law of the deceased.
Admittedly, both the eye-witnesses, being closely
related with the deceased, are interested witnesses
besides they are chance witnesses as they have
claimed that they were accompanying the deceased at
the relevant time, as such, it is the foremost duty of
prosecution to establish that they were present on the
spot in the company of deceased at the time of
occurrence. It was observed by august Supreme
Court in the case of ‘Mazhar Iqbal and another Vs.
The State and_others’ (2017 SCMR_ 2036) that
testimony of a chance witness cannot be readily
accepted unless they justify their presence at the

crime spot through cogent reasons. Thus, the

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/PS*

a Fix
statements of the eye-witnesses in the present case, in
view of their above-stated position, is required to be

adjudged with great care and caution.

It is the version of eye-witnesses that the
deceased, who was residing at Karachi with his
family, had come to Shangla to see his parents and
they alongwith mother of the deceased namely Mst.
Sophia, were accompanying him to see him off as he
was going back to Karachi on the day of occurrence.
It is also the version of prosecution that complainant
was carrying bag of the deceased while Mst. Saina
was having a shopping bag in her hands while
moving alongwith the deceased towards the main
road at Hasham Khel Dabb situated at a walking
distance of 30 minutes from their house. The above
version of both the eye witnesses is repellent to
reason because as per prevalent customs of this area
women folk seldom accompany their male relatives
for seeing them off as the said job is usually
performed by male members of the family. It is also
astonishing that no other male was in their company
except the deceased at the relevant time and they
would have to come back all alone after parting with

the deceased, the said manner of departure and return

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

Qe
of the eye-witnesses is repellent to traditions and

culture in this area.

It is also a matter of record that the dead
body remained on the spot for two hours till arrival
of police but neither the eye witnesses nor anybody
else shifted the dead body to police station or
hospital. How can it be expected from eye-witnesses
that their near and dear was done to death in their
presence but they remained silent spectators for two
hours without making any effort either to inform
male members of their house or to inform the local
police or other relatives though their house is at
walking distance of only 30 minutes from the spot. In
the present era of modern technology when the entire
world has become a global village and imparting a
message now a days is just a matter of seconds, how
the dead body laid unattended on the spot for two
hours inspite of the fact that so many people had
attracted to the spot soon after the occurrence as per
prosecution version. It is also an admitted fact on the
record that the eye witnesses have not even touched
the dead body though the assailants had decamped
from the spot and for the said reason their clothes did
not smear with the blood of deceased. This conduct

of the eye-witnesses is also unusual because women

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

-9-

folk by their nature usually become more emotional
as compared to males on the occasions of death of a
family member. At such events women usually
embrace and hug the dead bodies of their nears and
dears especially when the matter is that of unnatural
death but the eye-witnesses in the present case have
not displayed the same conduct which is their epithet
at such occasions. The unusual and unnatural conduct
of the eye-witnesses create doubts about their
presence at the place and time of occurrence. In the

case of ‘Muhammad Ismail and others Vs. The State’

(2017_SCMR_ 898), the august Supreme Court,

disbelieved the ocular account of a witness in view of

his unusual and unnatural conduct by observing that:

The prosecution had produced Haq Nawaz
(PW4) and Abdul Shakoor (PW5) who had
claimed to have seen some of the appellants
throwing two dead bodies in a well during
the fateful night which throwing of the dead
bodies had statedly been seen by them in the
light of a torch. The conduct displayed by the
said witnesses has been found by us to be far
from being satisfactory, usual or even natural
because on their own showing the said
witnesses had, after witnessing throwing of
the dead bodies in a well, gone to their own
houses and had slept during the night and
when they returned to the relevant place in
the morning the local police had already
reached there.

9. As per prosecution version, complainant

was carrying the bag of deceased while the other

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-10-
eye-witness Mst. Saina was having a shopping bag
of the deceased while on their way to Hasham Khel
Dabb in the company of deceased. It is strange
enough that the Investigating Officer has neither
taken the referred luggage of deceased into
possession nor shown the same in the site plan to
have corroborated the version of complainant
regarding departure of deceased to Karachi on the
day of occurrence. Said omission on the part of I.O
shows that the version of complainant as narrated in
the FIR regarding departure of the deceased is only a

concocted story. Reliance in this regard is place on

“The State V/s. Muhammad Akram” (PLD 1985
Peshawar 116) wherein it has been held that:-

“The sickles were, however, not recovered
from the spot and we can, therefore, presume
that they were not there because they had not
been carried by Mst. Karam Jan (PW-7) and
her brother Mian Dad (PW-8). The statement
given at the trial by Mst. Karam Jan (PW-7)
in this regard appears to be a concoction.
Now, if the story of carrying of sickles by
Mst. Karam Jan and her brother Mian Dad
was not to be accepted, then the presence of
these two witnesses on the spot at the relevant
time shall also stand excluded as there would
have been no reason for them to be present
there. In the least, the non-recovery of sickles
from the spot did create a doubt as to the
correctness of the prosecution story disclosed
at the trial............ The Investigating Officer
has not shown in the site-plan any such
damage to the crop by the she-buffalo of
Akram, accused-respondent, although he was

Tajamul/Ps* SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
it.

aware of this fact being the immediate cause
of the attack allegedly made by the accused-
respondents on the deceased. We are not
prepared to accept that if the ‘jowar’ crop of
the deceased had actually been damaged by
the she-buffalo of Akram,  accused-
respondent, then such fact, though forming
immediate cause of attack on the deceased by
the accused-respondents, could go unnoticed
by the Investigating Officer at the time of
investigation or the preparation of the site-
plan. Had such damage to the crop been
caused, the Investigating Officer, in all
probability, would have shown it in the site
plan prepared by him. Once this fact was
removed out of the chain of facts started at
then the whole chain was broken and the
prosecution story became doubtful, if not
false, as there would have been no immediate
cause for the accused-respondents to have
attacked the deceased. It was also possible
that the incident had taken place not in the
manner alleged by the prosecution and
disclosed at the trial but in some other way,
and if that were so, the prosecution was to
suffer therefor and not the accused-
respondents ”.

Even otherwise, carrying of loads is

usually the job of males and it cannot be expected
from the deceased to let his sister and sister-in-law,
being of fair sex, carry his bag and shopping bag
without carrying any luggage himself. There is no
evidence on record to show that the deceased was
sick or otherwise incapable of carrying any load

himself at the relevant time.

10. Statements of both the eye-witnesses

are also unreliable for the reason that not only they

Tajamul/Ps*| SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
bl ire i ir Ahm;
Tajamul/Ps*|

= {(Z.
have contradicted each other on material particulars
of the occurrence but they have also dishonestly
improved their statements to bring the same in
conformity with circumstantial evidence on record.
Complainant stated in her cross-examination that on
arrival of police, the dead body of Mst. Zarkhewa
had not been brought to the spot of first occurrence
while PW Mst. Saina stated that dead body of Mst.
Zarkhewa and police reached the spot at the same
time. The aforesaid divergent versions of both the
eye-witnesses regarding the same material fact do
not tally with the version of SHO Siraj-ul-Haq SI
(PW-1) in FIR as according to him the dead body of
Shamsher Khan was lying on the spot while the
people had shifted the dead body of Mst. Zarkhewa
from Petao Warsho to Hasham Khel Banda. When
appeared in the witness box, complainant stated that
Mst. Saina was walking in the front who was
followed by Mst. Sophia while she herself was
walking behind Mst. Sophia and at the last deceased
Shamsher Khan was walking. She stated ahead that
the appellants appeared armed with pistols; Zahir
Shah made first firing at the deceased hitting him on
right side of his neck then the deceased was hit on

right side of his chest below axilla by the firing

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim,
\m:
Tajamul/Ps*

-13-
Ahmad Shah and thereafter Zahir Shah again made
firing thereby hitting the deceased on his right thigh.
The complainant also stated in her examination-in-
chief that the appellants threatened them and
decamped from the spot by making aerial firing.
Almost similar statement was recorded by PW Mst.
Saina during the trial proceedings. The above
narrations of the eye witnesses with regard to their
order of walking on the thoroughfare, specification
of firearms and specification of the roles of both the
appellants with regard to injuries sustained by
deceased do not occur in the FIR. The defence
counsel has confronted both the eye witnesses with
their statements u/s 161, Cr.P.C during their cross-
examination which shows that the eye-witnesses
have dishonestly improved their initial version to
bring their statements in line with site plan and
medical evidence. Dishonest improvements on the
part of a witness casts a serious doubt on his veracity
and the topic was elaborately discussed by august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in a recent judgment in
the case of ‘Naveed Asghar and 02 others Vs. The

State’ (PLD 2021 S.C 600) by observing that:

17. Deliberate and dishonest
improvements made by a witness in his
statement to strengthen the prosecution case

SB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamut/Ps*|

-14-

cast serious doubts on his veracity, and
makes him untrustworthy and unreliable. It
is quite unsafe to rely on testimony of such
witness, even on facts deposed by him other
than those improvements unless it receives
corroboration from some other independent
piece of reliable evidence.17 In the case of
Shahzada vy. Hamidullah,18 a five-member
Bench of this Court, on appraising the
evidence of a witness, found that he had
improved upon the version he had earlier
given to the police while making statement in
Court, and upon such finding held that the
improvement had affected his veracity
rendering it unsafe to rely upon his evidence.
Hamoodur Rahman, J., speaking for the
Bench observed: "[The witness] also tried to
improve upon the version he earlier gave to
the police by introducing the story of his
having seen the [accused] respondent
Hamidullah actually loading his gun in the
middle of the bazar. In his police statement
he had only stated that when he saw
Hamidullah first he appeared to be
proceeding to the shop of the deceased to
purchase snuff. This definite attempt at
embellishment clearly affected his veracity
and rendered it unsafe to rely upon his
evidence." In the case of Akhtar Ali v.
Statel9 the complaint initially made
statement that four unknown persons had
committed the offence and did not name any
person therein, but subsequently nominated
the accused persons in his supplementary
statement despite the fact that one of the
accused person was already known to him. A
four-member Bench of this Court, which
heard the case, noted with concern that
improvement made by the complaint even
during investigation and discarded his
testimony making the observations that
"when a witness improves his version to
strengthen the prosecution case, his improved
statement subsequently made cannot be
relied upon as the witness has improved his
statement dishonestly, therefore, his
credibility becomes doubtful."

Even both the eye-witnesses have belied
their claim with regard to companionship of Mst.
Sophia, mother of deceased, with them at the
relevant time by admitting in cross-examination that
Mst. Sophia was ill and she could not walk. Though
the complainant has tried to rectify the said mistake
of her tongue by stating that Mst. Sophia was going
to consult a doctor but that is not at all the version of
prosecution because both the eye-witnesses have
stuck only to their stance that they were
accompanying the deceased to see him off. Another
striking fact on record which casts a doubt on
presence of the two ladies on crime scence is that the
I.O has examined them u/s 161, Cr.P.C on the
following day of the occurrence though the
statements u/s 161, Cr.P.C of daughters and
daughter-in-law of deceased Mst. Zarkhewa were
recorded on the day of occurrence. Prosecution has
not explained that what were those unfavorable
circumstances that precluded the I.O to record

statements of the eye-witnesses on the same day.

iil. According to FIR, the occurrence took
place at 09:00 A.M but the report was lodged at
11:00 A.M with delay of two hours. Even the said

entries in the FIR appear to be fictitious because

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim.
Hon’ble Mr. figar Ahm:
Tajamul/Ps*|

= [6%

Sher Zada (PW-9), who has seconded the report of
complainant, admitted in his cross-examination that
he had reached the spot at 08:15 A.M and on his
arrival police were already present on the spot. It
appears that the occurrence had taken place at least
before 07:00 A.M and this fact can be confirmed
from the contents of the FIR wherein the
complainant stated that they had set off early in the
morning. The term ‘early in the morning’ generally
denotes the time before sunrise. The date of
occurrence is 05.03.2019 and the time of sunrise in
this area as per calendar is 06:35 A.M. Statement of
PW Sher Zada clearly shows that on his arrival to
spot at 08:15 A.M police were already present on the
spot meaning thereby that real facts of the
occurrence have been suppressed by prosecution.
The mentioned circumstances on record suggest that
police had deliberately delayed lodging of the report
to procure the attendance of eye-witnesses. Had the
eye-witnesses accompanied the deceased upto the
spot, police would have recorded the report at least
at 08:00 A.M but it appears that they had deferred
recording of the report till arrival of the females to
the spot at 11:00 A.M. Thus, preliminary

investigation was conducted in the matter and

SB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Tajamul/Ps*

-17-
relatives of the deceased charged the present
appellants for the murder after deliberation and
consultation as is evident from clear cut admission
of PW Sher Zada that from 08:15 till 11:30 A.M
they consulted each other for charging the accused.
The factum regarding preliminary investigation and
procurement of the eye-witnesses can further be
confirmed from the fact that even post-mortems on
the dead bodies were delayed till 04:00/04:30 P.M
on the same day otherwise there was no reason for
such belated examination of the dead bodies by the
doctor at civil hospital Puran where the P.S is also
situated at a distance of only 7/8 kilometers from the
spot which can be covered within half an hour.
Wisdom in this regard may be derived from
“Tftikhar Hussain and others Vs. The State” (2004
SCMR 1185) wherein the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan has observed that.

“4+ it is a case in which F.I.R. has been
registered after consultation and conducting
preliminary investigation. If both these
witnesses in fact had witnessed the incident,
there was no occasion to cause delay in
lodging of F.LR. It is significant to note that
delay in lodging F.I.R. under section 154,
Cr.P.C. is condonable keeping in view the
facts and circumstances of each case
particularly in those cases where the accused
persons have not been nominated in the F.I.R.
and the names of the witnesses who have seen

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/es*|

-18-

the incident have also not been mentioned but
where the complainant is fully aware about
the culprits and the names of the witnesses are
also known to him then if delay in lodging
F.LR. is caused, it creates heavy duty upon the
prosecution to explain the same satisfactorily
otherwise the prosecution case would become
doubtful......”.

12. Not only there is perceptible disparity
in the prosecution case with regard to the place of
first occurrence but the version of prosecution that
the appellants had committed murder of deceased
Shamsher Khan right in front of their house after
pre-planning also pricks our mind. As per site-plan
Ex.PB, the spot of first occurrence is thoroughfare
passing in front of the houses of the present
appellants. The four-corners of the said spot have

been mentioned in the site plan as under:

North-west: Houses of appellants
South-west: Land of appellants
East-north: Houses of Gul Sharif
and Gul Nawab Shah
West-north: Land of Sahib Shah

The I.O has not shown any stream (354)
in the site plan and it appears that the pathway on
which the occurrence took place, is leading towards
a stream as the words 354 45) ~usl) have been
mentioned in the site plan. From careful perusal of

the statements of PWs, we have reached to the

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim.
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-19-

conclusion that a stream was intervening between
the spot of occurrence and houses of the appellants
but the site plan is mute regarding existence of
stream in-between the houses of appellants and the
first crime post. In this regard the relevant
statements of the PWs are worth perusal, which are

reproduced below for the sake ofconvenience.

“Distance between village Sorgah Cham
(village of deceased) and Hasham Khel Dabb
(spot of first occurrence) is about 30 minutes by
walk. Main road is situated from village Sorgah
cham at the distance of 30 minutes. It is correct
that_while leading towards main road from
Sorgah Cham, there is khwar in-between _the
house _of _accused__and__ thoroughfare.

Thoroughfare is at the distance of two minutes
from houses of accused” (the words in brackets

added and underlined supplied for emphasis)

Although PW Mst. Saina has denied the
suggestion of defence counsel with regard to
existence of Khwar/stream in-between the spot and
house of appellants but admitted in her cross-

examination that:

Except the thoroughfare, there is no other way
leading to main road. Distance between place of
occurrence _and_ house of accused is about 10
minutes.

From bare perusal of the above extracts
from the statements of eye-witnesses, one thing is
abundantly clear that the walking distance between

the place of first occurrence and house of accused

$8: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/es*|

#90
ranges from 02 to 10 minutes as per independent
analysis of the eye witnesses. Even if the minimum
time i.e 02 minutes (120 seconds) is considered for
covering the said distance between the first spot and
house of accused, the result so appearing is shocking
because a person while walking with slowest speed
of taking one step per second can easily take 120
steps in the equal number of seconds. In light of the
statements of the eye-witnesses, the place of first
occurrence is doubtful because the same has been
shown adjacent to the house of appellants in the site
plan. This situation suggests concealment of real
facts of the occurrence on the part of prosecution for
the purpose of showing nexus of the present
appellants with the murder of deceased Shamsher
Khan. The disparity between the ocular account and
site plan creates a reasonable doubt in prudent mind,
hence, the story narrated in the FIR cannot be

believed.

Even otherwise, the version of
prosecution does not stand to reason that the
appellants, after consultation and deliberation,
attacked the deceased right in front of their house
and killed him for the sake of their honour.

Admittedly, the villages of both the parties are

SB: Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
|
Tajamul/PS*)

25s
situated in mountainous area where the
thoroughfares generally pass through ravens and
secluded spots. If the appellants had the intention to
kill the deceased for satisfaction of their anger and
revenge, they would have never chosen the front
area of their house for committing his murder rather
they would have done away with him at some other

isolated place.

13. The second occurrence, wherein Mst.
Zarkhewa was done to death, has remained un-
witnessed because prosecution has not produced any
eye-witness to establish involvement of appellant
Ahmad Shah with the said murder which was
attributed to him by prosecution. Though Mst.
Sakina Bibi, who is daughter-in-law of the female
deceased, was examined as PW-14 but she was
declared as hostile witness on the request of learned
DPP. During her cross-examination, she was only
confronted with her statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C and
nothing material could be brought from her on
record to establish that the assailant was appellant
Ahmad Shah. Postmortem though shows that the
female deceased had met an unnatural death due to

firearm injuries, however, the said evidence alone is

$8: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*|

2 9y-=
not sufficient to prove that the firearm injuries were
caused to deceased Mst. Zarkhewa by her
husband/appellant Ahmad Shah. The remaining
corroborative evidence in shape of recovery of blood
and crime empty, in view of its doubtful nature, is of
no avail to prosecution in absence of direct evidence.
Thus, prosecution has badly failed to prove the

charge of murder against appellant Ahmad Shah.

14. Adverting to circumstantial evidence on
record, medical evidence is in conflict with ocular
account for the reason that complainant in her
examination-in-chief has attributed two effective fire
shots upon deceased Shamsher Khan to appellant
Muhammad Zahir Shah while appellant Ahmad
Shah was assigned only one fire shot thereby
causing injury on the right side chest of the said
deceased. But according to medical report Ex.PM of
deceased Shamsher Khan, the doctor has observed
three inlet wounds all of 1/2 inch in size. It is the
version of prosecution that appellant Muhammad
Zahir Shah was armed with 30-bore pistol while
appellant Ahmad Shah had fired at the deceased

with 9 MM pistol. Definitely, fire shots with two

iu Ir

-93
pistols of different bores would have caused entry
wounds of different dimensions on the deceased but
the situation here in this case is different. In
response to a question by defence counsel, Dr. Imran
Khan (PW-5), who had examined deceased
Shamsher Khan, stated that similar characteristics of
wounds suggest firing from one and the same
weapon. Thus, the entry wounds of same size on the
dead body of deceased Shamsher Khan suggest that
it was one man job but the charge was exaggerated
by complainant by implicating two persons in the
case, however, it cannot be determined from the
evidence on record that which one of the two
appellants had killed deceased Shamsher Khan.
Moreso, Lady doctor Najma Begum (PW-2) has
reported two entry wounds both of 1.5 cm in size
which do not tally with the size of inlet wounds on
the dead body of Shamsher Khan. Wisdom may be
drawn from judgment of the august Supreme Court

in the case of “Farman Ali and 03 others Vs. The

State” (PLD 1980 Supreme Court 201), wherein it

was held that:

"In his dying declaration, Rashid Khan has
involved the three brothers as well as their friend,

SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
Sig)

Farman Ali. But the medical evidence and the
evidence of the Ballistic Expert do seem to cast
doubt on his veracity. The evidence of Doctor
Muhammad Kamal, who had conducted autopsy
on the dead body of Rashid Khan is that the size
of inlet of all the wounds suffered by him was the
same meaning thereby that he had been shot from
one or more than one weapon of the same calibre.
It is in the evidence of the Ballistic Expert,
however, that the four empties sent to him for
examination were found to have been fired
through .32 bore pistol which was also sent to him
by the Investigation Officer. It would therefore
follow that Rashid Khan had been shot through a
pistol and certainly not through a rifle with which
Farman Ali is said to have been armed. It is true
that according to the prosecution each one of the
three appellant brothers was armed with a .32
bore pistol. But the type of injuries suffered by
Rashid Khan rather suggest that it was the work
of one man. It is common knowledge that .32 bore
pistol is an automatic weapon carrying in its
charger seven bullets. The fact that the deceased
was found to have suffered seven inlet wounds,
three of them in his left Knee joint, one on his left
elbow, two in his abdomen and one in backward
direction to his right superior iliac spine, the inlet
-size of all of which is said to be the same, would
go a long way to show that this could as well be
the work of a single person and not of the three
appellants. There is no evidence on the record to
show, however, as to which one of the three had
caused him the said injuries, therefore, no option
is left but to hold that the prosecution has failed
to bring home its case against any one of the
appellants".

The Investigating Officer has visited the
spot on 05.03.2019, the day of occurrence,
alongwith police constables and allegedly recovered
crime empties and blood from the two spots.
Prosecution has examined Tahir Shah ASI as PW-3,

who is marginal witness of different recovery

memos including Ex.PC and Ex.PC/1. According to
Ex.PC, the I.O has recovered 05 empties of 30-bore
pistol from the first spot, which were attributed to
appellant Muhammad Zahir Shah while a single
empty of 9 MM bore pistol was recovered from the
spot allegedly fired by appellant Ahmad Shah. As
per Ex.PC/1, one empty and one live round of 9 MM
bore pistol were recovered from the second spot and
the same have been attributed to appellant Ahmad
Shah. Similarly, constable Muhammad Ayaz was
examined as PW-4 who is one of the attesting
witnesses of recovery memos Ex.PC/4 and Ex.PC/5
vide which blood-stained earth was recovered from
the first spot while blood-stained earth/grass and
sickle were recovered from the second spot. It is not
the stance of prosecution that I.O had recovered the
blood and crime empties from the spots during
different visits at different times on the same date
rather the Investigating Officer (PW-13) has

admitted it in clear terms that:

Beside me Tahir Shah ASI, constable
Muhammad Ayaz and other private persons

were present........ At the time of recovery of
empties Muhammad Ayaz constable was also
present.

Thus, in light of the evidence on record,

the aforesaid marginal witnesses namely Tahir Shah

06's
ASI (PW-3) and Constable Muhammad Ayaz (PW-
4) were present on the spots at the time of recovery
of blood-stained earth/grass and crime empties but
PW Muhammad Ayaz has denied recovery of
empties from any spot. He stated in his cross-

examination that:

When the I.O was inspecting the spot in my
presence, no empties were recovered, as I am
not witness to that recovery....... When I
reached to place where allegedly female
deceased was murdered, empties were not
recovered in my presence.

It is evident from the above statement of
PW Muhammad Ayaz that no empty was recovered
by I.0 from both the spots in his presence though he
was present there at the relevant times alongwith I.O
and Tahir Shah ASI, the witness of recovery of
empties. A particular fact which is asserted by one
witness but denied by another cannot be accepted in
evidence provided presence of both the witnesses at
the same place and time with regard to that
particular fact is established on record
notwithstanding they were formally shown as
witnesses of different facts or posted as attesting
witnesses of different recovery memos regarding
different articles recovered from the same crime

spot. The mentioned state of affairs tends us to

Tajamut/ps*|

-'27 =

conclude that actually no empties were recovered by
police from both the spots otherwise PW
Muhammad Ayaz constable would have verified the
said factum during his cross-examination. Same is
the doubtful status of recovery of crime weapons on
pointation of both the appellants. Admittedly, the
I.O had raided the houses of appellants on
05.03.2019 for the purpose of their arrest and
recovery of crime weapons but no weapon was
recovered from their houses on the same date. The
recovery of 30-bore pistol has been shown from
fodder-husk spread over the goat-yard inside the
house of appellant Muhammad Zahir Shah whereas
9 MM pistol was allegedly recovered on pointation
of appellant Ahmad Shah from the top of cupboard
in veranda of his house. Prosecution has not
explained that why the pistols were not recovered
from the mentioned places inside the houses of
appellants during the first raid of police on their
houses on the day of occurrence. The matching FSL
reports Ex.PK and Ex.PK/2 are of no avail to
prosecution in view of the doubtful recoveries of
crime empties and crime weapons. In addition to
above, the parcels containing empties were handed

over to constable Muhammad Ayaz (PW-4) on

ORs

10.03.2019 but he delivered the same in the forensic
lab on 13.03.2019. He has not explained that for
what purpose he had retained the empties with him
for several days, hence, manipulation of the crime
empties cannot be ruled out in the circumstances.
Corroborative recoveries of such doubtful nature

cannot be relied upon against the appellants.

15. Although appellant Ahmad Shah has
recorded his confessional statement before the
Judicial Magistrate (PW-6) but the said confession
on the face of it neither appears to be true and
voluntary nor inspires confidence enough to base
conviction of the appellants. The confessional
statement is reproduced below of the sake of

convenience.

It has been suggested to Investigating

Officer as well as Judicial Magistrate that confession

of the appellant was almost verbatim copy of his

statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C. The I.O stated in his

cross-examination that:

Statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C and confessional
statement of accused u/s 164, Cr.P.C are
almost same.

Likewise, the Judicial Magistrate also

did not disprove the said fact by stating that:

SB:

Before recording confessional statement of
accused I had gone through Judicial file and at
that time statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C of accused
was part of police file. It is correct that
statement of accused recorded u/s 161, Cr.P.C
recorded by police and confessional statement

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justi Ahm
Tajamul/Ps+|

30m

of accused recorded u/s 164/364, Cr.P.C are
ditto copy of each other.

We have gone through the statement of
appellant u/s 161, Cr.P.C. It appears that while
recording confessional statement of appellant, the
words of his statement 161, Cr.P.C were moved
back and forth by reproducing events of the story
almost in the same order. Keeping in view the afore-
referred doubtful position of the confessional
statement, we do not think it safe to consider it

against the appellants.

16. Keeping in view the alleged
background of the motive, doubtful statements of the
PWs, visible conflict between the ocular account and
medical evidence which is suggestive of exaggerated
charge and false implication of the appellants,
murder of deceased Shamsher Khan nearby the
houses of appellants, preliminary investigation in the
case and unconvincing confessional statement of
appellant Ahmad Shah, we have come to the
irresistible conclusion that the occurrence has not
taken place in the mode and manner as alleged by
prosecution and depicted by complainant in the FIR.

The mentioned aspects of the case create various

‘SB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim

31.
reasonable doubts in prudent mind regarding guilt of
the appellants and they deserve to get the benefit
thereof as per well-established principle of criminal
justice. While deciding the appeal titled ‘State
through PG Sindh_and_ others Vs. Ahmed Omar
Sheikh and others’ reported as 2021 SCMR 873, the

august Supreme Court observed that:

In this case, regarding each and every piece of
evidence the doubts are emerging from the mouth
of the witnesses, and it is settled since centuries
that benefit of doubt automatically goes in favour
of an accused. Even if a single circumstance
create reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
regarding guilt of an accused then the accused
shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right and
such benefit must be extended to the accused
person(s) by the Courts without any reservation.

17. After due consideration, we are of the
opinion that prosecution has badly failed to prove
the charge against the present appellants beyond
shadow of reasonable doubt, therefore, their
conviction and sentences recorded by learned trial
Court cannot be sustained in the circumstances.
Resultantly, this appeal is allowed, the impugned
judgment is set aside and appellants Muhammad

Zahir Shah and Ahmad Shah are acquitted of the

charge in the present case. They be released

forthwith from jail if not required in any other case.
