1. This criminal appeal was preferred by
Amane Rum (the appellant) against the judgment of
the Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi/
Judge Child Protection and Juvenile Court, Swat,
dated 23.09.2020, whereby he was convicted and

sentenced as under:

“52. [...] Under section 376(3),

53. Since, victim child has suffered
mental & physical anguish thus,
compensatory fine amounting to
Rs.100,000/- is awarded to victim
u/s.544-A Cr.P.C to be payable in
form of saving certificates to her
upon attainment of age of majority.
The compensation is to be payable
by convict Aman-e-Rome s/o Bakht
Rome, r/o Chalis Palaw, Charbagh,
District Swat. Failing to pay same
the amount will be recovered as
arrears of land revenue from the
convict Aman-e-Rome s/o Bakht
Rome, r/o Chalis Palaw, Charbagh,
District Swat”.

2. On 07.07.2017 at 17:00 hours,
Tanveer Ali, a resident of Dando-Palao, took his
minor daughter Ms. Samreena Bibi, aged about 6/7
years, to the Police Station Charbagh, where he

reported the incident of the rape of his daughter.

YN

The germane facts of the incident are that on the
eventful day, at 12:20 Noon, Ms Samreena while
weeping came home. On query, she informed that
after getting snacks(4) from a shopkeeper
Jehanzeb while on the way back to her home, the
accused Aman-e- Rum forcibly took her inside a
cattle-shed, where he tried to take off her clothes and
sexually abuse her. On her screaming, the accused

left her there and fled away. Dr. Uzma, a Medical

Officer examined the victim and found that the
victim was raped. The case was registered against
the appellant vide FIR No.371, dated 07.07.2017
ws. 376, PPC and section 53 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare

Act, 2010, at the Police Station Charbagh.

3. It is worth mentioning that during the
course of investigation, the appellant recorded his
confessional statement before the Judicial
Magistrate. On the completion of investigation,
challan was put in court against the appellant/
convict before the trial Court. Copies were supplied
to him in compliance of section 265-C, Cr.PC.
Charge was farmed against him u/s.376, PPC, read
with section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010, to which,

he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution examined as many as
eleven (11) PWs. The appellant/convict was
examined u/s. 342, Cr.PC, in which, he was afforded
an opportunity of producing evidence in defence
and/or recording statements on oath. He produced
one Najibullah, Muharrir/SI, Police Lines Kabal,

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAL

as DWI, in his defence. DW1 produced a copy of

DD No.15 dated 03.07.2017 and also exhibited an
extract of the DD register as Ex:DWI1/1. The
appellant was also reexamined u/s.342, Cr.P.C.,

after recording the statement of his witness as DW1.

5. On conclusion of trial proceedings and
hearing arguments of DPP for the State assisted by
counsel for the complainant and counsel for the
appellant/convict, the trial Court vide impugned
judgment passed on 23.09.2020, convicted the

appellant by awarding him the sentence mentioned

above.

6. Arguments of counsel for both the
parties as well as Asst: A.G for the State, heard and

record gone through.

7. We shall begin with the ocular
account furnished by Ms. Samreen (victim PW12),
Tanveer Ali Khan (father of the victim/complainant
PWI10), and Tawgeer (her uncle PW8). A close
reading of the statements of these PWs would
transpire that on 07.07.2012, the victim entered her
house at the relevant time. She was weeping.

On being asked by her father (PW10), she replied

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (D.B) HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEFEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-5-

that after purchasing Papar (%) from a shop, on her

way back home, the appellant took hold of her hand,
took her to cattle shed (Ghojal), where he tried to
strip her naked in order to molest her modesty but
when she raised hue and cry, he ran away from the
seen. He took her alongwith her blood stained
Shalwar (trouser) to the Police Station, Charbagh,
where he lodged the report. He was then
accompanied by police personnel, including a lady
constable, to the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital in
Khwazakhela. The victim was medically examined.
After receipt of the medical report, it was found that
the appellant was raped the victim, for which he
charged him. Then, he, in the presence of the victim,
showed the crime scene to the Investigating Officer,
who prepared the site plan of the crime scene. On
08.07.2017, the next day, he recorded a statement

before the IO.

8. While under cross examination,
PW10 was asked several questions, key amongst
them, related to consultation with others regarding
registration of the case, the time he and the victim
alongwith the police personal reached to the

hospital at the exact time of the victim’s medical

examination; his non-association with proceedings
conducted by the police; the presence of his brother
Tawgeer Ali (PW8) in the village on the day of the
incident, the identity of the appellant and the person
to whom he had handed over the clothes of the
victim. He replied that he made consultation with
his relatives which caused delay in lodging the
report. He, however, explained that in such like
cases, where the honour and dignity of the entire
family is at stake, that was necessary. He explained
that there were blood spots on the shalwar of the
victim. He could not recollect the exact time of the
arrival and the medical examination of the victim in
the hospital, for which, the explanation he offered
was that sufficient time had passed so he could not
tell the time with precise details. He further
explained that it was sufficient time before the
Maghrib Azan. The question about one Jehanzeb
shopkeeper appears to be irrelevant as he did not
mention him in his examination-in-chief. Then, he
confirmed that his brother Tawqeer Ali (PW8), who
had last seen the victim and the appellant shortly
before the incident was present in the village on the

day of the incident. Next, he identified the appellant,

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL
-7-
stating that he belongs to his village though not his

relative. He further stated that he handed over the
garments of the victim to the police and not to the
doctor. He denied various suggestions, such as, his
explanation about consultation with his relatives
was an attempt to give false evidence and thereby
mislead the Court. He denied that there were no
blood stains on the Shalwar which the victim was
wearing at the time of the occurrence. He also
denied that he charged the appellant after having
identified him. He denied that his statement was
false and that he withheld the best available
evidence. He also denied that he charged the

appellant on the basis of ill-will.

9. The victim, being a minor girl of 09
years, was first subjected to rationality test by the
trial Court. As many as 09 questions were asked
from her. The questions were related to her name,
the class in which she read, her friends, her father
name, her age, the place where she was present (the
court-room), the name of her school, the purpose for
which she appeared before the Court and the counsel
who was representing her. She successfully replied

all the questions, including most particularly, giving

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.B) HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Br, KHURSHID IOBAL
-8-

evidence as the purpose of her presence in the Court.
After having passed the rationality test, the trial
Court expressed its satisfaction that she was able to
hear and understand the questions put to her and she
was capable to answer the questions. Thereafter,
she recorded the following statement as her

examination-in-chief:

“Stated that on the day of
occurrence I had gone to shop
where I had purchased some
snacks. I came back to the water
pump and stand there. The accused
asked me to press handle for
releasing water. I pressed the pump
then the accused kissed me on
cheek. Thereafter, the accused told
me to come after him and he took
me to cattle shed. Inside the cattle
shed the accused striped me off my
shalwar and laid down me on a
sack. Then he stripped off his
shalwar as well. Then he started
moving to and fro while laying
above me. I started crying, accused
. told me that he will give rupees 10
more if I stop crying. I was bleed
and I was crying and weeping due
to pain. Then, I went to my home. I
informed my grandmother and
mother about the occurrence.
Then, later on we went to police
Station for report. Thereafter,
police took me to hospital for
medical examination. We also
pointed out the place of occurrence
to police. (Today, the pictures
available on case file Ex: PW11/3
were shown to the witness

“Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON'BLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAB
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or. KHURSHID [OBAL
-9-
regarding the pointation of place of
occurrence to police which she
verified) I charge accused facing
trial for commission of offence.
(subject to objection of the defense
counsel that the witness has been
tutored by her parents; neither her
statement was record u/s.161
Cr.P.C nor her name was
mentioned in the calendar of
witnesses).”
10. While under cross examination, the
victim correctly replied that her place of residence
is called Dando-Palao Charbagh; that she was
studying in Class-I in the Qaid-e-Azam Public
School. She was cross examined about her close
relatives, including the one whom she loves most.
While answering these questions, she said that the
one whom she loves the most is her grandmother.
She then stated that if she disobeys her grandmother,
the latter gets angry with her. She was then asked if
it was correct that her father and grandmother told
her to give evidence in the Court. She stated that it
was correct. However, she termed it incorrect that
her grandmother threatened here and warned her for
dire consequences if she did not record her evidence
according to her instructions. Next, she termed it

correct that her grandmother had told her that if she

recorded her statement according to her saying,

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (D.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR, FUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID [OBAL
EN

-10-

she would reward her. Quite interestingly, she
denied the next suggestion that being a minor girl
she was a tutored witness. Counsel for the appellant
vehemently stressed on this aspect of her cross
examination, saying that the victim was tutored and
even intimidated by her father and grandmother. We
are not persuaded with his arguments. The main
reason is that while evaluating evidence, the
statement of a witness has to be seen as a whole,
there could be no cherry picking of bits and pieces
of a statement that could be given weight in favour
of one party. In other words, the Court is required to
read the evidence in toto and weigh it palpably not
only in itself but also in tandem with other evidence,
oral as well as documentary, in the whole spectrum
of the facts and circumstances of the case.
While we are conscious of the fact that the defence
has a right to shatter the prosecution case in cross
examination by putting a vast array of question to a
witness, particularly the star witness of the
prosecution, such as, the victim in the case in hand,
we observe that the learned defence counsel
endeavoured to establish that the witness was under
the influence or duress of her father and/or

grandmother. The victim was first asked as to whom

Bakht Sher All Khan/Stenographer* (DB) HON! R. JUSTIC! MM AD NAEE!
PBLE Mi 7
-ll-

she loves first. The answer she furnished was that it
was her grandmother. A still closer analysis of the
cross examination would clearly manifest that the
defence was not successful in showing that the
statement of the victim was prompted by influence
or duress and not confidence inspiring. In this
respect, her examination-in-chief reproduced above
appears to be categorical in spelling out the event in
all its natural details. More importantly, the victim
remained firm and steadfast during her cross

examination where she said:

“The person who took me to the
cattle shed from the hand pump, I
know him and his name is Aman-e-
Room (accused).”
11. The mere fact that the victim admitted
that her father and grandmother told her to record
her statement, by no stretch of imagination, means
that she was told what evidence she was to give in
the Court. She, as discussed above, denied from
having been threatened or warned by her
grandmother. Similarly, the mere fact that she
admitted having been told by her grandmother that

she would be rewarded for giving evidence in the

Court, also in no way suggest, that she was tutored.

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or, KHURSHID IOBAL

-12-

Indeed, a grandmother is a grandmother and we all
love her and we love to obey her; we always listen
to her; we do our best to obey her, and in the given
circumstances, there is nothing wrong if the victim
was told by the grandmother to give evidence in the
Court. The victim has given the evidence which is
evidence in fact and not something extraneous or
something that her grandmother told her to state in
her evidence. We are at loss to find something that
may provide leverage to the defence. Moreover, the
grandmother issue referred to above even if ignored
for the sake of arguments, the statement of the
victim needs to be seen whether it is corroborated

by the rest of the evidence.

12. The evidence of her uncle Tawgeer Ali
(PW$8), was that the victim was drinking water from
the hand pump, situated near the road of village
Dando-Palao, Sher Alam hujra, where the appellant
Amane Rum son of Bakht Rum r/o Chalis-Palao was
also standing. At that time, he himself was on the
way towards a water channel situated in village
Pampal. He asked the victim to go straight to her
home. After some time, when he himself returned
home, he learnt that the appellant had raped the
victim.

Bakht Sher All Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON'DLE MR, JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
-13-

13. Coming to the cross examination of
PW8 (uncle of the victim), we see that he was not
given a tough time during cross examination.
He fully restated in his cross examination that he
had seen the victim and the appellant near the water
hand pump at about 12:00 noon, a short time before
the incident. He recollected that even in his police
statement he had deposed that he had seen the
appellant standing near the water pump. It is for the
reason that his admission that the police recorded his
statement after four days of the occurrence, is not
helpful to the defence. He denied that he was not
present in District Swat at the time of the
occurrence. He also denied that he recorded his
statement before the police after consultation and

deliberation about his nomination in the case.

14, We will now proceed to the medical
evidence furnished by Dr. Uzma as PW7. She
examined the victim at 06:50 PM on 07.07.2017,
the day the incident occurred. She recorded her
observations that at the time of her examination, the
victim was conscious and she was weeping due to

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON! USTICE MUHAMM EM
HON’BLE MR, IUSTICE Or. KHURSHID IOBAL
-14-
sever vaginal pain. She recorded the following
findings:

“Following are my findings:

1. Small laceration/tear on the
upper part of vagina all around
noted. Fresh bleeding noted.

2. On speculum examination/pre
vaginal examination hymen was
ruptured fresh active bleeding
noted due to forceful penetration/
entry.

3. Signs of recent rupture of
hymen, laceration, erythema and
vaginal walls are edematous, &
hemorrhage from vaginal walls are
also noted.

Gait normal.

Opinion: At this stage/time, in my

opinion, recent forceful intercourse

done with victim.”
15. The above findings leave no doubt
whatsoever that the victim was raped. While under
cross examination she admitted that lady constable
Nahid produced before her the victim in the labour
room in the hospital where entry of men is
forbidden. The aforesaid lady constable Nahid was
examined as PW1. She furnished evidence of the
fact that she took the victim before Dr. Uzma, who
examined her at 06:30 pm (sham-vela), in her

presence. Though PW1 stated that the ILO and

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
ION’ [io Al
other police officials were also present there, but
Dr. Uzma clarified that inside the labour room,
where she conducted the examination, no male
person was present. However, she expressed her
lack of knowledge about standing of other persons

outside the labour room or not. She was asked about

16. Next, she was asked about semen

stains on the Shalwar of the victim. She further
stated that semen stains could not be determined
normally, so for proper determination, they are
required to be examined in the FSL and it was for
that reason that she forwarded the same to the FSL.
She restated that her opinion was clear inasmuch as
the victim was recently subjected to forceful
intercourse. She denied a suggestion that she could
not herself determine whether sexual intercourse
was committed with the victim or not, so she sent
the semen stains to the FSL. She then explained on
her that she sent the semen stains to FSL for further

confirmation of her opinion.

17. The next most important piece of
prosecution evidence is the confessional statement
of the appellant, which was recorded by
Mr. Issa Khan Afridi, the Judicial Magistrate,

on 12.07.20217. The questionnaire, the certificate

Bakke Sher Ati Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MB. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IOBAL

-17-

and the confessional statement coupled with the
deposition of the Judicial Magistrate demonstrate
that when the appellant was produced before him,
he introduced himself as Judicial Magistrate first
class and informed him that he needs to understand
that he is not bound to make a confession and, if he
made so, the same will be used against him as
evidence. When asked as to why he wants to make
a confession, the appellant replied that he has
committed the offence. He satisfactorily answered
before the Judicial Magistrate that he was making
confession on his own free will, without compulsion
of any body and further that he was neither
threatened nor was induced nor was he told that he
would be made an approver. He stated having
remained in police custody for three days. He
declined to meet with his counsel or relatives. The
certificate appended to the statement reflects that he
was produced at 12:30 hours and was given two
hours to think about his decision to make his
confession. The certificate further shows that the
appellant gave his statement in Pashto, which the
Judicial Magistrate translated into Urdu and then

read it over to him and that he admitted the same as

Buklit Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. IUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MP. JUSTICE Dr. HHURSHID JOBAL
-18-

correct, which he finally signed and thumb
impressed. The confessional statement was certified

u/s. 364, Cr.P.C.

18. While under cross examination, the
Judicial Magistrate stated that he did not explain to
him the difference between Police Station and Jail.
However, he explained that the appellant was a
police official, suggesting that it was not required.
He deposed that during the process of recording the
confession, he kept explaining and making the
appellant understand each and every question of the
questionnaire which he would reduce into writing
what he would say himself. He denied a suggestion
that it was a mistake on his part that he did not give
a second opportunity to the appellant to think about
his confessional statement. He also explained that
after completion of recording the confessional
statement, he handed over the appellant to the
Naib Court. He testified that in the printed
questionnaire he has recorded the answers of the
appellant in his own handwriting. On a question

about torture, he replied that apparently there were

Bakht Sher Ali KhanfStenographer* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID LOBAL
-19-

no signs of violence on his body; and that he
apparently looked normal. However, he added that
he noted from appellant’s face reading that he was
embarrassed and unhappy for having committed the
offence. In light of the above analysis of the
evidence, we find no anomaly in the process
followed by the Judicial Magistrate while recording

the confessional statement of the appellant.

19. Learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently argued that constable Babar Ali
No.2446 (PW3), who deposed that during the police
custody, no one else except the Investigating Officer
subjected the appellant to torture. He invited
our attention to the proceedings at the trial
on 19.02.2018 (vide order No.11), when private
counsel for the complainant submitted an
application to declare the aforesaid constable
Babar Ali as a hostile witness. A copy of the
application is available on page 161 of this appeal.
The reasons shown in the application was that the
private counsel for the complainant went out of the

Court during break for offering prayer. When he

Bakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KRURSHID IQBAL

-20-

came back to the Court, he found that the cross
examination of the PW3 was completed. On that
date of the hearing, while the proceedings were
adjourned, when the private counsel for the
complainant perused the statement of PW3, he
found that the witness had given a concessional
statement in his cross examination. The trial Court,
vide its order No.7 dated 30.05.2018, decide
the issue in such a way that the witness was
ordered to be cross examined again. Thus, the cross
examination was conducted on 28.11.2018,
in which, he resiled from his earlier stance,
categorically stating that no violence was committed
on the appellant in his presence. He further stated
that no one was tortured in the Police Station.
Counsel for the appellant could not convince us that
the cross examination has caused prejudice to the
appellant. Indeed, the reason mentioned in the
application was that the defence counsel cross
examined the witness in the absence of the private
counsel for the complainant. There is no explanation
on the part of defence counsel in this regard. The

contention of the appellant in his statement u/s. 342,

Hakht Sher Ali Khan/Stenographer* {D.8) HON" usTic eT M.
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IOBAL
-21-
Cr.P.C., at the tail end of the trial, that he was

subjected to torture during police custody is also of
no legal value. The reason is that never before, at the
time of recording his confessional statement as well

as during the trial, he made any such complaint.

20. The appellant in his statement recorded
u/s.342, Cr.P.C, requested the trial Court that the
D.D of his departure from Kabal Police Line to the
Peshawar, be requisitioned. The D.D was produced
by one Moharrir Najibullah of Police Station Kabal
as DW1. Under cross examination, DW1 stated that
as per the D.D., the appellant was directed to leave
for Peshawar. He expressed his lack of knowledge
as to when exactly he left for Peshawar. He further
stated that there is no record to suggest as to when
he left for Peshawar. He explained that the appellant
was not sent to Peshawar in an official vehicle. The
appellant was again examined w/s.342, Cr.P.C with
reference to the evidence given by DW1. When
asked as to what he wants to say about the D.D
produced by the DW1, he simply stated that he has
no concern with it. He was also asked that if he
wants to produce any other evidence. He replied in

the negative.

21, The conclusion of our above
discussion is that the prosecution has established
beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt that the
appellant raped the victim. Before the incident, he
was seen present at the water hand pump where the
victim was also present. Though the victim didn’t
specifically tell her father the factum of her rape but
that is not fatal to the prosecution case for the
reasons: firstly, the victim couldn’t say it being, too,
young; not able to understand the nature of the
dastardly act of rape. Secondly, the medical
examination categorically established the rape. The
victim passed the rationality test before her
testimony was recorded. She identified the appellant
in the Court at the time of recording her statement.
The defence couldn’t establish that the victim was
tortured or threatened or influenced by the
grandmother Confirmatory questions were put to
the Medical Officer during cross examination,
which further strengthened the prosecution case.
The FSL report of the semen stains was positive.
The appellant recorded his judicial confession,
which was found to have been given voluntarily

reflecting the true version of the incident.

-23-
The defence couldn’t establish the plea of torture,

which was set up at a belated stage. The appellant
was afforded full opportunity to establish his
absence by examining defence evidence. His victim
was a minor girl of 6/7 years whose rest of her life
he has destroyed, creating an indelible stigma on her
honour and on the dignity of her family. By his
grisly act, he violated the victim’s dignity—as a
human being; and more so, as a little innocent
child—which is her constitutionally guaranteed
fundamental right. As a little child, she has yet to
see the dawn of her adulthood to realize her dream
of an enjoyable and peaceful family life. Of great
significance is the vulnerability of a rape victim is
to many possible negative effects, such as, fear,
anxiety, anger, anguish, sadness and confusion.
It may have long term health, physiological and
behavioural effects on a victim. Another unfortunate
aspect is that we have no community and public

support measures for rape victim’s rehabilitation.

22. Consequent upon our above
reappraisal of evidence and discussing legal aspect

of the case, we have come to the conclusion that the

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KAURSHID IOBAL
opfe w/R

prosecution has successfully proved the charge
against the appellant beyond any reasonable
shadow of doubt. The evidence of the prosecution is
direct, solid, cogent and confidence inspiring.
The appellant has recorded judicial confession,
from which he resiled in his statement recorded
u/s.342, Cr.P.C. The same, however, is proved as
voluntary, truthful and corroborated by ocular and
medical evidence. The appellant failed to prove his
departure from Kabal Police Line to Peshawar on
the eventful day. We also find that the trial Court

has properly appraised the evidence on the record.

23. Resultantly, we dismiss the instant
appeal being devoid of merits, maintain the
conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant

by the trial Court vide judgment dated 23.09.2020.
