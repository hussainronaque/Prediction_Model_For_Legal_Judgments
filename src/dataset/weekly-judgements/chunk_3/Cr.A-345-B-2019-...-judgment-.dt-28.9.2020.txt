SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Through this criminal appeal the
appellant has questioned the judgment dated 02.11.2019, passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IfI/Model Criminal Trial Court
(MCTC) Lakki Marwat, where the appellant was awarded death
sentence under section 302(b) P.P.C, on two counts for committing
Qatl-e-Amd, of (1) Yasin Khan son of Gul Rehman and (2)Sahil
Rehman son of Mumtaz Khan, and was also burdened under section
544-A Cr.P.C for an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- (one Million) each as
compensation to the legal heirs of each deceased with further
direction that the amount shall be recovered under section 544-A(2)
CrP.C as arrears of land revenue or he shall undergo six months
simple imprisonment in default. The appellant was further convicted
under section 324 P.P.C as Tazir for attempt to commit Qatl-e-Amd

of Muhammad Riaz and Obaidur Rehman on two counts for five(05)

-2-

years RI. along with fine of Rs.50,000/- (fifty thousand only) or in
default of payment of fine, he shall undergo three months SI. He was
further convicted under section 337- F(i) as Tazir for causing hurt to
Muhammad Riaz and Obaidur Rehman, for one year RI as Tazir (on
two counts), and to pay Daman Rs.5000/- to each of the injured.
Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also extended to the convict.

2. The learned trial Court has also sent Murder reference
No.10-B of 2019, for its confirmation or otherwise.

3. Brief facts of the case, as per contents of the F.I.R are
that on 27.10.2016, at 02:00 hours, the complainant Habibur
Rehman brought the dead-body of his nephew namely Yasin Khan
son of Gul Rehman to the Police Station Tajori, and reported the
matter to the local police, that on the eventful night his co-villager
Rehmatullah son of Majeed Khan had arranged a musical show in an
open field adjacent to his house on the eve of his engagement; that
his nephew Yasin Khan also went to attend the program and he
(complainant) was present in his house, when at 00:30 hours, he
heard the firing shots, got worried and went to the musical show. On
reaching there he found the electricity bulbs were on and many
people were watching the activity; that he also saw his nephew
Yasin at some distance from him, and it was 00:45 hours, when
suddenly (1) Aqal Nawaz, (2) Nek Nawaz alias Shikar (accused
facing trial) (3) Sharif Nawaz all sons of Muhammad Nawaz and (4)
Muhammad Nawaz alias Khany son of Rabnawaz his co-villagers
present there duly armed with Kalashnikovs, stood up and started
firing with their respective weapons on his nephew Yasin with

intention to commit his Qatl-e-Amd, as a result he got hit and fell

-3-

down, whereas all the accused thereafter decamped from the spot.
When he attended his nephew he succumbed to the injuries after
some time; that from the firing of above mentioned accused,
Muhammad Riaz son of Muhammad Khan, Obaidur Rehman son of
Muhammad Nawaz, and Rehmatullah son of Majeed Khan also
sustained injuries while one Sahil Rehman son of Mumtaz Khan r/o
Mir Hazar Khanzad Khel, of Police Station Ghazni Khel area, also
got hit and died on the spot. Motive was shown to be the previous
blood feud between the parties, hence, this case/F.LR.

4, After completion of investigation, the complete challan
against all accused was submitted for proceedings under section 512
Cr.P.C, as they were absconders at that time. Later on accused facing
trial namely Nek Nawaz was arrested from Baluchistan and his
supplementary challan was submitted for trial.

5. Accused was in custody, who appeared and after
fulfilling the requirements under section 265-C, Cr.P.C charge
against him was framed on 21.06.2017, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. Similarly, stamen of search witness (SW-1)
was also recorded, in respect of abscondence of the remaining
accused, and thereafter prosecution was allowed to produce its
evidence which was produced accordingly. On close of prosecution
evidence, the statement of accused was recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein he professed his innocence, however, he did not opt
to be examined on oath as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C,
however, he wished to produce defence and as such two witnesses,

were examined as DW-1 and DW-2. After hearing learned counsel

-4-

for the parties, the learned trial Court convicted the appellant vide
impugned judgment.

6. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith Addl:
Advocate General were heard at length and with their valuable
assistance the record was gone through.

7. It was on 27.10.2016, when the complainant was fast
asleep at his house, woke up on hearing the fire shots from the
musical program arranged by Rehmatullah near his house. The
complainant left his house and reached to the place of incident,
where the musical program was in progress, that in the meanwhile
the accused/appellant along with his absconding co-accused came
forward and started firing at the deceased Yasin, which led to his
death along with one Sahil Rehman and resulted into injuries on the
persons of Muhammad Riaz, Obaidur Rehman and Rehmatullah. On
arrival of the Datsun / Pickup the complainant shifted the dead-body
of deceased Yasin to Police Station Tajori, where the report was
made. After preparation of the injury sheet and inquest report the
dead-body of deceased Sahil Rehman along with the injured reached
to the Police Station and as such after preparation of the inquest
report and injury sheets both the dead-bodies along with injured
were sent to Civil Hospital Tajori, for medical examination of the
injured and post mortem of the deceased, under the escort of Dilawar
Khan FC.

8. It is admitted on record that in the episode three
persons were injured where two lost their lives and the trial Court on
conclusion of the trial convicted the accused/ appellant under section

302(B)P.P.C to death sentence as Tazir. The points for determination

-5-

before this Court are as to whether the presence of the complainant
is established on the spot and as to whether the incident occurred in
the mode and manner.

9. The complainant was examined as PW-06, who stated
that a little earlier to the incident he was fast a sleep in the veranda
of his house, and woke up after hearing the fire shots and also
musical sounds as he knew that his nephew Muhammad Yasin had
gone there, so he out of fear went out and reached to the place where
Rehmatullah had arranged a musical show, to celebrate his
engagement. The complainant stated that he reached to the place of
incident at 12:30 a.m. and found huge gathering of people, some
sitting on the cots, some on the ground whereas some were standing
behind the cots watching the local dance called ‘Athan’, where the
participants were dancing in a big circle, it was at 12:45 a.m. when
the accused/ appellant along with absconding co-accused duly armed
came forward and started firing at the deceased Muhammad Yasin,
who after receiving the firearm injuries fell to the ground. It was
further submitted that with the fire shots of the accused/ assailants
one Sahil Rehman got hit, fell to the ground and three others got
injured. The complainant stated that at the time of incident lights
were glowing where he could see the accused and the deceased at
the time of incident and prior to it. Though the motive was stated to
be blood feud between the parties where brother of the complainant
was murdered leading to a charge against the accused/ assailants and
that the deceased was fell a prey to the same, but the presence of the
complainant raise an eyebrow, that why he was not targeted being

the prime target visible to the assailants as the bulbs were on. The

-6-

complainant is still to answer that why other male members of his
house did not accompany to the spot as on one hand it was pitched
dark and on the other, they had a blood feud. The complainant
admitted that he had five sons where two were serving in FC,
whereas three were present at home and even this is on record that
his other brother namely Rehmatullah was also living in the said
house and were present at the time when the complainant left the
house, but his coming alone tells otherwise and it casts doubt on his
veracity.

10. The place of occurrence was stated to be adjacent to
the house of one Rehmatullah, who had arranged the musical
program and it was an open yard heavily crowded by the villagers
including the people from the neighborhood. The complainant as
well as the injured eye-witnesses admitted that the number of the
people gathered on the spot would be more than 80/90 and it was
further admitted that the dancing ‘Athan’ was in progress in a circle.
It is pertinent to mention that the local ‘Athan’ needs an area of 30 to
40 feet in circle, so that the participants could easily perform the
activities. Keeping in view various places assigned to the assailants
and the deceased along with injured we are surprised to see that how
from their respective places the assailants resorted to indiscriminate
firing and that why the people dancing in circle intervening between
the parties did not receive firearm injuries, as in that eventuality
numerous people should have received injuries, that too when four
persons duly armed with sophisticated weapons were firing. Our
anxiety has increased that when the deceased had left for the musical

show after performing his Isha Prayer, and that when the assailants

-7-

were also present at the place of incident, right from the beginning,
i.e. when the program was not yet started then what precluded the
accused / assailants to kill the deceased soon after reaching to the
place of incident and that what kept them waiting till arrival of the
complainant, the situation tells nothing but that the complainant is a

chance and interested witness.

In case titled “Mst, Sughra Begun and another Vs
aiser Parvez and others” (2015 SCMR 1142), wherein it is held

that:

“14. A chance witness, in legal parlance
is the one who claims that he was present
on the crime spot at the fateful time, albeit,
his presence there was a sheer chance as in
the ordinary course of business, place of
residence and normal course of events, he
was not supposed to be present on the spot
but at a place where he resides, carries on
business or runs day to day life affairs. It is
in this context that the testimony of chance
witness, ordinarily, is not accepted unless
justifiable reasons are shown to establish
his presence at the crime scene at the
relevant time. In normal course, the
presumption under the law would operate
about his absence from the crime spot.
True that in rare cases, the testimony of
chance witness may be relied upon,
provided some convincing explanations
appealing to prudent mind for his presence
on the crime spot are put forth, when the
occurrence took place otherwise, his

testimony would fall within the category of

i
i
I
-8-

suspect evidence and cannot be accepted
without a pinch of salt.”
11 The complainant stated that soon after the incident
efforts were made to arrange a Datsun / Pickup which took 45-
minutes and till then the deceased was lying on the ground. The
deceased was allegedly taken to the Police Station where the
complainant reported the matter to PW-04, and on completion of the
report rest of the injured and deceased Sahil Rehman were brought
to the Police Station. It is pertinent to mention that the scribe i.e.
Zafrullah Khan Inspector penned down the report and prepared the
injury sheet along with inquest report of the deceased Muhammad
Yasin and it was thereafter when the other three injured and
deceased were brought to the Police Station, their injury sheets and
inquest report were prepared. This is astonishing that when the
injured reached to the Police Station and when they were conscious
and were capable to speak, why the report was not verified from
them and as to why none of the injured was put a rider to the report.
We cannot ignore when the complainant stated that he took the
deceased Muhammad Yasin to the hospital where he reported the
matter. The conduct of the scribe went unnatural when on one hand
he did not ask for verification of the report from the injured whereas
on the other he did not include section 324 to the report rather
section 302/34 was mentioned. Had he been a truthful witness he
would have added section 324 P.P.C on arrival of the injured
witnesses to the Police Station. The scribe was examined as PW-04,
where he stated that as the F.I.R was a carbon copy, and while

making entries in the original F.I.R section 302/324/34 were inserted

-9-

but it found missing in the carbon copy, which he later on corrected.
At this juncture we felt the need to consult the original record, and
on consulting we found that section 324 P.P.C was later on inserted,
that too without any initial from the scribe. This particular aspect of
the case casts doubt on veracity of the complainant as well as the
scribe and we are constrained to hold that the deceased Muhammad
Yasin was brought by the villagers to the Police Station where the
injury sheet and inquest report was prepared and that it was on
arrival of the complainant that the report was made. The PW-04,
stated that he scribed the report in the shape of F.I.R whereas rest of
the documents i.e. injury sheets and inquest reports were prepared on
his dictation. This witness could not bring on record as what
inability he had which led him to dictate the documents and even he
could not bring on record that who was the official who drafted these
documents on his dictation.

12. The prosecution witnesses made a conscious attempt to
toe the lines but in their this attempt they went apart and could not
reconcile one another. It is admitted on record that the report was
made at 02:00 a.m. in the Police Station, whereas the dead-bodies
along with the injured reached to the hospital at 03:15 a.m. The
prosecution is yet to explain that why it took 1-hour and 15-minutes
to reach the hospital which lies in a close proximity and that how all
the injured were examined by the doctor at 03:15 a.m. The doctor
was examined as PW-02, who stated that at the time when the
injured were brought to the hospital, he was in his house and it was
after the lapse of 15/20 minutes that he reached and examined the

injuries of the injured to whom his Paramedical staff had already

-10-

provided the first aid. It is pertinent to mention that PW-03, stated
that when he brought the injured to the hospital it was the doctor and
none else, who examined and treated them, this conflict between the
two tells nothing but that the real events were suppressed by the
witnesses. The plea of preliminary investigation is further
strengthened by the fact when the doctor stated that when the injured
were brought to the hospital as per routine he on one side was busy
in their medical examination whereas on the other the police were
busy in preparing the injury sheets. His this statement when placed
in juxtaposition with the statement of PW-04, leads us nowhere that
an attempt was made by the prosecution to make the case success
and that in fact the injured along with dead-bodies were brought
either to the hospital or to the Police Station earlier than arrival of
the complainant. The conduct of the complainant is also worth
perusal, when he stated that soon after lodging the report he left the
hospital, had he been present with the dead-body he would have
definitely accompanied to the hospital. In the column of
identification we find one Zareen along with Rehmatullah as the
identifiers where out of the two PW Zareen was examined as PW-
05, who stated that he received information regarding the incident at
his village and reached to the spot wherefrom he accompanied the
dead-body to the Police Station. We are yet to know that when the
incident occurred in the odd hours of the night, when the
complainant went from his house to the place of occurrence all alone
and that when the relatives and family members were not informed
by the complainant then what brought PW Zareen to the place of

incident along with Rehmatullah who happens to the brother of

-li-

complainant. The cumulative effect of all this leads us nowhere, but
to hold that the incident went unwitnessed and on arrival of the
deceased and injured to the Police Station the complainant along

with the identifiers reached there.

In case titled “Muhammad Ashraf alias Acchu Vs the
State” (2019 SCMR 652), wherein it is held that:

“It is well settled that benefit of slightest

doubt must go to an accused and in a case

where the Court reaches a conclusion that

eye-witnesses were chance witnesses, they

had not witnessed the occurrence and the

prosecution story is concocted by the PWs,

then the case of the accused merits plain

acquittal.”
13. The Investigating Officer visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant blood stained earth was recovered
from respective places of both the deceased along with 56-
empties of 7.62 bore. The Investigating Officer was examined as
PW-09, who stated that he initially visited the spot on
27.10.2016, and recovered blood stained earth but postponed
further proceedings till next morning when on availability of
complainant the site-plan was prepared, whereas the
complainant stated that on the night of occurrence he visited the
spot in the company of the Investigating Officer, as it was pitch
dark, so the spot could not be examined. The variation between
the two further troubles the prosecution case, despite the fact

that the Investigating Officer prepared the site-plan at the

-12-

instance of the complainant but neither the cots were shown in
the site-plan nor the musical instruments and even we find no
mention of the people gathered there at the night of incident. In
the episode we have three injured, Muhammad Riaz, Obaidur
Rehman and Rehmatullah, but surprisingly the statement of the
injured witness Muhammad Riaz was recorded after 40-days of
the incident whereas Obaidur Rehman denied to have recorded
his statement. This is on record that the injured Obaidur Rehman
got discharged from the hospital on 05.11.2016, whereas injured
Muhammad Riaz on 03.11.2016 and despite the fact they were
conscious at the time of their examination by the doctor and
thereafter, but the Investigating Officer did not take the pains to
record their statements, we are further surprised when one of the
injured stated that they were called by the Investigating Officer
to the baithak of Habibur Rehman (complainant), where the
Investigating Officer was present and they were shown the
statement of the complainant, the site-plan along with other
documents and were directed to record their statement in line
with that of the complainant. Such belated statement of the
prosecution witnesses tells nothing that they were prevailed
upon by the complainant to support his charge against the
appellant, when such is the state of affairs, what evidentiary
value the statements of these witnesses have and we have no
other option but to outrightly reject their testimonies. This is on
record that one Rehmatullah who had arranged the musical show
too got injured, who was medically examined and discharged

from the hospital on the day of incident, when the doctor

-13-

declared his injury as simple, but neither the Investigating
Officer recorded his statement nor he was produced as a
prosecution witness to confirm the stance of the complainant
and was abandoned as won over. The said Rehmatullah was the
best witness to unearth the truth and his non production takes us
to hold that he was not ready to support the false charge of the
complainant. Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,

1984 caters for the situation, as is held in case titled “Riaz

Ahmad Vs the State” (2010 SCMR 846), wherein it is held that:

“One of the eye-witnesses Manzoor
Hussain was available in the Court on 29-
7-2002 but the prosecution did not
examine him, declaring him as
unnecessary witness without realizing the
fact that he was the most important, only
serving witness, being an eye-witness of
the occurrence. Therefore, his evidence
was the best piece of the evidence, which
the prosecution could have relied upon
for proving the case but for the reasons
best known, his evidence was withheld
and he was not examined. So a
presumption under Illustration (g) of
Article 129 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 can fairly be drawn that had the
eye-witness Manzoor Hussain been
examined in the Court his evidence would
have been unfavourable to the

prosecution.”

14. The Investigating Officer recovered 56-empties of

7.62 bore from point A, lying behind the assailants and the

-14-

prosecution is yet to tell as to whether in such eventuality the
recovery of empties from point A, was possible, keeping in view
the ejection of empties from AK-47. The empties were
recovered on 27.10.2016 along with blood stained earth, but
these were received on 17.11.2016 and 08.11.2016 respectively,
which surprised us that when both the recoveries were effected
on the same day, then why the empties were received on
17.11.2016 after a delay of 20-days. The prosecution could not
explain that where the empties were lying till its dispatch and
receipt to the office of the chemical examiner and it failed to
establish its safe custody on record, as neither the moharrir of
the concerned Police Station was produced nor the abstract from
register No.19 of the concerned Police Station was placed on
file, so the empties and its report has lost its worth and no
weight can be attached to the opinion tendered by the Forensic
Sciences Laboratory.
15. The prosecution has brought a charge against the
entire family including a father and three sons, with blood feud
motive which tells no other way but that the charge is exaggerated. It
does not appeal to prudent mind that how come a father along with
his three sons will come to a musical show and would kill a minor
boy of 18 years of age, and spare the complainant being the prime
target. It is none else but the prosecution which through its
exaggerated charge created further dents in its case, which favours
none but the accused/ appellant.

In case titled “The State Vs Muhammad Raja

and 3 others” (PLD 2004 Peshawar 1), it is held that:

-15-

“In Ghulam Sarwar v. The State
PLD 1993 Pest. 152 it was held that
witness bearing injuries on his
person, by itself, does not indicate
that he has stated truth. Having
assessed the eye-witness account
Surnished by complainant
Muhammad Akbar and Mst.
Parveen P.Ws., we. find that the
claim of these witnesses having seen
the occurrence, stands belied by host
of circumstances and cannot be
accepted in absence of corroborative
evidence. If appears that the
occurrence has not taken place in
the manner as suggested by the
prosecution and a wide net has been
thrown by the prosecution to
implicate all the male members of

the respondents family.......

16. The motive was stated to be blood feud between
the parties and it was stressed time and again that the appellant
had the motive to commit the offence, but we cannot ignore that
motive is a double-edged weapon which cuts either way. The
prosecution could not produce convincing evidence in this
respect and even the Investigating Officer did not record the
statements of independent witnesses which could prove the
motive on record. True that in each and every case the
prosecution is not required to prove the motive and that its

absence or failure will not help the accused/ appellant but

-16-

equally true that once the prosecution alleges a motive then it is
under obligation to prove the same failing which none else but
the prosecution will suffer, as is held in case titled "Hakim Ali
Vs. The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution though
not called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it has
setup a motive and failed to establish, the prosecution must
suffer consequences and not the defence. The above view has
been reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"
(PLD 1976 SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by their
lordships, that motive is an important constituent and if found by
the Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to accept

the prosecution story.

In case titled “Ali Bux and others Vs the State (2018

SCMR 354), it is held that:
“The law is settled by now that if the
prosecution asserts a motive but fails
to prove the same then such failure
on the part of the prosecution may
react against a sentence of death
passed against a convict on a capital
charge and a reference in this respect
may be made to the cases of Ahmad
Nawaz y. The State (2011 SCMR
593), Iftikhar Mehmood and another
v. Qaiser Iftikhar and others (2011
SCMR 1165), Muhammad Mumtaz v.
The State and another (2012 SCMR
267), Muhammad Imran @ Asif v.
The State (2013 SCMR 782), Sabir
Hussain alias Sabri v. The State

(2013 SCMR 1554), Zeeshan Afzal

-1|7-

alias Shani and another v. The State
and another (2013 SCMR 1602),
Naveed alias Needu and others v. The
State and others (2014 SCMR 1464),
Muhammad Nadeem Wagas and
another v. The State (2014 SCMR
1658), Muhammad Asif v
Muhammad Akhtar and others (2016
SCMR 2035) and Qaddan and others
v. The State (2017 SCMR 148).”
17. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for the

respondent that accused/ appellant remained absconder for long long
years which he could not explain; and that the long unexplained
abscondence is alone sufficient to award conviction. We do not feel
ourselves in agreement with what the learned counsel for the
complainant submitted as the prosecution is to prove its case against
the accused through cogent, coherent, and confidence-inspiring
evidence, failing which mere absconding will not come to its rescue
as in case in hand the prosecution failed to establish its case, so mere
abscondence cannot be taken against the accused and even

conviction cannot be awarded on this score alone.

18- After thoroughly evaluating the evidence available
on file this court reaches to an inescapable conclusion that the
prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case against
accused/appellant. Resultantly, this appeal is, therefore, allowed,
the conviction and sentence of the appellant recorded by the

learned trial court is set-aside and he is acquitted of the charge

-18-

by extending him the benefit of doubt, he shall be released forth
with from jail, if not required to be detained in connection with
any other case. As the appellant is acquitted of the charges by
setting aside the impugned judgment, hence, the Murder

Reference No. 10-B/2019, is answered in negative.

19- These are the detailed reasons for our short order

of the even date.
