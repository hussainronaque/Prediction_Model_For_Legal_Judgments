Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi,
Kabal, Swat, dated 23.10.2021, in respect of
case FIR No. 172 dated 15.03.2020, U/Ss

302/201 PPC, R/W Section 15-AA, P.S, Kabal,

District Swat.

2. Reportedly, the complainant,
Sanobar Khan reported the subject event to the
local police at emergency ward of Kabal
hospital in terms that on the relevant day, date
& time he was present in his house in
connection with the marriage of his nephew. At
17:30 hours, he received information from one
Faisal Hayat via mobile phone that he along
with one Israr and his nephew Khalid Khan
(deceased) have gone to the house of their aunt,
Mst. Gulshan situated at the vicinity of village
Qalagai. Both the aforesaid persons i.e. Faisal
Hayat & Israr were sitting in the house of the
accused/appellant, Sultani Room, whereas,
Khalid Khan went inside the house in order to
meet with his aunt (94). After a while, the
children of the house came to the Baitak/guest
room and informed the aforesaid two persons
with the respect to the quarrel in between

Khalid Khan and the accused/appellant, Sultani

Room. Acting on such information, when they
went inside the house in order to ease-down
both the parties. Inside the premises of the
house, the accused/appellant, Sultani Room
(while being duly armed with Kalashnikov)
started firing at Khalid Khan, as a result of it, he
got hit on right side of his belly and died on the
spot. The accused after the commission of
offence decamped from the spot and the
deceased then injured was shifted to the Kabal
hospital for treatment. For verification of the
aforesaid information conveyed by Faisal
Hayat, when the complainant went to the
emergency ward of Kabal hospital, whereby, he
found the dead body of the deceased, Khalid
Khan. The occurrence was claimed to have
been witnessed by Faisal Hayat and Israr.
Motive for the commission of offence was
stated to be verbal altercation (1% .443) which
took place between the parties. In view of the
report of the complainant, the ‘Murasila’
(Ex. PW-2/3) was drafted which culminated
into the ibid FIR (Ex. PW-14/1) registered
against the accused/appellant at PS

concerned.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

3. Upon arrest of the accused/
appellant followed by completion of
investigation, challan was drawn and was sent-
up for trial to the learned trial Court. Accused/
appellant was confronted with the statement of
allegations through a formal charge-sheet to

which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4. To substantiate the guilt of the
accused/appellant, the prosecution furnished its
account consist of the statements of fifteen (15)
witnesses. The accused was confronted with the
evidence so furnished through statement of
accused within the meaning of section 342

Cr.P.C.

5. On conclusion of the proceedings/
trial, in view of the evidence so recorded and
the assistance so rendered by the learned
counsel for the accused/appellant and the
learned counsel for the complainant/learned
State counsel, the learned trial Court arrived at
the conclusion that the prosecution has
successfully brought home charge against the

appellant/accused through cogent & worth

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-5-

reliable evidence, as such, the accused was

convicted & sentenced as follows;-

U/S 302 (b) PPC to imprisonment for life, along
with compensation in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (two
hundred thousand), U/S 544-A Cr.P.C, in default
of payment of the compensation, the accused shall
further undergo six months, simple imprisonment.

U/S 15-AA to suffer rigorous imprisonment of
three years, with fine of Rs. 10,000/- (ten
thousand), or in default of payment of fine, the
accused shall further undergo one-month, simple
imprisonment, however, the appellant was
acquitted U/S, 201 PPC.

All the sentences were ordered to run
concurrently.

The accused/appellant has also been extended the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.

6. It obliged the appellant/accused to
approach this Court through the subject
criminal appeal, whereas, the _ petitioner/
complainant has also filed the connected
criminal revision No. 72-M/2021 for
enhancement of the sentences awarded to the

accused/respondent.

7. Learned counsel for the parties
as well as the learned Astt: A.G for the State
have been heard at a length and the record

gone through with their valuable assistance.

8. The record so furnished would
divulge that in the case in hand the law of the
land was set into motion by the complainant,

Sanobar Khan (PW-11) when he reported the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan

-6-

unfortunate incident of the murder of his
nephew, Khalid Khan to the local police at
emergency ward of Kabal hospital, whereby,
he specifically charged the accused/appellant,
Sultani Room for committing the murder of
the deceased by firing at him through his
Kalashnikov. Motive for the commission of
the offence was stated to be verbal altercation
which took place between the parties at the
spur of the moment. It is also an admitted fact
on both ends, that the complainant himself is
not an eyewitness of the occurrence as at the
relevant time he was present in his house in
connection with the marriage of his nephew.
The whole charge of the complainant against
the accused/appellant qua the murder of the
deceased is based on the  ocular-
account/information conveyed by PWs, Faisal
Hayat and Israr. Both of them have
accompanied the deceased Khalid Khan to the
house of the accused/appellant, Sultani Room,
wherefrom, they were supposed to bring the
other PW, Mst. Gulshan to the house of her

parents. It is also an admitted fact floating on

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-7-

the surface of the record that the entire
prosecution’s case hinges upon _ the
testimonies of both the aforesaid witnesses as
well as the ocular-account furnished by
another eyewitness of the occurrence, Mst.
Gulshan Bibi. On his own turn, Faisal Hayat,
appeared in the witness-box as PW-10. In his
examination-in-chief, he almost reiterated the
same facts as advanced in the ‘Murasila’
followed by the ibid FIR lodged by the
complainant, qua the effective role of
committing the murder of the deceased,
Khalid Khan, by the accused/appellant,
Sultani Room, by firing at him through his
Kalashnikov and that too inside the premises
of his house. It is very much clear from the
examination-in-chief of this PW that he has
come up with a very straight-forward &
natural narrations of the occurrence in terms
that on the fateful day he in the company of
other PW, Israr accompanied the deceased,
Khalid Khan in order to bring the PW Mst.
Gulshan Bibi to the house of her parents and

at the relevant time they were sitting in the

Baitak/guest room and upon hearing the
sound of quarrel as well as pursuant to the call
of Mst. Gulshan Bibi when they went inside
the | house they saw the accused/appellant,
while being duly armed with Kalashnikov
started firing at Khalid Khan, as a result of it,
he got hit and died on the spot. He was cross-
examined at considerable length by the
learned counsel for the defence, however, the
probative worth of his testimony qua the
effective role of committing the murder of the
deceased could not be shattered. With the
blessing of the learned counsel for the
defence, the arrival of the complainant-party
to the spot of occurrence was confirmed &
verified in view of the depositions of PW-10,
in the following words;-

Same was the case with the
testimony of another eyewitness of the
occurrence, Mst. Gulshan Bibi. She appeared
in the Court as PW-9. In her examination-in-
chief, she deposed almost the same narrations
of the occurrence as advanced by PW-10,
Faisal Hayat, qua the murder of the deceased,
Khalid Khan, committed by nobody else but
her real husband, therefore, this element alone
excludes all possibilities of consultations or
deliberations on the part of the complainant-
party qua implication of the accused/appellant
as a single accused in the case in hand. With
respect to the presence of the deceased and
other PWs, she deposed in her examination-
in-cross, in the following terms;-

The complainant of the case in

his account furnished in the Court is adamant
of the fact that the deceased, Khalid Khan, in
the company of other eyewitnesses i.e. Faisal
Hayat & Israr were gone to the house of
the accused/appellant, Sultani Room in order
to pick the other PW, Mst. Gulshan Bibi. The
prosecution also made reliance on the account
of Mst. Wilayat Bibi. She appeared in the
witness-box as PW-12. In her examination-in-
chief, she has put-forward the purpose of the
visit of the complainant-party to the house of
the accused/appellant, in the following terms;-

The complainant as well as
the PW-12 were cross-examined at a
substantial length, however, nothing
favourable to the accused/appellant could
be extracted from their mouths qua the-
presence of the deceased & other
eyewitnesses at the venue of crime i.e. the

house of the accused/appellant.

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-li-

9. Bare look of the trend of cross-
examinations of PW-9 & PW-10 would
reflect that they have not been cross-
examined in terms of their presence in the
house of the accused/appellant on the
fateful day in the company of the deceased,
Khalid Khan. The presence of the
aforesaid eyewitnesses of the occurrence
also affirmed by way of testimony of PW-
5, Akhtar Munir, Constable, who stated in
his examination-in-cross that when they
went to the venue of crime, the
eyewitnesses i.e. Israr & Faisal Hayat were
present there, however, they were called to
the spot pursuant to the information

conveyed by police.

10. The learned counsel for the
accused/appellant also raised an objection
in respect of the testimonies of
the witnesses i.e. Mst. Gulshan Bibi,
PW-9, Faisal Hayat, PW-10 and

the complainant, Sanabor Khan, PW

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-12-
Il (uncle of the deceased), being closely

related to the deceased. It is transparent from
the record that neither during the investigation
nor during the trial an iota of evidence could
have been surfaced which could prima facie
speak of any ill-will or malafide on part of the
star witnesses of the prosecution which could
strike the prudent mind as to depose falsely
against the accused/appellant for their vested
interest. In this regard, reliance is placed on
the judgment of Apex Court rendered in case
titled “Oamar-uz-Zaman alias Kala v/s The
State” reported as 2011 SCMR 856. It was
also held by the Apex Court in case titled
“Naik Muhammad alias Nika & another v/s
The_State” reported as 2007 SCMR_ 1639
that mere relationship of witnesses with
deceased per se would not render them

interested or partisan witnesses.

11. The medical evidence furnished
by PW-3, Dr. Sami Ullah further boost &
substantiates the version of the prosecution.
As per medical-legal report of the deceased

i.e. Ex. PW-3/1, he has received multiple

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
s

-13-

firearm injuries on his body, which is exactly
in consonance with the story of the
prosecution, therefore, the medical evidence
of the subject event duly supports the stance
of the prosecution. Even otherwise, it is well
settled that corroboration is only rule of
caution and not a rule of law. If testimony of
an eyewitness is found reliable & trustworthy
then there is hardly any need to look for any
corroboration. In this regard, reliance is
placed on the case law titled “ Muhammad

Waris v/s The State” reported as 2008 SCMR

784. Similarly, it was also held by the Apex

Court in case titled “Shafat Ali & others v/s
The State” reported as PLD 2005 Supreme
Court 288 that as far as medical evidence or
expert’s opinion was concerned, it was always
treated to be confirmatory in nature and if
there was ocular account fully reliable in
support of incident, then the minor
contradictions in medical and ocular account,

if any, could be outweighed.

12. The case in hand is also having

sufficient circumstantial evidence in the form of

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
ee

-14-

recovery of blood stained earth, crime empties
of 7.62 bore from the spot (in scattered
conditions) and weapon of offence i.e.
Kalashnikov, on the pointation of the
accused/appellant coupled with positive FSL
report, therefore, the circumstantial evidence is

also in line with the version of the prosecution.

13. As a result of cumulative effect of
evidence of the prosecution, the Court has
reached to the conclusion that the accused/
appellant has rightly been found guilty of
commission of the offence, however, his sentence
of life imprisonment requires a rethinking. It is
part of the record and as highlighted by the
learned counsel for the appellant/accused that
there is an ordinate delay of one hour in reporting
the matter to the local police despite the fact that
as per version of the prosecution the complainant
was informed well within time by the eyewitness,
Faisal Hayat through his mobile phone from the
alleged occurrence of the murder of the deceased,
therefore, he was under statutory obligation to
inform the local police with utmost promptitude,
however, as per available record, the prosecution

could not furnish any plausible explanation qua

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
so

-15-

the delay of one hour occurred in reporting the
matter to the local police. It is also evident from
the bare perusal of the record that the most
important & relevant eye-witness of the
occurrence i.e. Israr son of Shah Bahadar was not
examined by the prosecution, therefore, an
inference could be drawn within the meaning of
Article 129 (g), Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
that had he been produced he would have not
supported the case of prosecution. Similarly, the
testimony of PW-9, Mst. Gulshan Bibi is of no
legal worth for the prosecution qua the guilt of
the accused/appellant, as her name has neither
been mentioned in the ‘Murasila’ followed by the
ibid FIR nor she has been cited as an eyewitness
of the occurrence in the site plan, Ex. PW-15/1.
There is also in field the delayed statement of the
PW, Mst. Gulshan Bibi, whose testimony could
be of paramount importance to the case of
prosecution as she was nobody else but the real
wife of the accused/appellant and aunt (ts) of
the deceased, Khalid Khan. Other than it, the
prosecution has not been able to bring on record
any specific motive that why the

accused/appellant was all-out to kill the deceased

‘Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
J

-16-

and that too inside the premises of his house
rather the motive as set-up by the prosecution in
the form of verbal altercation (51 45) prima
facie suggests that the occurrence might have
taken place at the spur of the moment , therefore,
prima facie, it seems that the accused/appellant
was having no premeditation or intention to kill
the deceased. On all counts, all these minor
weaknesses & lacunas in the evidence of
prosecution, as discussed hereinabove, may not
be taken as a justification for the out-right
acquittal of the accused/appellant, but such
weaknesses may be considered for reduction of
the sentence as held by the Apex Court in case

titled “Mst. Bevi_v4 Ghulam Shabbir and

another” reported as “1980 SCMR 859”,
wherein, it has been observed;-

“It has been held in some cases that the principle
underlying the concept of benefit of doubt can in
addition to the consideration of question of guilt or
otherwise, be pressed also in matter of sentence. As
a definite motive was asserted against the
respondent and the same has failed, keeping in view
all the circumstances of this case, it would not be
necessary to impose the capita’ punishment,
Therefore while finding him guilty; under section
302, P. P. C. he is sentenced to transportation for life
should be awarded as compensation.”

A similar rational has also been
expounded by the Apex Court in case titled

“Mir Muhammad alias Miro v/s The State”

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Shahid Khan
. -17-
reported as 2009 SCMR 1188. Further reliance

may also be placed on the judgments rendered
in case titled “Muhammad Ayaz Khan v/s
Murtaza and other” reported as 2008 SCMR
984 and case titled “Kamran Ullah v/s The
State and another” reported as 2020 SCMR
1214.

14. Similarly, in eventuality when an
accused person committed an offence without
any premeditation or planning and in the heat
of a free-fight had struck the deceased with a
single blow. In such circumstances, his case
would come within clause (c) of section 302,
PPC. Conviction of accused recorded U/S 302
(b) PPC was altered to one U/S 302 (c) PPC
and consequently, his sentence of life
imprisonment was reduced to ten years
imprisonment. Reference can be made to the
case law Titled “Zeeshan alias Shani V/S The
State (PLD 2017 Supreme Court _165).
Needless to highlight that in the event in hand,
the accused/appellant was also confronted with
the same set of allegations in terms that the

occurrence took place at the spur of the

Nawab (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shahid Khan
-18-

moment during the course of verbal altercation
without any premeditation or planning on the
part of the accused/appellant. All such
circumstances are taken as __ sufficient
justification for reduction of the sentence from
the normal penalty of life imprisonment to ten
years imprisonment.

15. In view of the above discussion
and exposition of law, the subject criminal
appeal is partially allowed to the extent that the
sentence of life imprisonment awarded to the
accused/ appellant, Sultani Room, U/S 302 (b)
PPC is reduced to ten (10) years imprisonment
within the meaning of section 302 (c) PPC. The
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is also
extended to the appellant/accused, whereas, the
rest of the impugned order/judgment dated
23.10.2021 shall remain intact.

16. Since we have allowed the appeal
filed by the appellant/accused against his
conviction & sentence, therefore, the connected
criminal revision bearing No. 72-M/2021 filed
by the petitioner/complainant for enhancement

of the sentence awarded to the accused/
