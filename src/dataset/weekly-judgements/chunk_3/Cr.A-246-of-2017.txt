2. The ‘Murasila’ followed by lodging of the
First Information Report would reveal that during
routine patrolling of the area the local police
received spy information with regard to proclaimed
offender Ali Askar being involved in case FIR No.
351 dated 04.09.2011 under section 302 PPC
registered at PS Nawagi. Therefore, in view of such
information, the police rushed to the spot arrested the
accused/Appellant. During his personal search from
the trouser-fold of his Shalwar the police recovered
30 bore pistol along with magazine and 3 cartridges.
Since the accused could not produce any license or
permit in respect of the same pistol, therefore, it was
taken into possession vide recovery memo Ex. PW-
1/1. Hence, on the strength of 'Murasila' Ex. PA/1,
FIR Ex. PW-PA was chalked-out against the
accused/Appellant at the same Police Station
Nawagi.

3. In a full dressed trial, after framing of
charge against the accused/Appellant by the learned
Trial Court on 27.02.2013 when the asservations
were not acceptable to him, he claimed trial. Thereby
the prosecution examined Muhammad Shah Khan

SHO as PW-1, Umar Rahim official of Frontier

Constabulary bearing No. 725 as PW-2 and
Ghulam Khan SI as PW-3. At the end, the statement
of the accused/Appellant Yousaf Khan was recorded
u/s 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, thereby
denied the charge, posed innocence and stated to
have falsely been implicated in the case. He,
however wished to produce defence within the
meaning of section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. After hearing the
parties at length the decision under conviction for the
sentences was delivered.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/Appellant and learned State
counsel, record was gone through with their valuable
assistance.

5, Perusal of the record would reveal that on
30.01.2013 at 16:45 hours Muhammad Shah Khan
SHO PS Nawagi, PW-1 during routine Ghast of the
Illaqa received spy information that proclaimed

offender Ali Askar wanted in case FIR No. 351 dated

po04.09.2011 under section 302 PPC registered at PS

Nawagi has been present at Jangai road near Ambela
Petrol Pump. So, in view of such clue, the said SHO
along with police party proceeded to the spot and

arrested the accused/Appellant. During his personal

search one 30 bore pistol along with magazine and 3
cartridges were recovered. However, during cross-
examination this PW admitted that the alleged
recovery of pistol was made from the
accused/Appellant near the petrol pump. Yet no
independent or impartial witness has been associated
with the recovery process in order to further
authenticate the version of prosecution with regard to
the alleged recovery of pistol being weapon of
offence in the main case. It is further evident from
the cross-examination of this PW that at the time of
arrest of the accused/Appellant on sighting the police
vehicle in close approximate of 10/12 paces he did
not try to escape from the spot. So, from such act of
the accused/Appellant an inference could be gathered
that he might have surrendered himself to the local
police and thereafter the alleged recovery of pistol
might have been attributed to him being proclaimed

offender. Otherwise, in ordinary parlance the

' / accused being involved in murder case and that too

when had been declared proclaimed offender, thus,
in all possibilities would have tried to whisk off his
presence at least from public places. PW-2 Umar

Rahim Frontier Constabulary official though

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

reiterated the stance of prosecution in his statement
before the Court, however during cross-examination
admitted that the accused/Appellant was arrested at
Shahi road and at the relevant time the concerned
SHO did not give him any instruction with regard to
association of any independent or private witnesses
with the recovery process. The last witness of
prosecution is Ghulam Khan SI PW-3, who has
conducted the investigation in this case. This PW
during cross-examination admitted that in the site
plan there was a reference of the house of Qalandar
yet he has not been examined as witness during
Court proceedings.
6. No doubt, these statements of the
prosecution witnesses have created a serious dint in
the version of prosecution with regard to the alleged
recovery of pistol from the person of
accused/Appellant. Thus, in all probabilities it can
be said with certainty that the prosecution has badly
ne failed to bring home charges against the
e—
accused/Appellant for the recovery of crime weapon
(pistol) along with magazine and 3 cartridges,
therefore, the accused/Appellant deserves to be given

liberty by way of his acquittal.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

Ts Even otherwise, it is settled by now that
the recovery of crime weapon and empties etc are
always considered to be corroborative piece of
evidence and such kind of evidence by itself is not
sufficient to bring home the charges against the
accused especially when the other material
put-forward by the prosecution in respect of guilt of
the accused/Appellant has already been disbelieved.

This view has been affirmed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in case cited as
2001 SCMR 424 "' Imran Ashraf and 7 others vs
the State" in the following manner:-

"Recovery of incriminating articles is
used for the purpose of providing
corroboration to the ocular testimony.
Ocular evidence and _ recoveries,
therefore, are to be considered
simultaneously in order to reach for a

just conclusion."

Likewise, if any other judgment is needed

on the same analogy, reference can be placed on

2007 _SCMR __1427 _'"'_ Dr. _Israr-ul-Ha vs
pol

8 Muhammad _Fayyaz_and_another"", wherein the
relevant citation (c) enunciates:
"Direct evidence having failed,

corroborative evidence was of no help.

When ocular evidence is disbelieved in

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-9-

a criminal case then the recovery of
an incriminating article in the nature

of weapon of offence does not by itself

prove the prosecution case.

8. In view of the above discussion, we are
of the absolute view that the prosecution failed to
prove its case against the accused/Appellant
beyond any shadow of doubt; therefore, his
conviction cannot be maintained, ergo, while
extending the benefit of doubt, we accept this
appeal by setting aside his conviction and
sentences recorded by the learned trial Court
through the impugned judgment dated 21.08.2014
and acquit him of the charges leveled against him.
He be set free forthwith, if not required in any

other case.

9. These are the reasons of our short order

of even date.

10. Before parting with this judgment, it is

\k&_necessary to give reference of the criminal
e—

miscellaneous application bearing No. 277-M of

2017 preferred by the applicant/Appellant for

condonation of delay with regard to filing of

appeal against his conviction before this Court.

Besides the grounds advanced in this application

Keeping in sight the ratio decidendi
settled in the above dictum of the Hon'ble Lahore

accused/Appellant that he came to know about his
conviction under section 13 A.O at the time of
arguments of before this Court, therefore, the
