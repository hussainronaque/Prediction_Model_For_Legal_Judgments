file. The Investigation Office has also placed

Upon completion of the investigation,
complete challan was forwarded to the SHO
concerned for onward submission.

4, During the course of trial, the
prosecution examined as many as 14
witnesses, whose statements were recorded
and placed on file. On closure of the
prosecution evidence, accused were examined
under section 342, Cr.P.C, wherein they
denied the charges, claimed innocence and
stated to have falsely been implicated in the
case.

5. On conclusion of the trial, the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/ Izafi Zila
Matta Swat convicted and sentenced the
accused/appellant Muhammad Pervaiz vide
the judgment impugned herein, whereas the

co-accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen was

NAWAB_ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
acquitted from the charges by extending her
the benefit of doubt, hence the present appeal.
6. Arguments heard and record of
the case was perused with the able assistance
of learned counsels for the parties as well as
the learned Law Officer representing the
State.

Te It is the case of prosecution
incorporated in Nagal Mad No. 17 dated
12.12.2015, wherein the complainant
Muhammad Zahir Shah and Shah Fahad had
filed an application for the recovery of Mst.
Musarrat Shaheen wife of Mian Said Jamal,
the acquitted accused, who went missing on
08.12.2015 at 01:00 P.M at Nazir market
Matta. It was further reported in the Mad
report that Mst. Musarrat Shaheen is the sister
of applicant No. 1 Muhammad Zahir Shah

whereas mother of the applicant No. 2

NAWAB _ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
Shah Fahad, who on the eventful day had
gone to the hospital for treatment alongwith
her other son Ishfaq. Both of them alighted
from the vehicle at Chuprial Adda, there she
sent her son Ishfaq for bringing some food,
however, when he came back her mother was
not available there. Since the acquitted
accused as per prosecution case had a mobile
phone, therefore, her mobile phone was traced
through CDR and accordingly the said Mad
report was incorporated into ‘Murasila’ Ex.
PW-14/6 on 12.12.2015 wherein the present
accused/appellant Muhammad Pervaiz and
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen alongwith other
co-accused were charged by the complainant.
On the strength of the said ‘Murasila’ FIR
ibid was registered against the accused at PS

concerned.

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
8. On 04.01.2016 the said Mst.
Musarrat Shaheen, the acquitted accused was
recovered by the police from the house of
present accused/appellant situated at
Rajanpur, Punjab and on the same day after
obtaining transit custody from the competent
Court of the Judicial Magistrate she was
transferred to District Swat alongwith
accused/appellant Muhammad Pervaiz. On the
following day ie. 05.01.2016 Mst. Musarrat
Sheheen was produced before the Court
wherein she recorded her statement under
section 164 Cr.P.C confessing her guilt. In the
said confession she has stated that she was
married to Mian Said Jamal and out of said
wedlock she had four sons and two daughters.
Mian Said Jamal her husband was working for
gain at Saudi Arabia, however, his attitude

was not good with her. She got fed up from

NAWAB _ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
~

that life and thus started contacting the
appellant through his mobile phone. She with
her sweet will went to the house of
Muhammad Pervaiz at Rajanpur, Punjab and
narrated her story to him, who offered Mst.
Musarrat Shaheen to marry him (appellant)
and accordingly she contracted marriage with
the appellant because some five (5) years back
she was divorced by her husband Mian Said
Jamal.

9. The present appellant
Muhammad Pervaiz is charged under section
365-B of the Pakistan Penal Code (“PPC”) for
inducement of Mst. Musarrat Shaheen, the
acquitted co-accused in order to compel her
for illegal marriage against her will during
subsistence of her earlier Nikah with one
Mian Said Jamal. The entire prosecution case

is based on the oral testimony of the

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
complainant Muhammad Zahir Shah, PW-1,
Ishfaq Ahmad, PW-2, Mst. Kharoo, PW-3,
Shah Fahad, PW-5, Mian Said Jamal
PW-10, CDR reports, recovery of the said
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen from the house of the
accused/appellant situated at Rajanpur, Punjab
and the alleged confession of the acquitted
co-accused.

10. A bare look of the testimony
of the complainant Muhammad Zahir Shah,
PW-1 it would reveal that her sister Mst.
Musarrat Shaheen was married to one Mian
Said Jamal. On 08.12.2015 at 13:00 hours she
had gone to Matta hospital for treatment. On
return, son of the abductee namely Ishfaq
informed the complainant about missing of
her mother, therefore, in this respect he had
lodged a report on 12.12.2015 at 13:55 hours

to the DSP Matta alongwith other son of the

NAWAB  {D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
sift:

abductee Shah Fahad. Later, the said report
was incorporated in Nagal Mad No. 17 of the
daily diary dated 12.12.2015 and inquiry was
initiated in the matter. During course of
inquiry, the complainant recorded his
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C and
charged the present appellant Muhammad
Pervaiz for contracting illegal marriage with
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen during subsistence of
her earlier Nikah with one Mian Said Jamal,
whereas the other co-accused have been
charged for abetment.

11. The other PWs related to the
acquitted co-accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen
had also recorded somewhat similar
statements before the Court in respect of guilt
of the accused/appellant, however, it is an
admitted fact surfacing on the record that

none of above-referred witnesses have

NAWAB = (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-12-

witnessed the occurrence in person or for that
matter no one has come forward as witness to
have seen the appellant abducting/inducing
the co-accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen for the
purpose of illegal marriage, therefore, their
testimony are based on hearsay evidence,
which cannot be made basis for conviction of
the present accused/appellant.

12. Regarding the CDR report, Ex.
PW-14/5, which has been given much weight
by the learned trial Court in respect of the
guilt of the present accused/appellant to the
effect that allegedly the appellant and the
acquitted co-accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen
had communicated with each other through
their cell phones 38 times from 07.12.2015 to
09.12.2015. In respect of the CDR data,
suffice it to say, that the same is of no

importance to the prosecution on various

NAWAB_ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
= [B=

counts. As initially, it was the duty of the
prosecution to have received the C.D.R with
an endorsement of the Cellular Company
concerned, having stamp and _ signature
thereupon of the concerned authorized officer,
then while taking into possession the CDR,
through a recovery memo, at least a concerned
person should have been associated from the
Cellular Company to independently prove the
recovery or at least, recorded the statement of
representative of the Cellular Company to the
effect of issuance and receipt of C.D.R. but no
such evidence have been collected. The
perusal of CDR also demonstrates that
there is not even a single signature of
authorized officer of the said Company, thus,
it cannot be safely relied upon in
any manner. Similar is the — situation

regarding the cell No. 033244952582. There

NAWAB __ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-14-

is no record that the said cell number was
registered in his name or whose name the said
Sim was registered.

13. Another incriminating evidence
in the account of accused/appellant is the
retracted judicial confession made by the
acquitted co-accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen.
It discerns from record that the co-accused
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen was recovered from
the house of appellant situated in Rajanpur,
Punjab on 04.01.2016 and on the same date
after obtaining transit custody from the
competent Court of the Judicial Magistrate
she was transferred to District Swat alongwith
accused/appellant Muhammad Pervaiz. On the
following day i.e. 05.01.2016 Mst. Musarrat
Sheheen was produced before the Court
wherein she recorded her confessional

statement, Ex. PW-12/3 confessing her guilt

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
ip =

before the Judicial Magistrate Matta, PW-12.
However, without rendering further findings
in respect of merit or demerit of the
confession, suffice it to say, that the said
confession was retracted by the principal i.e.
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen, the acquitted co-
accused, therefore, the same cannot be used
against the present appellant. Even otherwise,
the confession of accused is a circumstantial
evidence against the co-accused under Article
43 Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which
need strong corroboration. In this regard
reliance is placed on “Mushtaq and others vs

the State (2012 SCMR 109)”, wherein it was

held by the august Supreme Court of
Pakistan:- “As the accused did not admit to
have killed the deceased, therefore, he could
not be held responsible for killing, on the

confessional statement of co-accused.”

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
~

-16-

The same ratio further reflects in

“

Abdur_Rehman’s case reported as 2018

YER 1629”, wherein it was held by the
Hon’ble High Court:- “Confession made by
accused could not be used as a substantive
piece of evidence to make the same basis of
conviction of co-accused. Confessional
statement could be used a corroborative
piece of evidence, if corroborated by
independent evidence.”’

14. In context of the present case, the
confession so made by the acquitted co-
accused Mst. Musarrat Shaheen was not only
later on retracted by her but from bare perusal
of the said confession it appears that she with
her own sweet will went to the house of the
accused/appellant and the elements of force,
pressure and coercion on behalf of the

appellant were missing in the said confession.

NAWAB  (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
o [ie

Rather she has stated in her confession that
she was divorced by her husband some 5
years back, therefore, she had contracted
marriage with the appellant. Hence, in no
way, this confession could be used in respect
of conviction of the accused/appellant, which
is discarded accordingly.

15, The learned counsel has given
much emphasis on the leading
question/admission by the learned counsel
representing the accused and has stated that in
cross-examination he has almost admitted the
occurrence by giving a positive suggestion to
the prosecution witnesses, however, we cannot
agree with such assertion of learned counsel for
the complainant for obvious reasons that it is
settled law that the accused is not bound by
admission made his counsel during cross
examination of prosecution witnesses. In this

regard, reliance is place on the judgment

NAWAB- (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
@>

~

= 18

of august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as
“Abdul Khaliq vs the State” (1996 SCMR
1553), wherein it was held:- “This statement
was sought to be used by learned Additional
Advocate-General against the appellant, as
his admission to the effect that he had fired
at the deceased. Even if putting of such
question in cross-examination by the defence
counsel amounts to an admission, the same
cannot bind the appellant. In a criminal case
an accused is not bound by the admissions
made by his counsel.”

16. The gist of the whole discussion
is that there is no direct oral evidence against
the guilt of the present appellant and the
circumstantial evidence is not well chained to
connect the appellant with the commission of
offence. Indeed, in order to award conviction

to the accused on the basis of circumstantial

NAWAB = (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr, Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-19-

evidence it is settled law that great care and
caution must be exercised by Court. In this
regard, reliance can be placed on the judgment

of august Supreme Court of Pakistan cited as

if

Imran_alias Dullay_and_ another vs The

State and others” (2015 SCMR 155), wherein
it was held:- “Case resting entirely upon

circumstantial evidence. Caution to be exercised by
court. When any case rested entirely on
circumstantial evidence then, each piece of evidence
collected must provide all links making out one
straight chain where one end of its noose fitted in
the neck of the accused and the other end touched
the dead body. Any link missing from the chain
would disconnect and break the whole chain and in
that event conviction could not be safely recorded
and that too on a capital charge. Courts had to
exercise more and more caution before accepting
and resting their opinion of being guilty on
circumstantial evidence collected apparently in a

dishonest, dubious and rough manner.” Where as

NAWAB _ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan
Mr. Justice Syed Arshad Ali
-20-

in the present case the evidence that the lady
was recovered from the house of the appellant
is neither based on confidence inspiring
evidence nor the same is further corroborated
with other circumstantial evidence to connect
the appellant with the allegation that he had
illegally induced the acquitted co-accused
Mst. Musarrat Shaheen for marriage despite
having already married.

17. In view of the above discussion,
we are of the absolute view that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case against
the accused/appellant beyond any shadow of
doubt; therefore, his conviction cannot be
maintained, resultantly, while extending him
the benefit of doubt, we accept this appeal by
setting aside his conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial Court through the

impugned judgment and acquit him of the

NAWAB _ (D.B.) Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan

charge levelled against him. He be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

18. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
