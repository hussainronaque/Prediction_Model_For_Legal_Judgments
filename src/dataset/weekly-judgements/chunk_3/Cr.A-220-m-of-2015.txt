RI

e All the sentences shall run concurrently,
however, benefit of section 382 (B) Cr.P.C was
extended to the accused/Appellant.

2. The co-accused Bakhtyar, Noor-ul-Wahab

and Malik Quowat Khan upon their acquittal, the
State has preferred Criminal Appeal bearing No.
241-M/2015 under section 25 of the Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 read with Para 10 (8) of the Sharia Nizam-
e-Adl Regulation 2009 calling for setting aside the
judgment and to be rendered conviction upon
passing of an appropriate sentence.
3. The State has also preferred Criminal
Appeal bearing No. 240-M/2015 against the
convicted accused/Respondent Daulat Khan for the
purpose of enhancement of his sentence to life
imprisonment which would be more appropriate
keeping the offence being graver in nature. Hence,
ws all these connected criminal appeals are taken up for
each disposal through this singled-out judgment.
4. The set of four (4) accused Daulat Khan,

Bakhtiyar, Noor-ul-Wahab and Malak Quowat Khan

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

were jointly charge-sheeted to the effect that they
had issued threats and criminally intimated the
complainant Shafiq-ur-Rahman through mobile
phone bearing No. 0311-4264111 sharing their
common intention received by the complainant on
his mobile phone No. 0343-9442024 on 26.12.2014
at evening time and on 27.12.2014 at an unknown
time as the complainant was present in his house.
There was a demand of extortion of Rs. 300,000/- as
‘Bahatta’ with the extended threats to the
complainant of dire consequences. Besides the
charge runs that when the demand of extortion of
Rs. 300,000/- as ‘Bhatta’ was made from the
complainant, he was placed in fear of death and
grievous hurt in order to commit the offence of
extortion and at all these accused are stated to have
shared their common intention while calling the
complainant on his mobile phone number and

making a demand of Rs. 300,000/- as ‘Bhatta’. This

2 oct of these accused created a sense of fear, terror

and insecurity amongst the society. Therefore,
besides ordinary sections of law mainly the
prosecution built up its case under section 7 ATA

read with section 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.

5. All the set of four (4) accused did not
plead each guilt and claimed trial, thereby in order to
bring charges the prosecution examined Khiyal Said
SI as PW-1, Kifayatullah Constable bearing No.1155
as PW-2, Fazal Hussain as PW-3, Farmanullah
Constable No. 1160 as PW-4, the complainant of this
case Shafiq-ur-Rahman as PW-5, Hayat Ali Shah
SHO as PW-6, Najeebullah Constable No. 1565 as
PW-7, Ghani-ur-Rahman SHO as PW-8, Said-ul-
Amin Inspector as PW-8, Jouhar Rahman SI as PW-
9 and under the statement of Mr. Arif Bilal Senior
Public Prosecutor evidence of the prosecution was
closed.
6. Thereafter, each of accused was examined
under section 342 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, they posed innocence and stated to have
falsely been implicated in the case. They neither
wished to produce defence nor to examine
themselves on oath as required under section 340(2),
pe

Te After hearing the parties at length, the

decision under conviction for the sentences was

delivered in respect of accused/Appellant Daulat

Khan, whereas the co-accused Bakhtiyar, Noor-ul-

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

Wahab and Malak Quowat Khan were acquitted
through the same impugned judgment, hence, these
connected matters.

8. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the convict/Appellant Daulat Khan,
learned counsel for the acquitted
accused/Respondents and learned Astt: Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State, the
requisitioned record delved deep into with their
valuable assistance.

9. At first instance, learned counsel for the
accused/Appellant Daulat Khan on his own produced
the complainant of this case by the name of Shafiq-
ur-Rahman, who is present before the Court and
states that he has effected compromise with the
accused/Appellant Daulat Khan and is no more
interested in his prosecution. Consequent to the plea
of compromise, learned counsel for the

accused/Appellant referred to 2015 P Cr. LJ 1142

In many cases like receiving ‘Bhatta’ the
accused are dangersome as when their demand is not
met, they materialize the threats being extended of
the dire consequences and by placing the persons
under the fear of death from whom the ‘Bhatta’ has
not been received.The goal is certainly accomplished

—! —upon the damage being caused but when such an
accused is entangled and has been prosecuted
accordingly he then exert pressure upon the

complainant to enter into compromise as to save his

own skin from conviction. Obviously, conviction in
such cases is very harsh as there are no remissions
and the act is of terrorism, such like accused is
declared as terrorist.
10. All the judgments which have been
referred to as above, there is no ancillary judgment
for to patch up the matter under compromise in
between the parties when the offences are covered
under the Anti-Terrorism Laws. Therefore, we are
constrained to consider this aspect of compromise in
between the complainant and the accused/Appellant
Daulat Khan as it is feared that such like
compromise may be on account of coercion and
exertion of pressure upon the complainant.
11. Looking forward for the prosecution
evidence, the statement of the complainant Shafiq-
ur-Rahman PW-5 coupled statement of PW-6 Hayat
Ali Shah SHO PS Charbagh and PW-8 statement of
Ghani-ur-Rahman SHO PS CTD have been brought
win as when the complainant had received telephonic
cc
call for the demand of ‘Bhatta’ amount of
Rs. 300,000/-. The said amount of Rs. 300,000/-
were arranged and it was placed near the wall of the

school and after short time the accused Daulat Khan

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-8-

came there and when he was picking up the money
the police apprehended him. At that time the said
accused had muffled his face with ‘Chadar’ (os)
which was removed by the police and he disclosed
his name as Daulat Khan. The Station House Officer
recovered the extortion amount of ‘Bhatta’ which
had been placed near the wall on the accused prior
direction. This statement of the complainant clearly
finds in consonance with the statement of PW-6
Hayat Ali Shah SHO that the caller demanded Rs.
300,000/- as Bhatta’ had come to the place near the
wall of the school from where the amount was
picked up by him and he was about to run when
apprehended by the police officials. After disclosure
of his name as Daulat Khan the amount of ‘Bhatta’
was recovered from his direct possession. The
amount of Rs. 300,000/- comprised of currency notes
of one thousand denomination and later after
recovery it were signed by the Station House Officer
Hayat Ali Shah. Consequently PW-7 Constable
Najeebullah has also narrated the same version. The
police officials were standing at a distance 2/3 paces
from each other and they were visible to one another

but not to the accused/Appellant Daulat Khan and

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-9-

when the time he picked up the amount he was
apprehended by the Station House Officer. The next
police official is PW-8 Ghani-ur-Rahman SHO who
is also a responsible police official, he has narrated
word by word the same occurrence. Thereby when
an accused is apprehended on the spot and the
recovery has been effected from his person of the
‘Bhatta’ amount which too an amount of Rs. 3 lacs
then there is very less hope for to believe the
innocence of such accused and rather hard to
disbelieve the police officials against whom there is
no allegation of any malafide or for any other reason
that they have apprehended the accused/Appellant
with ulterior motive except that he was caught red-
handed with the ‘Bhatta’ amount and had come to
the place for to collect the said amount.

12. Whereas the judgment of the Hon’ble
Peshawar High Court reported as 2017 P Cr.LJ 992
(Peshawar) “Atta Ullah _V/S'| The State _and
another” there is reference to that in the case
extortion of money, the appreciation of the evidence
is required and when there are allegations of demand
of extortion of money and threatening calls to the

complainant, which ought to have been be proved. It

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
-10-

is necessary to establish the ownership of the mobile
phone allegedly shown to be of the complainant.
When the recovery of similar mobile phone
recovered from the possession of accused had not
been proved through the recovery memo and there is
no record of the concerned network company which
has been produced by the prosecution then for the
circumstances creating doubt the veracity of the
prosecution case has to be resolved in favour of the
accused. It’s true that the prosecution was bound to
prove its case accordingly but where the
accused/Appellant Daulat Khan has been directly
apprehended by the police when he picked the
amount of ‘Bhatta’ of Rs. 300,000/- from the place
near the wall of the school which scene has been
witnessed by all those police officials and there
veracity has never been shattered. Then the record of
the mobile phone is never the consideration for
proving the guilt of the accused.

13. We, accordingly under the prayer as set up
in this criminal appeal hereby decrease the sentence
of the accused/Appellant Daulat Khan from 6 years
rigorous imprisonment awarded under section 7 (h)

of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 to 5 years RI.

However, the accused/Appellant is extended the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. He upon serving
rest of his sentences shall then be released from Jail
if not required in any other case. The Jail Authorities
be informed accordingly from this new development
with regard to decrease of the sentence of
accused/Appellant as referred to above. The criminal
appeal preferred by the accused/Appellant is
answered accordingly.

14, Whereas the judgment of learned Anti-
Terrorism Court with regard acquittal of the co-
accused Bakhtiyar, Noor-ul-Wahab and Malak
Quowat Khan all the considerable points for
determination, the prosecution has badly failed to
bring home the charges against each of them would
besides be more plausible to uphold the judgment for
reason that here is no appropriate evidence as none
of these accused have been neither arrested from the
place from where the co-accused/Appellant Daulat
Khan had picked up the ‘Bhatta’ amount nor their
names are find mentioned in the ‘Murasila’ followed
by lodging of the First Information Report. Even any
other evidence linked them under chain of such like

grievous charges against each of them, the statement

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
aed

= 12s

of the complainant Shafig-ur-Rahman recorded as
PW-S5 is of paramount importance in this behalf,
wherein under an admission during his cross-
examination this PW stated that it is correct that the
accused namely Noor-ul-Wahab, Qowat Khan and
Bakhtiar had not contacted him during that period
regarding the threats and ‘Bhatta’ amount and
further deposed that he could not recognize the voice
of the culprits amongst anyone of these accused.
Even otherwise, the case of these acquitted
accused/Respondents is quite distinguishable from
that co-accused/Appellant Daulat Khan as against
each of them there is no direct or ocular evidence in
field except mere oral assertion of the co-accused
which too has not been proved by the prosecution
during the course of trial coupled with the fact that
these accused though remained in police custody for

sufficient length of time but there is no confession

pot nor any incriminating recoveries on their part. Thus,
ams

they have been rightly extended the benefit of doubt
by the learned Trial Court through the impugned
judgment, which to their extent calls for no

interference by this Court being perfect on all counts.

Nawab (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

15; Even otherwise, it is the duty of the
prosecution to prove its case beyond any shadow of
doubt and now it has been settled by the Hon'ble
Apex Court that a single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt is sufficient for acquittal of the
accused and if any single and slightest doubt is
created, its benefit must go to the accused, so, the
learned Trial court has rightly extended the benefit of
doubt to these accused on valid and cogent reasons
based on proper appreciation of evidence and their
acquittal does not call for any interference by this
Court. Moreover, criterion of appraisal of evidence
in an appeal against acquittal is quite different than
an appeal against conviction, because in case of
acquittal double presumption of innocence lies in
favour of the accused. Even if another view is
possible, the view favourable to the accused is to be
preferred. Reliance in this regard can be placed on

the case of Muhammad Igbal_vs. Abid Hussain

alias Mithu_and_ 6 others, 1994 _SCMR_ 1928.

Learned Astt: Advocate General appearing on behalf
of the State failed to point out any misreading or
non-reading of the evidence on record and on the

contrary the evidence was appreciated and assessed

on the settled principles of law by the learned Trial
Court to the extent of these acquitted
accused/Respondents.

16. In view of the above observations, the
appeal against acquittal preferred by the State
bearing No. 241-M of 2015 being shorn of merits
stands dismissed. Likewise, another criminal appeal
bearing No. 240-M/2015 filed by the State for
enhancement of the conviction and _ sentences
awarded to the accused/Respondent Daulat Khan is

hereby dismissed having become infructuous.
