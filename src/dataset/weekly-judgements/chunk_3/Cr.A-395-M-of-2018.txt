sentences recorded vide judgment dated
17.12.2018 of the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-1 Dir Upper, whereby they have

been sentenced as follows;

Accused/appellant Neor Ul Haq:

2. FIR No. 89 dated 23.04.2017 under
sections 302,31 1,322,496-A PPC read with
section 15 of Arms Act, 2013, has been registered
at police station Kalkot District Dir Upper on the
basis of “Murasila’ sent by Bahader Zaib Khan,
ASI. On receipt of information that a lady had
been killed in the name of honour at village
Beshoo, the ASI proceeded to the place of

occurrence along with other members of the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr, Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wigar Ahmad
police party whose names were mentioned
therein. He found dead body of the deceased
namely Mst. Hajira Bibi, in the house of
appellant Noor Ul Haq. Complainant namely
Qasim Jan who was present there, lodged report
of the occurrence, by stating that the deceased
Mst. Hajira Bibi had been his daughter. She was
stated to have married the appellant (his nephew)
namely Noor Ul Haq in the month of December
last. The other appellant namely Zakir Ullah was
alleged to have enticed her away on 22.04.2017
at 23:55 hours, Appellant Noor Ul Haq was
stated to have chased and found both of them at
11:00 P.M and fired at them, as a result of which
Mst. Hajira Bibi got hit and died on the spot,
while appellant Zakir Ullah escaped from the
scene. The unlawful act of Zakir Ullah was stated
to have been root cause of the occurrence, which
was also witnessed by Ahmad Jan and one
Musafir.

3. Investigation in the case ensued.
Blood soaked earth (Ex-P-3) has been recovered
from the spot vide recovery memo Ex. PC/3
along with empty shell of 30 pistol vide recovery

NAWAB {D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
memo Ex. PC/4. A 30 bore pistol (Ex. P-2) was
also shown to have been recovered on pointation —
of the appellant namely Noor Ul Haq vide
recovery memo Ex. PC/2. Same was also sent to
Regional Forensic Science Laboratory
(hereinafter referred to as “RFSL”) for the
purpose of matching it with the empty recovered
from the spot, report whereof was received in
affirmative (Ex. PK/3).
4. | On completion of investigation in the
case, complete challan was put in Court. Separate
charge was framed against both the accused on
20.11.2017, whereafter prosecution was invited to
produce evidence. Prosecution examined ten (10)
witnesses and closed its evidence. Statements of
the accused were recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C. On conclusion of proceedings in trial,
accused/appellants were convicted for commission
of the offences vide judgment dated 17.12.2018 of
the Court of learned Additional Sessions-1 Dir
Upper, as stated earlier.

Accused/appellants impugned their
convictions and sentences through the instant

appeals.

NAWAB {0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5. . Learned counsel for appellants
submitted during the course of their arguments
that there has been no direct evidence with the
prosecution against the appellants and mere fact
that the deceased had been killed by her husband
namely Noor Ul Haq on the alleged pretext of
honour could not be treated to be a circumstance
sufficient to connect the appellant with
commission of the offence. He placed reliance
upon judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court rendered,
in the case of “Nazeer Ahmad v/s The State”
reported as 2016 SCMR 1628, in the case of
“Nasrullah alias Nasro v/s The State” reported
as 2017 SCMR 724 and the case of “Muhammad
Pervaiz v/s The State and others” reported as
“PLD 2019 Supreme Court 592”. The learned
counsel further stated that recovery of weapon of
offence i.e. 30 bore pistol on pointation of the
appellant Noor Ul Haq was not believable as the
Investigating Officer had kept crime empty in
wait for recovery of pistol and had not sent it to
RFSL immediately, which fact vitiated the

evidentiary value of matching report of RFSL.

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
6. Learned State counsel relied upon
judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court, in the case of
“Arshad Mehmood w/s The State” reported as
2005 SCMR 1524, the case of “Saeed Ahmad v/s
The State” reported as 2015 SCMR 710 and
submitted that when the deceased was murdered
by the appellant Noor Ul Haq on the pretext of
honour, and he could not offer any explanation
for such a murder, the Court would be justified in
drawing an inference against him under Article
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. He
also supported the conviction and sentence
awarded to appellant namely Zakir Ullah by the
learned _ trial Court through the impugned
judgment.

7, : We have heard arguments of
learned counsel for the parties, learned
State counsel appearing on behalf of State and
perused the record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that the
spot of occurrence has been shown as a
thoroughfare leading towards village Beshoo at
a place known as Damazai (¢.5 ~*), in the site
plan. Investigating Officer had recovered blood

NAWAB (0.8) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
soaked earth and an empty of 30 bore pistol
therefrom. Complainant namely Qasim Jan
has been examined as PW-1 in the case in
hand, who disowned his story as narrated in
first report of the occurrence. In his
examination-in-chief he stated that it was
appellant Zakir Ullah who had enticed and
taken away the deceased Hajira Bibi and had
killed her subsequently. He also stated that the
appellant Noor Ul Haq had been innocent.
PW-2 namely Muhammad Ayub had deposed
regarding recovery of wearing apparel of the
deceased as well as the fact that appellant
Zakir Ullah had made pointation of the spot of
occurrence. Similarly, Lal Muhammad
Constable No. 1311 has testified in support of
recovery of 30 bore pistol from a place shown
in the recovery memo Ex. PC/2 on pointation
of appellant Noor Ul Haq. Investigation
Officer has been examined as PW-6 who has
mainly narrated the steps taken in
investigation of the case, which included

recovery of an empty from the spot, recovery of

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
pistol on pointation of appellant Noor Ul Haq,
sending it to RFSL for the purpose of
comparison and receipt of its report (Ex. PK/3)
which was found matching with an empty
recovered from the spot. The doctor who had
conducted external examination of the deceased
was examined as PW]. Lodger of the report
namely ‘Bahader Zaib Sub Inspector was
examined as PW-8 who has narrated the story as
mentioned in the FIR. Prosecution witness
mentioned in first report of the occurrence
namely Ahmad Jan was examined as PW-9, but
he also ‘tesiled from his earlier statement and
stated that local police had acquired his
signature on a blank paper. He was declared as
hostile witness and prosecution was allowed to
cross-examine him, who was accordingly cross-
examined. During his cross-examination he had
been disowning the statement shown to have
been got recorded by him under section 161
Cr.P.C. Similar was the case with other
prosecution witness namely Musafar Khan, who
had also resiled from his statement recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C. He was also declared

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
as hostile witness but during his cross-
examination nothing beneficial could be
brought out from his mouth.

9. From the above reproduced survey
of the evidence recorded by prosecution, it is
evident that no direct evidence of the occurrence
is available. So far as the appellant namely
Noor Ul Haq, is concerned, the PWs mentioned
in the first report have not supported contents of
the report. All the three eyewitnesses have
resiled from their earlier statements. The
prosecution is then left with circumstantial
evidence. The circumstantial evidence in the
case has not been found netted together. It
comprised of mostly isolated pieces of evidence
which could not be considered as sufficient for
connecting the appellant namely Noor Ul Haq
with commission of the offence.

10. The only piece of evidence that
prosecution may rely, in the given situation, has
been recovery of a 30 bore pistol on pointation
of appellant Noor Ul Haq and its matching
report with the empty shown recovered from the
spot. An empty of 30 bore pistol has been

NAWAB {D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

recovered from the spot on 23.04.2017 vide
recovery memo Ex. PC/4, A 30 bore pistol was
shown recovered on pointation of appellant
namely Noor Ul Haq on 27.05.2017 vide
recovery memo Ex. PC/2. Both the empty and
pistol have been sent to RFSL on 01.06.2017.
Report received therefrom and produced in
evidence as Ex. PK/3, no doubt shows that the
empty had been fired from the pistol sent to’
RFSL, but such a report cannot be relied upon
as the empty had not earlier been sent to RFSL
and had been kept’ by the Investigating Officer
in wait of recovery of the 30 bore pistol,
whereafter both the empty and pistol had been
sent to RFSL together at much belated stage.
Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of “Israr Ali v/s
The State” reported as “2007 SCMR 525” have
found such a delay in sending of empty to the
laboratory as vitiating the force of a matching
report of the laboratory. Relevant findings of
the august Court, in this respect, are reproduced

hereunder for ready reference;

Crime empty was not sent to the expert
immediately after taking into possession and

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
yd

-ll-

the weapon of offence was recovered from
the convict/appellant after his arrest as borne
out from the statement of P.W.16. P.W.15,
He also admitted that he did not send crime
empty to expert (till 1-12-1999. Khadim
Hussain P.W.4 stated in examination-in-
chief that he received parcel containing
empty bullet on 3-11-1999 from Muhammad
Akhtar P.W.14.. He -handed over to
Muhammad = Ramzan for onward
transmission in the office of Forensic
Science Laboratory. P.W.16 Khalid Rauf
arrested appellant on 5-12-1999. He also got
recovered the pistol from him on his
pointation. Thereafter he had handed over
pistol to P.W.4 Khadim Hussain. This type of
recovery of crime empty does not provide
strong corroboration qua the prosecution
version.”

Further reliance in this respect
may be also placed on judgment of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Jehangir v/s Naz ar_Farid_and_another”
reported as “2002 SCMR 1986”.

Recovery of the pistol and its
matching report with 30 bore empty shell
cannot therefore be relied upon safely. Besides,
there has been no reliable evidence against the
appellant namely Noor Ul Haq on the basis of
which his conviction by the learned trial Court
for an offence carrying a capital punishment,
may be justified, and maintained.

11. No doubt Hon’ble Apex Court has

held in its judgment in the case of “Saeed

NAWAB {D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqer Ahmad
ry

-12-

Ahmad Wh The State” reported as 2015 SCMR
710 that with regard to vulnerable members of
society, such as children, women arid the infirm,
who were living with the accused or were last
seen in his company the accused ought to offer
some explanation of what happened to them. If
instead he remains silent or offers a false
explanation he casts a shadow upon himself.
But it has also been noted therein that it did not
mean that the burden of proof had shifted on to
the accused as it is for the prosecution to prove
its case, however, in respect of the helpless or
weak that require protection or care it would not
be sufficient for the accused to stay silent in
circumstances which tend to incriminate him.
Ratio of the judgment of Saeed Ahmad Supra
cannot however be applied to the case in hand
for the reason that prosecution have not been
able to discharge its onus as explained above.
Initial burden of proof always lies on the
prosecution, which though may get shifted to
accused under Article 122 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order 1984, under circumstances .
justifying such shifting of burden, but in the

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahtm
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

case in hand, it is noticeable that prosecution
has not been able, even to discharge its initial
burden of proof. Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the case of ‘“Nasrullah alias Nasro
W/s The State” reported as 2017 SCMR 724 had

observed, in this respect;

“ It has been argued by the learned counsel for

the complainant that in the cases of Arshad
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR 1524) and
Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015 SCMR 710) this
Court had held that where a wife of a person or any
vulnerable dependent dies an unnatural death in the
house of such person then some part of the onus lies
on him to establish the circumstances in which such
unnatural death had occurred. The learned counsel
for the complainant has maintained that the stand
taken by the appellant regarding suicide having been
committed by the deceased was neither established
by him nor did it fit into the circumstances of the
case, particularly when the medical evidence
contradicted the same. Be that as it may holding by
this Court that some part of the onus lies on the
accused person in such a case does not mean that
the entire burden of proof shifts to the accused
person in a case of this nature. It has already been
clarified by this Court in the case of Abdul Majeed v.
The State (2011 SCMR 941) that the prosecution is
bound to prove its case against an accused person
beyond reasonable doubt at all stages of a criminal
case and in a case where the prosecution asserts
presence of some eye-witnesses and such claim of
the prosecution is not established by it there the
accused person could not be convicted merely on the
basis of a presumption that since the murder of his
wife had taken place in his house, therefore, it must
be he and none else who would have committed that
murder.”

A somewhat similar findings have
also been recorded by Hon’ble Apex Court in its

judgment in the case of “Nazeer Ahmad v/s The

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
ry

-14-

State” reported as 2016 SCMR 1628, which are
reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“It may be true that when a vulnerable dependant is
done to death inside the confines of a house,
particularly during a night, there some part of the
onus lies on the close relatives of the deceased to
explain as to how their near one had met an
unnatural death but where the prosecution utterly
fails to prove its own case against an accused person
there the accused person cannot be convicted on the
sole basis of his failure to explain the death. These
aspects of the legal issue have been commented upon
by this Court in the cases of Arshad Mehmood v.
The State (2005 SCMR 1524), Abdul Majeed v. The
State (2011 SCMR 941) and Saeed Ahmed v. The
State (2015 SCMR 710).”

Likewise, in the case of

“Muhammad Jamsheed and _ another v/s The

State_and_ others” reported as 2016 SCMR
1019, Hon’ble Apex Court had observed that
suspicion howsoever grave or strong could
never be a proper substitute for proof, beyond
reasonable doubt, required in a criminal case.

12. So far as the case of appellant in
criminal appeal No. 26-M of 2019 namely
Zakir Ullah, is concerned, it is noticeable that
complainant namely Qasim Jan stated in his
first report that Zakir Ullah had enticed away
the deceased Mst. Hajira Bibi for the purpose
illicit intercourse, which became root cause of;
her death at the hands of Noor U] Hag, his son.

NAWAB " (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-15-

While appearing in Court as PW-1 he took a
totally different stance and stated that the lady
had been enticed away and killed by appellant
‘

Zakir Ullah. Learned trial Court has relied upon
statement of this witness for holding that
appellant Zakir Ullah had been seen by him
while enticing away the deceased Hajira Bibi at
the time of her death. Statement of this witness
has not been of any worth, due to the fluctuating
stances he has been offering during the course
of investigation and then trial of the case.
Besides him there has been no evidence against
the appellant that the lady had been enticed
away or killed by the appellant namely Zakir
Ullah. Prosecution have not been able to prove
case against him beyond reasonable doubt.

13. In light what has been discussed
above, convictions and sentences of the two
appellants recorded by learned trial Court vide
its judgement dated 17.12.2018, in the instant
case, are set aside by allowing both the appeals
and extending benefit of doubts to the respective
appellants. These were reasons for our short

orders of even date whereby both the appellants

have been directed to be released from jail, if
not required in any other case.
