has been filed by complainant, whereas criminal
revision No. 98-M/2019 filed by the State for
enhancement of the sentence awarded to appellant
namely Muhammad Zaman alias Kotay to that of death

penalty.

3. FIR in the case in hand has been
registered on the basis of Murasila Ex PA. Contents of
the Murasila reveal that during investigation of case
FIR No. 466 dated 30.10.1994 registered under
sections 302/34 PPC at Police Station Kabal,
complainant namely Mst. Zaiba wife of Dalilullah had
lodged report of the present occurrence stating therein
that she had been busy in cultivating onions along with
her father-in-law namely Khalilullah as well as her
husband namely Daililullah in their field at about 09:00
AM. Accused Ayub Khan and Muhammad Zaman

(present appellant), (who had been armed with

Abdut Sabooh/* {D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
3.

firearm), appeared in the meanwhile and started firing

at father-in-law and husband of the complainant. From
firing of the appellant, both father-in-law and husband
of the complainant died at the spot. The occurrence
was also claimed to have been witnessed by Mst.
Zahida wife of Habibullah, who had got attracted to the
spot on hearing sound of fire shots. Previous strained
relations were stated to have been motive for
commission of the offence and accordingly both the

accused were charged in the first report.

4. Initially, challan under section 512 Cr. PC
had been submitted against the present appellant as he |

had gone in absconsion after commission of

the offerice. Thereafter, proceedings under section 512

Cr. PC had also been initiated against him by the
learned trial Court and later on, he had been declared
proclaimed offender by the learned Sessions Judge

Shangla at Camp Court, Swat vide his order dated

~ 21.10.2000. Upon arrest of the appellant, further

investigation was also conducted by the Investigating
Officer in the case in hand. The Investigating Officer
had earlier obtained injury sheets as well as autopsy
reports of the two deceased. Beside other proceedings
in investigation, weapon of offence was also produced
by one Sher Afzal Khan, which was taken in

possession by the local police vide recovery memo Ex
PW 2/5. Six empties had been recovered from the spot.
FSL report regarding comparison of the empties with
rifle was also received and placed on record as Ex PZ.
On completion of investigation in the case,
supplementary challan was put in Court against the
present appellant. The prosecution examined nine (09)
witnesses and closed their . evidence, whereafter
statement of the accused was also recorded under
section 342 Cr. PC. On conclusion of proceedings in
the trial, the accused/appellant namely Muhammad
Zaman was convicted and sentenced as reproduced

above vide impugned judgment dated 02.07.2019.

5. We have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, learned Asst:A.G appearing on

behalf of the State and perused the record.

6. Perusa of record reveals that prosecution
relied upon eye-witness account of the complainant
recorded as PW-4 as well as another eye-witness
namely Mst. Zahida recorded as PW-5. In her
examination-in-chief, complainant has stated that at
about 08/08:30am in the morning on the day of
occurrence, her husband and father-in-law had been
cultivating onions in their field, during which time she

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.} Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-5-

heard sounds of fire shots and climbed on the rooftop
of her house, where she saw acquitted co-accused
namely Ayub Khan, who killed her husband and came
towards her. She tried to catch him but he released
himself and thereafter made firing on her father-in-law
and also killed him. She further stated that at the time
of occurrence, brother of her husband namely Naik
Amal as well as his son namely Said Ali Shah have
also been present in their field. The accused was also
alleged to have made firing on brother of husband of
the complainant. Almost at the end of her examination-
in-chief, she has stated that Muhammad Zaman
(present appellant) had also been present at the spot
and made firing at her husband and father-in-law. She
also stated that she had been having no knowledge
about the motive that existed on part.of the two
accused, for commission of the offence. In her cross-
examination, she admitted it correct that on the day of
occurrence, brother of accused namely Ayub Khan as
well as his maternal uncle had also been killed. She has
also stated in her cross-examination that she had
climbed the rooftop of her house after three minutes of
the firing and that all the firing had been made in one

go. She also admitted that it was correct that parties

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-6-

have effected a compromise later on, in pursuance to

which bail had been granted to all the accused.

7. It is astonishing that the complainant has
changed her version in her examination-in-chief from
the one given while lodging first report of the
occurrence. The changed variations offered by the
witness was tried to be explained by learned counsel
for complainant by stating that her statement had been
recorded after 24 years of the occurrence and therefore
she might have forgotten the actual story and that the
difference between the two versions has been minor
variation, which might be ignored. But it is difficult to
be agreed with learned counsel for complainant. The
variations in the two accounts have not been minor in
nature rather the main story of commission of the
offence has been changed. The role of effective firing
had earlier been attributed to the appellant at the time
of lodging first report of the occurrence, which had
subsequently been changed to that of the acquitted
co-accused namely Ayub Khan. One of the reasons
might be a fact that the appellant had been absconding
while the other co-accused had earlier been arrested
and had been facing trial. In his trial, complainant had
shifted the effective role of causing death of the two
deceased to him. She has reiterated the same stance

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
* Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-7-
while appearing during trial of the appellant. Not only

this, she has also given divergent accounts of her own
presence. In the FIR she has stated that she had been
busy in cultivating onions in their field along with her
husband and father-in-law but subsequently in her
Court statement, she has shown her presence inside her
house and then climbing the rooftop, three minutes
after hearing the fire shots. Same was the case with
motive which has specifically been alleged in first
report but had then been disowned by the complainant
while recording her examination-in-chief in the Court.
Such variations cannot be treated as minor in nature.
There is a sea of difference between the two accounts,
which cannot be justified by taking the plea of lapse of
memory. Evidence in a case of capital charge must
come from unimpeachable source or to be supported
by strong circumstances that might remove inherent
doubt attaching to evidence of interested or partisan
witness, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of

Pakistan in its judgment given in the case of Thoba

and _ Another vs. The State reported as PLD 1963
Supreme Court 40. When a witness is found to be
telling lies on an important point having material
bearing on culpability of the accused, as held by this

Court in its judgment given in the case of Faridullah

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-8-
Shah and another _vs. The State reported as 1990

P Cr. LJ 1945, his evidence could not be attached any

credence. In the case of Muhammad Achar ys. The

State reported as 1991 P Cr. LJ 522, Hon’ble Karachi

High Court has held that witnesses having no respect
for truth and being capable of changing their versions
as and when it suited them, were worthy of no
credence, even if they were found to be natural
witnesses. Relevant part of observation of the august

Court is reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“The witnesses having no respect for truth
and being capable of changing their versions,
as and when it suited to them are worthy of
no credence even if they are found to be
natural witnesses. The dictum laid down in
Akbar Shah v. The State reported as PLJ
1974 (Lahore) 84, is to be followed while
appreciating evidence of such witnesses in the
given circumstances.”

The variation. of version made by the
complainant during trial of the instant case has
changed the entire complexion of the case of
prosecution and same cannot be termed to be minor

lapses on any dent of imagination.

8. The other witness ie. PW-5 has also
stated in her examination-in-chief that on hearing the
fire shot, she had climbed the rooftop of their house
along with Mst. Zaiba (complainant), where they had

seen the acquitted accused namely Ayub Khan and

Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-9-
Muhammad Zaman (present appellant) making firing

at brother of her husband and her father-in-law,
whereafter they decamped from the spot. She has also
stated that she knew nothing about the motive for
commission of the offence. The complainant had
though stated in her Court statement that this PW
namely Mst. Zahida had also got attracted to the spot
on hearing fire shots but she has not stated that this PW
had climbed the rooftop along with her at the relevant
time. In the site plan also, both the witnesses have been
shown at a distance from each other and none of them
have been shown at the rooftop of their house. The
description of occurrence as given by the complainant,
attributing a specific role of causing death of the two
deceased to a particular accused, has not been stated in
same manner by this PW and in this respect, the
accounts of occurrence offered by the two witnesses
have not been one and the same. In such
circumstances, this witness who has also been closely

related to the deceased is not believable.

9, When the eye-witness account of the
prosecution has been disbelieved, then rest of the
witnesses have mainly been formal in nature and their
testimony need not be discussed. No recovery or
discovery has been effected from or on pointation of

ee
Abdul Sabooh/* (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

the accused/appellant. The medical evidence is also of
no help to the case of prosecution in the given

circumstances.

10. In light of what has been discussed above,
it is held that prosecution have failed in proving the
case against appellant beyond reasonable doubt. On
allowing of the appeal in hand, the impugned judgment
is set aside and the appellant is acquitted of the charges
leveled against him on extending him benefit of doubt.
He be released forthwith, if not required in any other

case.

ll. Since, criminal appeal No. 309-M/2019
against conviction was allowed and the appellant
in conviction appeal was acquitted of the
charges, therefore both the criminal revisions in
hand have become infructuous and same are

accordingly disposed of.

12. These are reasons for our short order of

even date, which read as;

“For reasons to be recorded later, we allow
this appeal, set-aside the judgment of
conviction dated 02.07.2019 passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-
Til/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court Swat
in case FIR No. 467 dated 30.10.1994
registered under sections 302, 34 PPC at
police station Kabal District Swat and
resultantly acquit the appellant namely
Muhammad Zaman alias Kotay of the

charges leveled against him. He be released
