SHAHID KHAN, J.- Through captioned

appeal, Amir Mehmood, hereinafter, the
appellant/accused, has called in question legality
& validity of his conviction through the
judgment, dated, 15.7.2022, of learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Banda Daud Shah,
Karak, whereby, on conclusion of trial, in case
FIR No.109, dated, 23.11.2018, under Sections
302/324 PPC, of police station Khurram, Banda

Daud Shah, Karak, recorded his conviction
ye

-2-

under Sections 302(b) PPC and sentenced him
for life imprisonment with compensation of
Rs.5,00,000/- under Section 544-A Cr.PC, or in
default thereof to further undergo six months
simple imprisonment. He was further convicted
& sentenced under Section 324 PPC for five
years imprisonment with fine in the sum of
Rs.50,000/-, or in default thereof to further
undergo simple imprisonment for six months.
Both the sentences shall run concurrently.
However, benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was

extended accordingly.

2. The complainant has also filed
Cr.Rev.No.43-B/2022 for enhancement of
sentence of the appellant and the amount of
compensation under Section 544-A Cr.PC, both
these matters, being the outcome of one and
same trial, therefore, are to be disposed of by

way of this single judgment.

3. The prosecution’s case, as set forth
in the crime report, is that on the fateful date,
day & time (23.11.2018 at about 1100 hours),
complainant Mst. Kausar Parveen, in the

company of her son Shaheed-ur-Rahman and co-
-3-

villagers, brought the dead body of her father-in-
law Aziz-ur-Rahman, in a Pick-up, to the police
station Khurram, Karak and reported the matter
to the effect that on the eventful day, she with
her son Shaheed-ur-Rahman and deceased
father-in-law were irrigating their fields. At
about 0945 hours, appellant/accused Amir
Mehmood, equipped with firearm, came there
and started firing at them with intention to
commit their Qatl-e-Amd, as a result of it, Aziz-
ur-Rahman got hit and died on the spot, whereas,
the complainant and her son, luckily, escaped
unhurt. After the occurrence, the appellant/
accused fled away. Motive for the occurrence is

alleged to be nonpayment of debt of the shop.

4. On completion of the investigation,
challan was drawn within the meaning of
Section 173 Cr.PC and after doing the needful, it
was sent up to the Court of competent

jurisdiction for trial accordingly.

5. On commencement of trial, copies
of the evidence (oral and documentary) were
delivered to the appellant/accused within the

meaning of Section 265-C Cr.PC, followed by,
-4-

confronted him with the set of allegations
through a formal charge. He denied the subject

allegations, pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

6. The prosecution, to bring home
charge against the appellant/accused, produced
twelve (12) witnesses to substantiate its version.
At the closure of the prosecution’s account, the
appellant/accused was confronted with the
evidence so furnished through formal
questionnaires within the meaning of Section
342 Cr.PC, to which he professed innocence and
claimed to have been falsely implicated in the
subject case. However, he neither wished to be
examined on Oath as required under Section
340(2) Cr.PC nor intended to produce evidence
in defence. On conclusion of trial, scanning of
record with due assistance of learned counsel for
the parties and learned prosecutor, the learned
trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Banda
Daud Shah, Karak, arrived at the conclusion that
the prosecution has successfully proved its case
against the appellant/accused without any

shadow of doubt, hence, vide impugned
-5-

judgment, dated, 15.7.2022, recorded his

conviction, as referred to above.

7. We have heard the arguments of the
learned counsel for the parties as well as learned
Addl: A.G. representing the State and have gone

through the record of the case.

8. It is an established principle of law
that each & every criminal case has its own
peculiar facts and circumstances and the same
seldom coincide with each other on salient
features. Admittedly, it is an unfortunate
incident in which father-in-law of the
complainant, namely, Aziz-ur-Rahman lost his
life after sustaining firearm injuries but to put
the facts and circumstances in equilibrium with
the touchstone of safe administration of justice,
the Court has scrutinized the entire evidence
made available on record while weighing the
same on judicial parlance. It has been observed
by the Court that the prosecution has led
evidence in the shape of ocular, medical &
circumstantial evidence, as well as
investigation besides other attending

circumstances.
-6-

9. The ocular account is consisted of
the statements of the complainant, Mst. Kausar
Parveen (PW-7) and Shaheed-ur-Rahman (PW-
8). According to the aforesaid PWs of the
ocular account, the appellant/accused duly
equipped with firearm made firing at them, as a
result of it, the deceased Aziz-ur-Rahman got

hit and died on the spot.

10. PW-7 & PW-8 closely related to
the deceased Aziz-ur-Rahman, as PW-7 is her
daughter-in-law and PW-8 is his grandson,
therefore, their evidence has to be appreciated
with due care & caution. No doubt, the
evidence of the closed related witnesses cannot
be discarded on the mere ground of their
relation with the victim but if, it is found that
testimony of the related witnesses do not find
corroboration from attending circumstances of
the event or the conduct & demeanor
demonstrated by them at the time of
occurrence or just thereafter, as such, the same
shall not be expected from a prudent person,
then under such circumstances the evidence

furnished by related witnesses is hard to be
-7-

accepted. At the touchstone of the above, we
now take into consideration the testimony
furnished by the prosecution consists of the

PW-7 & PW-8.

11. The presence of PW-7 & PW-8 is
doubtful at the place of occurrence. The
alleged occurrence took place on 23.11.2018 at
0945 hours, the in between distance of the
place of occurrence and the police station
Khurram, Karak is about 10/12 kilometers,
whereas, the FIR has been lodged on the same
day at 1100 hours, i.e. after a delay of one hour
and fifteen minutes. On this score alone, strong
presumption can no way be ruled out regarding

the element of consultation and deliberation.

12. PW-8 stated that he and his mother
(PW-7) reached first to the deceased after the
accused decamped. PW-3 reduced the report of
the complainant (PW-7) in the shape of FIR
Ex.PW-3/1, duly verified by PW-8. He also
prepared injury sheet Ex.PW-3/2 and inquest
report Ex.PW-3/3. Admittedly, PW-7 and PW-
8 are not the identifiers of the dead body of the

deceased before the local police as well as
-8-

before the doctor, rather it was identified by
PW-4 Azizullah, Musadiq ur Rahman and
Aziz-ur-Rahman son of Abdur Rahman,
ironically, the subject witnesses other than
Azizullah have not been produced. Admittedly,
PW-4, Musadiq ur Rahman and Aziz-ur-
Rahman son of Abdur Rahman are not the
eyewitnesses of the occurrence. Similarly, PW-
7 & PW-8 on their turn stated in their
respective statements that after lodging the
report in the police station they proceeded to
their house, whereas, the deceased was taken to
the hospital. PW-7 stated that due to grief she
had not counted the number of fire shots made
by the accused upon them. The caliber of
weapon is also not mentioned in the FIR. PW-8
stated in his examination-in-cross that the
accused was armed with Kalashnikov and he
was acquainted with the same. He stated that
the report was read over to him but he had not
disclosed to the police that the accused was
armed with Kalashnikov. Non disclosure of
kind and bore of the weapon used in the
commission of the offence despite the fact that

PW-8 could identify the arms with its bores is
ne

-9-

a strong circumstance which makes his
presence at the fateful time on the scene of

occurrence is highly doubtful.

13. Per statements of PW-7 & PW-8,
Musadiq and Abdul Nawaz attracted to the spot
after 6/7 minutes of the occurrence and
thereafter many others also attracted to the spot.
Musadiq arranged the cot and the dead body of
the deceased was shifted to the police station in
vehicle of Idrees by PW-7, PW-8, Musadiq,
Azizullah and Abdul Nawaz. However, the
Idrees, driver of the vehicle, Musadiq and Abdul
Nawaz have not been produced as witnesses
during the trial. If, they could furnish their
account it would have strengthened the case of
the prosecution; but not to produce them as
prosecution witnesses, it has adversely affected
its case in view of the provisions of Article 129,
Illustration (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. It is now settled law not to produce
material witnesses, an inference can be drawn
that had they stepped into the witness box, they
would have not supported the prosecution’s

case. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in
gc

-10-

the case of “Muhammad Rafique and others v.
State and others” (2010 SCMR 385) held as
under:-
"that if any party withholds the best
piece of evidence then it can fairly be
presumed that the party had some
sinister motive behind it. The
presumption under Article 129(g) of
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order can fairly
be drawn that if PW would have been
examined, his evidence would have
been unfavourable to the
prosecution".
14. Similarly, due particulars of the
vehicle, as its registration number, kind & type,
colour etc, are neither part & parcel of the
investigation nor that of the trial. While
proceeding to the police station, it has been
fairly conceded that the blood of the deceased
was oozing in the vehicle but strangely enough,
the subject circumstantial evidence is not part &
parcel of the investigation followed by the trial.
The Investigation Officer for the reasons best
known to him has not collected the signs and
symptoms of the subject circumstantial evidence
from the rear portion of the vehicle through

which the victim was shifted to the police

station. The doctor (PW-1) stated in his
Be

-ll-

examination-in-cross that according to his
report, the injury sheet, postmortem report and
bloodstained garments of the deceased were
handed over to the police on 29.11.2018, PW-12
escorted the dead body to the hospital on
23.11.2018. He pointed out in his examination-
in-cross that on the same day the bloodstained
garments and post-mortem documents, etc were
handed over to him and he further delivered the
same to the I.O at about 03:30 hours. Similar is
the statement of PW-1 who is marginal witness

of recovery memo Ex.PW-1/1.

15. Weapon of offence i.e. Kalashnikov
has been recovered on the pointation of the
appellant/accused from his house vide recovery
memo Ex.PW-2/9. It was sent to the FSL with
previously recovered four crime empties of 7.62
bore and in this regard, the report Ex.PW-2/12
shows that the crime empties were fired from the
same local made 7.62 bore rifle (smg). However,
the prosecution has not complied the
requirements of Section 103 Cr.P.C as the
alleged Kalashnikov was recovered from the

house of the appellant/accused, but no
-12-

independent witness was associated with the
process of recovery and even lady constable was
not associated for the subject purpose in order to
respect the sanctity of chaddar & chardewari, as
such, the recovery of the weapon of offence so
alleged and presented by the prosecution is

prima facie tainted with doubts.

16. Other than the above, the alleged
recovered weapon of offence has not been
substantiated to be registered with the quarter
concerned in the name of the appellant/accused
and no pain, whatsoever, has been taken to
confirm the factum of its ownership, therefore,
the possibility to plant the subject weapon
against the appellant/accused can no way be
ruled out. Besides, in case titled, “Saifullah v.
The State" (1985 SCMR 410), it has been
ruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that:-
"When there is no eye-witness to be
relied upon, then there is nothing,
which can be corroborated by the
recovery".
17. The nonpayment of debt has been
alleged as motive for the occurrence in respect

of a grocery shop. However, the 1.0 (PW-9)
-B-

stated in his examination-in-cross that the
complainant party has neither produced the
debt register nor he asked about it during his
investigation, therefore, it could safely be
concluded that prosecution could not be able to
prove the motive part of the story. The
prosecution is not bound to setup motive in
each & every case but once, it is alleged and
not proved, then the ocular account is required
to be scrutinized with due care & caution. It
has been held in the case titled “Hakim Ali Vs.
The State” (1971 SCMR_ 432), that the
prosecution though not called upon to establish
motive in every case, yet once it has setup a
motive and failed to establish, the prosecution

must suffer consequences and not the defence.

18. The medical evidence can no way
pin point the accused nor can establish the
identity of the accused. It is hard fact that
medical evidence can never be considered to be
a corroborative piece of evidence and at the most
can be considered a supporting evidence only to
the extent of specification of seat of injuries, the

weapon of offence, duration, the cause of death
ae

-14-

etc. “Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State” (2018
SCMR 772), “Tariq Hussain and another Vs.

The State and 04 others” (2018 MLD_1573

[Federal Shariat Court]).

19. So far as abscondence of the
appellant/accused is concerned, it is common
culture and tradition even in this part of
country that after a person is nominated as an
accused in a criminal case, irrespective of the
factum to has been nominated falsely or truly,
not only the nominated person even his other
family members, disappear from the scene and
avoid to appear till the patience, cooling period
for the reason as not to be targeted by the
members of the bereaved family. Other than it,
time and again, it is settled law that conviction
on abscondence alone cannot be sustained.

Reliance placed on “Amir Gul Vs. the State”

(1981 SCMR 182).

20. It is well settled law that accused
person is presumed to be innocent till the time
he is proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt
and this presumption of innocence continued

until the prosecution succeeded in proving the
Pp

-15-

charge against the accused beyond reasonable
doubt on the basis of legally admissible,
confidence inspiring, trustworthy and reliable
evidence. In the instant case, the prosecution
has failed to prove the guilt of the appellant

through the above standard of evidence.

21. Crux of the above discussion is
that the prosecution has miserably failed to
bring home guilt of the appellant through
cogent and confidence inspiring direct or
circumstantial evidence beyond shadow of
reasonable doubt. The prosecution's evidence
is pregnant with doubts and according to
golden principle of benefit of doubt; one
substantial doubt is enough for acquittal of the
accused. Reliance placed on case titled,

"Muhammad Zaman v. The State and others"

2014 SCMR 749).

22. There is no second opinion about
the fact that the elemental principle of justice
always laid emphasis on the quality of evidence
which must be of first degree and sufficient
enough to dispel the apprehension of the Court

with regard to the implication of the innocent
-16-

persons alongwith guilty one by the prosecution,
otherwise, the golden principle of justice would
come into play that even a single doubt, if, found
reasonable would be sufficient to record
acquittal of the accused, giving him/them benefit
of doubt becatise bundle of doubts are not
required at all to extend the legal benefit to the
accused. In this regard, reliance is placed on a
view held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the

case of "Riaz Masih alius Mithoo Vs. State

(NLR 1995 Cr.SC 694).

23. For the afore-stated reasons, the
subject appeal is accepted, the impugned
judgment, dated, 15.7.2022, of learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge, Banda Daud
Shah, Karak is set aside and the appellant/
accused Amir Mehmood is acquitted of the
charges levelled against him by extending the
benefit of doubt. He be set free forthwith, if not

required, in any other case.

24, Since the impugned judgment
regarding conviction of the appellant/accused
has been set aside, therefore, connected

Cr.Rev.No.43-B/2022 for enhancement of his
sentence has become infructuous and dismissed
as such.
25. By our short order of even date, we

had accepted the appeal of the appellant Amir
Mehmood and acquitted him of the charges
levelled against him. Hereinabove are reasons
for the same.
