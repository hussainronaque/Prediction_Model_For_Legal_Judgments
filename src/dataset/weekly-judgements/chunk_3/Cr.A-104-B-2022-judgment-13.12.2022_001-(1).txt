SHAHID KHAN, J.—- The appellant Nawab Khan assailed
the judgment dated 13.06.2022, passed by the learned
Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat, whereby he was convicted
under section 302(b) PPC ‘and sentenced to life
imprisonment as Tazir with fine of Rs.3,00,000/- as
compensation to the legal heirs of deceased within the
meaning of section 544-A Cr.PC or in default whereof to
undergo six months SI. Benefit of section 382 P.P.C was
also extended to the appellant vide FIR No.172 dated
06.05.2019 U/S 302 PPC of Police Station Ghazni Khel,
Lakki Marwat. :

2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has questioned the

legality of the impugned judgrrent and the awarded
-2-

sentence through the instant appeal, whereas, Muzafar
Abbas, son of the deceased, and Ali Sardar, brother of the
deceased, being aggrieved of the quantum of sentence have
moved Criminal Revision Petition No.35-B of 2022 for
enhancement of the same. Since both these matters have
arisen out of the same judgment, therefore, we intend to
decide the same through this common judgment.

3. The transient facts as unfolded in the first
information report are that on 06.05.2019 at 11:15 hours,
complainant / injured Abdul Khaliq lodged a report to the
local police in emergency ward of DHQ Hospital, Lakki
Marwat to the effect that on the eventful day, he alongwith
his son Zafar Ali and Nawab Khan, his co-villager, were
jointly running the thresher in his house; that after
completion of work, Nawab Khan:went to his own house
and after some time, he (Nawab Khan) came back duly
armed with pistol; that the complainant carried a cot and
entered into his room; that at about 10:00 hours, accused
Nawab Khan also entered into the room and inquired if the
complainant had brought the Charpai (cot) inside the room;
that on complainant’s affirmative reply, accused Nawab
Khan shot him inside the room, as a result of which, he got
hit and fell down; that after the occurrence, accused
decamped from the spot; that there was no previous motive.

Report of the complainant / inju‘ed Abdul Khaliq wsa
-3- i

reduced in shape of murasila Ex.PA/1 which was sent to the
PS for registration of the case, on the basis of which, the
case was initially registered under section 324 PPC,
however, thereafter when the injured succumbed to his
injuries, the section of law was iltered from one under
section 324 PPC to 302 PPC.

4. Initially, the accused remained absconder, however,
after his arrest, supplementary challan was submitted
against him, where at the commencement of trial, the
prosecution produced and exam‘ned as many as 11
witnesses. On close of prosecution evidence, statement of
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein
he professed innocence and false implication, however,
neither he opted to be examined on oath as provided under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C nor wished to produce defence
evidence. After hearing arguments, the learned trial Court
vide the impugned judgment, convicted and sentenced the
appellant as mentioned above. Hence, the instant appeal
against the judgment of conviction and the criminal revision
for enhancement of the sentence:

5. | Arguments heard and record scanned through.

6. The deceased then injured after receiving firearm
injury was shifted to DHQ Hospital, Lakki Marwat, where
he reported the matter to the local police in respect of the

incident and charged the acctised / appellant for
-4-

commission of the offence. The police official after
examining the injured prepared the injury sheet and
thereafter, drafted the murasila and the deceased then
injured was sent to the doctor, fer medical examination,
under the escort of constable Bilal, The injured was
examined by the doctor and after his examination, the
medico legal certificate was prepared. After giving first aid
to the deceased then injured, he was referred to Civil
Hospital, Bannu for further treatment and as such, the
injured was shifted to Civil Hospital, Bannu. The murasila
was incorporated in the FIR and the investigating officer
after receiving copy of the FIR visited the spot and on
pointation of the eye witness, prepared the site plan. During
spot inspection, the investigating officer collected
bloodstained earth from the place of the deceased and also
recovered an empty of .30 bore pistol, the same was sent to
the firearms expert for ascertaining the fact that from which
bore the same was fired. The laboratory report in respect of
the bloodstained earth and the .30 bore pistol was received
and available on file. The investigating officer on the very
day of the incident recorded 161 Cr.P.C statement of the
eye witness namely Zafar Ali who happens to be the son of
the deceased. It is pertinent to mention that on the same
day, the deceased then injured breathed his last and as such,

section 302 PPC was inserted in the FIR and his dead body

i
-5-
was received in DHQ Hospital, Lakki Marwat, where the
inquest report was prepared and thereafter, the doctor
conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased.

7. The appellant was arrested on 27.02.2020, who led
the police party to the place of incident and after the expiry
of his physical custody, he was remitted to judicial lock up.
The trial commenced and on conclusion of the trial, the
learned trial Court was pleased to convict the appellant vide
the impugned judgment.

8. The record was scanned through with valuable
assistance of learned counsel for the parties and also the
worthy Additional Advocate General in order to see as to
whether the learned trial Court was justified to convict the
appellant and as to whether the learned trial judge
appreciated the available record in its true perspective. This
Court is to see as to whether the learned trial Court
appreciated the evidence on file; as to whether the
impugned judgment finds support from record of the case
and as to whether the conclusion drawn by the learned trial
judge is the outcome of the assessment of evidence on file
and the recorded statements of the witnesses. This being the
Court of appeal and is under the obligation to reassess the
already assessed evidence and to re-appreciate the evidence
once appreciated, so that miscarriage of justice could be

avoided. True that in the instant case, single accused is

\
e
x5

-6-

charged and that in case of singularly charged accused,
substitution is a rare phenomenon, but equally true that
mere this fact is not sufficient to relax the courts of law to
decide the fate of the accused charged with a preoccupied
mind, rather in case of a single’ accused, the responsibility
on the shoulders of both the trial as well as the appellate
Court is higher than ordinary cases. So, in the
circumstances of the present case, we are under the
obligation to revisit and rediscover the already visited and
discovered aspects of the case, so that miscarriage of justice
could be avoided.

9, | The moot questions to be answered by this Court are
as to whether the incident occurred in the mode, manner
and at the stated time; as to whether the deceased then
injured was capable to talk and that it was he who reported
the matter; as to whether the eye witness was present at the
crime scene at the time of occurrence and as to whether the
prosecution succeeded in bringing on record substantial
evidence to connect the appellant with the murder of the
deceased. There is no denial of the fact that the incident
occurred inside the residential room of the house of the
deceased and that the investigating officer, during spot
inspection, collected bloodstained earth and an empty of .30
bore, but the prosecution is yet to tell that it was only and

only the appellant, who killed the deceased and that the eye
,

-7-

witness was present at the time of incident. The record tells
that soon after receiving firearm injury, the deceased then
injured was shifted to DHQ Hospital Lakki Marwat where
he was examined by the doctor and his medico legal
certificate was prepared. It is evident from the record that
the injured was received by the doctor at 11:30 AM,
whereas, the report was made by the deceased then injured
at 11:15 AM to the local police, in the same hospital. The
record is silent as to who brought the deceased then injured
to the hospital and at what time. As the time of examination
of the injured by the doctor and the time when the matter
was reported to the local police are not in harmony with
each other, as when the doctor was examined as PW-05, he
stated that it was about 11:31 AM, when the deceased then
injured was produced by constable Bilal and by that time,
he was bleeding and that he examined the injured at 11:31
AM; he completed the examination of the injured in 30
minutes and thereafter, the deceased then injured was
referred to Civil Hospital Bannu. When the statement of the
doctor is taken into consideration with that of the scribe
who was examined as PW-04, both the witnesses
contradicted each other on material aspects of the case. The
scribe was examined as PW-04, who stated that on
receiving information regarding arrival of the injured to the

hospital, he reached there and at 11:15 AM where he
€

-8-

recorded the report of the complainant: that the injury sheet
was prepared and thereafter, thé murasila was drafted and
that after drafting the murasila, the deceased then injured
was shifted to the doctor under the escort of constable Bilal.
This witness further stated that it was in the emergency
room of the hospital that he took the report and the doctor
was also present. When the statements of these two
witnesses are taken into juxtaposition, it leads us to draw an
inference that neither the report’ was made in the manner
nor the injured was examined at the stated time. If we
consider the statement of PW-04 that he penned down the
report at 11:15 AM, prepared the injury sheet and shifted
the injured to the doctor, then we are to disbelieve the
statement of the doctor on that particular aspect of the case
and if we believe the doctor, then in that eventuality, it is
the scribe who is to lose his credibility. The doctor admitted
that the injured was examined at 11:31 AM and he also
admitted that it was 11:30 AM, when the injured was
brought to the hospital. If such is the state of affairs, then an
inference can be drawn that the medical examination of the
injured was conducted much earlier than the report was
made. If we calculate the time which the injured spent
before the doctor, it tells another story, as by 11:31 AM, the
doctor started his medical examination and it took him 30

minutes to conclude, so in such eventuality, the injured
yo,

-9-

remained before the doctor tell 12:01 PM, whereas, the
report was made at 11:15 AM. The doctor was cross
examined on this particular aspect of the case, who replied
in an unnatural tone as he stated thet he does not remember
as to whether the report was made by the injured to the
scribe in his presence or otherwise. The doctor did not
accept that when the injured was brought before him, the
concerned constable was also in possession of the injury
sheet and even, he did not admit that the report was made in
his presence. Another intriguing aspect of the case is that
the doctor in his court statement disclosed that the injured
remained under his custody from 11:30 AM to 12:01 PM
and thereafter, he was referred for specialized treatment to
Civil Hospital, Bannu; if such is tae state of affairs, then
there was no occasion for the scribe to have penned down
the report as it was after the medical examination, that the
report was made and when the doctor admitted that soon
after examination, the deceased then injured was referred to
Civil Hospital, Bannu, then it creates a mystery that at what
time the report was made and the injury sheet was prepared.
Another circumstance which invites the attention of this
court is the presence of eye witness Zafar Ali at the time of
incident and also at the time of report. The investigating
officer when visited the spot and :prepared the site plan,

there in the site plan, at point-No.2, the eye witness is
-10-

shown and surprisingly, the eye witness was examined by
the investigating officer under section 161 Cr.P.C at 16:00
hours, but at the time of report, neither the eye witness
came forward to verify the report made by the complainant
nor the complainant disclosed his presence at the time of
incident, while reporting the matter. It adds to our anxiety
that when the deceased then injured was conscious, alert,
and oriented in time & space, then he would have
mentioned the presence of the witness at the crime scene,
but he remained silent regarding his presence. The
participation of the eye witness in shifting the deceased
then injured to the hospital and receiving the dead body
after the postmortem was conducted and thereafter, his
presence on the spot at the time of spot pointation is another
factor which creates doubt regarding his presence. The
complainant while reporting the matter disclosed that on the
day of incident, he alongwith eye witness and accused were
{
busy in threshing and thereafter, the appellant left for his
house and after an interval, attracted to the spot; that he (the
deceased) took the Charpai (cot) from the courtyard to his
residential room and at the same time, the appellant entered
the room and asked regarding the cot and soon thereafter
started firing at him. This is surprising to note that during
spot inspection, the investigating cfficer neither took into

possession the thresher nor the same has been cited in the
-ll-

site plan. It is again surprising that the investigating officer
did not mention the presence of wife of the deceased in the
house at the time of occurrence. We are yet to know the
relationship between the accused / appellant and the
deceased and the motive which led to the death of the
deceased. When the very report is taken into consideration,
it fails to convince that why the appellant killed the
deceased, more particularly, when soon before the incident,
all the three were helping each other in threshing. When
this part of the case is taken into consideration in light of
the motive advanced then it further creates doubt regarding
the manner in which the incident occurred and regarding
the participation of the appellant in the incident. If the
appellant killed the deceased because of the reason that he
was an obstacle in their friendship, then it surprises us that
why the appellant was working with him and his son at the
time of incident, rather in that eventuality, he would have
not allowed the appellant to enter his house and to work
with them. Even the eye witness did not utter a single word
in that respect. The attending circumstances of the present
case lead us to hold that, the incident did not occur in the
mode & manner as alleged and presented. Even the
investigating officer was examined as PW-07, who failed to
explain that why the thresher was not taken into possession

and that why it finds no mention in the site plan. Even the
-12-

investigating officer could not explain that when the eye
witness was present in the hospital then how the site plan
was prepared on his pointation and, that how the recoveries
were signed from a witness who was not present on the spot
at the time when the recoveries were effected. The presence
of investigating officer on the spot at that time is
contradicted by the fact that by that time, the eye witness
was in the hospital as at that time, the postmortem
examination of the deceased was in progress. The record
further tells that both the wife of the deceased and his son
are the witnesses of identification as they identified the
dead body of the deceased before the police at the time
when the inquest report was prepared and before the doctor,
at the time of postmortem examination. The record further
tells that it was the eye witness who received the dead body
of the deceased after the postmortem examination. When
the presence of eye witness on the spot is not established
from the record then the recoveries effected and the site
plan prepared is a circumstance which goes against the facts
of the case. The prosecution story receives a major below
when the eye witness is not produced before the court and
as such, neither the eye witness was examined during trial
nor wife of the deceased and in:such eventuality, this court
is left with no option, but to hold that they were not ready to

depose against the appellant. As both the witnesses i.e. Mst.
-13-

Shazarina (wife of the deceased) and Zafar Ali (son of the
deceased) were not examined by the prosecution then no
inference can be drawn, but that they were reluctant to
support the false claim of the prosecution and there is no
cavil with the proposition that when the best available
evidence is not examined then’it is only and only the
prosecution to suffer. In the circumstances of the present
case, we lurk no doubt in mind that Article 129(g) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 can; be pressed into service.
In this regard, wisdom could also be derived from the

judgment rendered by the Apex Court in case titled “Lal

Khan Vs The State” (2006 SCMR 1846) wherein it was
held that:

“The prosecution is certainly not
required to produce a number of
witnesses as the quality and not the
quantity of the evidence is the rule but
non-production of most natural and
material witnesses of occurrence,
would strongly lead to an inference of
prosecutorial misconduct which would
not only be considered a source of
undue advantage for possession but
also an act of suppression of material
facts causing prejudice to the accused.
The act of withholding of most natural
and a_ material witness of the

occurrence would create an
-14-

impression that the witness if would
have been brought into witness-box,
he might not have supported the
prosecution and in uch eventuality
the prosecution must not be in a

position to avoid the consequence.”
10. The final question which needs determination from
this Court is the dying declaration of the deceased. There is
no cavil with the proposition that dying declaration is a
weak type of evidence and that it cannot be made the sole
basis for conviction. The concept of dying declaration is not
novel, rather it has its original in the medieval times where
it was felt necessary that in case of no evidence, other than
that of the dying man, the accused should not go scot free,
rather they must be brought to books even in case of
absence of other corroborative and circumstantial evidence,
provided the declaration made by the dying man rings true
and inspires confidence. At the very initial stages, the
courts of law acted upon the declaration made by a dying
person and even in absence .of corroborative and
circumstantial evidence, the responsibles were punished,
but gradually, with the passage of time, more particularly,
when the moral level of the individuals went recession then
the wise men realized that to punish on the basis of the sole

statement of a dying man would amount to injustice and so,

need was felt to search for independent corroboration. The
Ss

~15- ¢-

attitude of the courts of law remained different at different
intervals in respect of this piece of evidence and at times,
the courts of law went and declared it the most valuable
piece of evidence and corroboration was declared
immaterial, but at intervals, this attitude remained on the
other side and it was held to be a weak type of evidence
which needs corroboration. We have plethora of judgments
on either side from different jurisdictions and more
particularly, from the Apex Court of this land. With the
passage of time, with moral disintegration, need was felt to
protect both the sides, that is, the prosecution and defence.
As the courts of law are the custodians of the rights and
liberties of the people and that without having been
influenced from the status of the parties concerned, these
must protect and respect the law on the subject and the
jurisprudence on the subject. With each passing day, the
tendency of telling a lie and enroping innocent people is on
rise and if this tendency is left unchecked with a primitive
approach to this piece of evidence, then it would yield to
drastic consequences which has never been the intent and
purpose of law. In this era where the truth and false have
mixed to such an extent, an atmosphere of uncertainty has
been created, it is a must that corroboration must be
searched and seen from independent quarters, so that the

guilty would be punished and the innocent would be

;
. -16-

rescued. In this particular case, we have the statement of a
dying man who reported the matier while injured. This
court is to explore as to whether the deceased then injured
was capable to talk, when his report was penned down, as
to whether the scribe opted for taking a certificate from the
doctor concerned to know the capability of the dying man
to understand, to comprehend ard to talk. If this test
succeeds, then this court is to see as to whether the
attending circumstances of the present case support such
statement and as to whether independent witnesses were
examined in that respect. The record tells that the deceased
received firearm injury inside his house and that he was
rushed to the hospital where he was examined by the doctor
at 11:31 AM. The record further tells and so the medico
legal certificates that the injpred was produced to the doctor
by a police official, but nowhere the name of the eye
witness or wife of the deceased find mention. The doctor
was examined as PW-05, who stated that the injured was
brought before him at 11:31 AM by a constable namely
Bilal. He further disclosed that when the injured reached to
him, he was bleeding and he confirmed that the injured
arrived to the hospital at the stated time. Now this is
surprising that if the injured was brought to the hospital and
produced before the doctor at 11:31 AM, then how the

matter was reported at 11:15 AM. It further disturbs that
-17-

why the doctor did not mention the availability of private /
independent witnesses with injured at the time of
examination. The doctor declared that the injured remained
under his supervision from 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM and
soon thereafter, he was referred for specialized treatment to
civil hospital, Bannu. When the statement of this witness is
read in juxtaposition with the statement of Kalim Ullah
PW-04 i.e. the official to whom the matter was reported, it
tells another story. He was examined as PW-04, who stated
that he reached to the hospital soon after arrival of the
injured and prepared his injury sheet followed by Murasila,
but when the doctor confirmed that the injured arrived to
the hospital at 11:30 AM, then. how the matter could be
reported at 11:15 AM. The doctor further confirmed that
when he was examining the injured, he does not remember
as to whether by that time, the report had been made or not.
This portion of his statement further creates doubt in
respect of the time and the manner of examination. If we
accept that the injured arrived to the hospital at 11:30 AM
and from 11:30 AM to 12:01 PM, he remained under
supervision of the doctor and soon thereafter, he was
referred to Civil Hospital, Bannu, then it is for the
prosecution to tell that at what time, the matter was
reported. We have before us another intriguing aspect of the

case that the son of the deceased who posed himself to be
-18-

the eye witness of the incident did hot verify his report and
interestingly, if he had seen the occurrence and
accompanied the deceased then injured to the hospital then
it was a must for him to verify the report. This particular
aspect of the case goes deep to the roots of the prosecution
case. Now, it is for the prosecution to tell as to whether at
the time of report, the requisite formalities were complied
with and as to whether measures were taken to record the
report of the deceased then injured in line with the
directions issued by the superior courts from time to time.
The scribe was examined on this particular aspect of the
case who admitted that he did not opt for a certificate from
the doctor as at the time of report, the patient was capable
to talk. When as per statement of the scribe, the doctor was
busy in examining the injured and at the same time, he was
recording the statement of the deceased then injured, then
what precluded him to ask a certificate from the doctor, to
confirm that the deceased was fully conscious and capable
to talk. If the statement of PW-04 is taken to be correct,
then how could he say that the matter was reported to him
at 11:15 AM, when the doctor expressed his ignorance
regarding any report made in his presence. True that while
preparing the medico legal certificate, the doctor opined
that the injured was fully conscious and capable to talk, but

keeping the statement of PW-04' in consideration, it takes us
-19-;

to hold that both these witnesses were trying to conceal the
material aspects of the case. When the requisite formalities
are not complied with, when the certificate has not been
obtained from the doctor regarding the capability of the
deceased then injured, to talk and understand, then in that
eventuality, the statement so made needs independent
corroboration. This is unfortunate that the only
corroboration available with the prosecution was the so
called eye witness, but he was not produced before the trial
court and his statement was not recorded. Another
important factor of the case, which agitates the judicial
mind of this court is the manner in which the report was
made and the motive which led tie appellant to kill the
deceased. The very report on one hand is silent regarding
the presence of eye witness in the house at the time of
occurrence and on the other, when at the time of
occurrence, the relation between the deceased and accused /
appellant was cordial enough, then what agitated the
appellant to kill the deceased. As this particular aspect of
the case does not appeal to a prudent mind and when this
court feels itself unable to appreciate this particular aspect
of the case, in favour of the prosecution, then it reacts upon
the veracity of the report made :by the deceased then
injured. When on one hand, the requisite formalities for

recording the statement of the dying man have not been
-20-

fulfilled and when on the other, the attending circumstances
of the case did not convince the judicial mind of the court
regarding the manner in which the incident occurred, then
this court is not reluctant in holding that the prosecution
failed to bring home guilt against the appellant. In case
titled “Rafaat Shah Vs The State” (2022 PCr.LJ Note 39
Balochistan) it was held that:

“The mode and ‘manner of the

occurrence itself by the prosecution

is not appealable to the prudent

mined, therefore, it was highly

unsafe to rely on the statement of

both these witnesses to maintain

conviction and sentence of the

accused on a capital charge.”
11. The motive advanced by the complainant while
reporting the matter has not been proved and even the
investigating officer could not collect independent evidence
in that respect. As it is evident from the record that at the
time of incident all the three were busy in thrashing and
when no altercation took place between the two at the time
of thrashing and thereafter, then we are failed to understand
that what led the appellant to kill the deceased. Another
circumstance of the case cannot be ignored that it has never

been the case of the prosecution‘ that the deceased and
-21-

appellant little earlier to the incident altercated with each
other and that the appellant left the house and came back
duly armed to kill the deceased. The manner in which the
matter is reported and the manner in which the incident
occurred, both are not sufficient to convince this court
regarding the involvement of the appellant in the incident.
There is no cavil with the proposition that motive once
alleged must be proved and when 'the prosecution fails to
prove, then it reacts upon its case. As in the instant case, the
motive has not been proved, the presence of the appellant in
the house before the incident is not proved and when the
most important witness did not come to depose against the
appellant, then in such circumstances, this court is left with
no option, but to hold that the prosecution failed to establish
the alleged motive and under the circumstances, its benefit
must accrue to the appellant.

12. Though, from the place of incident, a .30 bore empty
was taken into possession, the same: was sent to the forensic
science laboratory which was received on 30.05.2019, after
a considerable delay, but the Lame is of no help to the
prosecution as no weapon of offence was recovered from
possession of the accused, at the time of his arrest, so to
establish that the same was fired from the weapon in
possession of the appellant. Even otherwise, the laboratory

report is a circumstantial evidence which can be pressed
-22-

into service only when the prosecution succeeds otherwise.
As in the instant case, the prosecution could not bring
substantial evidence on record, so this piece of evidence in
isolation cannot play a decisive role, rather it crawled to the
background and cannot be taken into consideration.

13. The cumulative effect of what has been stated above

t
t.

leads this court nowhere, but to hold that the learned trial
judge failed to comprehend the inherent worth of the
prosecution case and he failed to appreciate the available
evidence on file and as such, fell into error. As the
prosecution case is based on the only statement of a dying
man, that too, uncorroborated, sO we are not reluctant to
hold that without corroboration, this piece of evidence is
insufficient to connect the appellant with the murder of the
deceased, as such, the appellant has succeeded in making
out a case for indulgence of this court. The instant criminal
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside, and
the appellant is acquitted of the charges; he shall be
released forthwith if not required to be detained in
connection with any other criminal case.

14. As the prosecution has failed to prove the charges
against the appellant beyond reasonable doubts and since
the instant criminal appeal ended in acquittal, so the

Criminal Revision Petition .No.35-B of 2022 for
-23-
enhancement of sentence fails in the circumstances and is

dismissed as such.
