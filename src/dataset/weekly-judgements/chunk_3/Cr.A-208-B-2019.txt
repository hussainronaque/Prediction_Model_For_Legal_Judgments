SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- This appeal calls in
question the judgment dated 27.6.2019, authored by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Lakki Marwat,
whereby the accused/respondent Hanif Ullah, after
facing trial in case FIR No.93 dated 01.5.2011, under
sections 302/324/34 PPC, registered at police station
Pezu, District Lakki Marwat, was acquitted of the
‘charge.
2. The prosecution story, as divulged from

the FIR, is that on 01.5.2011, complainant Noor

- -2-

Muhammad Khan brought the dead body of his
grandson Rafiullah, with the help of co-villagers in a
private Datsun pickup to Adda Shahbaz Khel, and
reported the matter to Ajmal Khan ASI PP Shahbaz
Khel, to the effect that on the fateful day, he alongwith
his grandson Rafiullah Khan were on the way to their
house from Hujra/chowk on thoroughfare, that his
grandson Rafiullah was going ahead followed by the
complainant at some paces and at about 19:00 hours,
when reached to the Baithak of Najib Shah, there
accused Hanifullah, Suleman Shah, armed with
Kalashnikovs, while Najib Shah, empty handed were
already present at the door of their Baithak, that when
his grandson was about to cross the accused, accused
Najib Shah instigated his sons to kill him and in
response thereto, both the accused Hanifullah and
Suleman Shah immediately started firing at complainant
party with the intention to commit their gatl-i-amd, as a
‘tesult whereof complainant fortunately escaped unhurt
while his grandson Rafiullah got hit and fell to the

ground. The accused decamped from the spot after

-3-
commission of the offence. While shifting to PP
Shahbaz Khel, the injured succumbed to his injuries.
Motive for the offence was stated to be exchange of
firing between the parties few days prior to the
occurrence, though the matter was compromised but the
accused were still annoyed.

3. Initially, accused absconded, therefore, he
was proceeded against under Section 512, Cr.P.C.
Subsequently, the accused/respondent was arrested and
after facing trial, he was acquitted vide judgment
impugned herein, hence the instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record gone through.

5. It was on 01.5.2011, at 19:00 hours, when
the deceased was done to death, the incident was
Teported to the local police by the complainant charging
the respondent and two others for the crime. The
respondent was arrested, who faced the trial and
ultimately earned acquittal of the charges vide the
impugned judgment, feeling dissatisfied the same has

been questioned through the instant criminal appeal.

-4-
6. As we are seized of an appeal against
acquittal where undeniably the respondent has earned
double presumption of innocence to his credit, to
interfere and reverse the same, extraordinary
circumstances are needed as parameters for an appeal
acquittal and that of conviction are altogether different.
In situation in hand, the Court is to re-assess the already
assessed evidence to see as to whether the learned trial
Court correctly appreciated the evidence on file and as to
whether the impugned judgment is based on sound
reasoning. It is pertinent to mention that while hearing
an appeal, the jurisdiction conferred upon the appellate
court is not limited and restricted, rather it can travel
beyond the judgment questioned before and can form its
own independent opinion, after taking pains to read and
scan the record brought before, with the only and only
purpose to avoid miscarriage of justice. The appellate
Court is under the bounden duty to see that the
-order/judgment impugned is not arbitrary, mechanical
and perverse coupled with the fact that it does not suffer

from material irregularities and total illegalities, to

-5-
ascertain the same the collected material needs
reappraisal and that is what the Code empowers.

7. No doubt, the incident occurred in front of
the house of the accused/respondent and that the matter
was reported within an hour by the complainant, who
happens to be the grandfather of the deceased, but that
alone is not sufficient, rather the prosecution will travel
further and the complainant will toil hard to establish his
presence at the stated time with his projected purpose.
To begin with, it was on their way to their house when
the deceased was fired at alongwith the complainant.
The deceased received the fire shots whereas the
complainant was fortunate enough to escape unhurt. The
complainant is to show that what interest the accused
had in the deceased to kill, as the motive was not
directed to him. He is further to show that why he and
his sons were not targeted as they used the same path to
‘approach their home in routine. The prosecution is yet to
establish that what prompted a father and two real sons
.to join hands and eliminate the deceased, who by then

was only 18 years of age. The complainant was
-6-
examined as PW-6, who stated that he visited the local
hujra/chowk for gossip, it was on his return that the
accused fired at the deceased, who were present duly
armed in front of their house. We are yet to know that
when and where the deceased came across the
complainant, as the complainant did not mention his
presence in hujra. The record is silent regarding presence
of the deceased with the complainant prior to the
occurrence. The complainant stated his presence in the
hujra before the incident but the site plan is silent in that
respect and even the Investigating Officer did not
mention the same. The complainant failed to establish
his presence in hujra a little before the occurrence, he
did not produce anyone to confirm his presence. The
complainant was cross-examined on this particular
aspect of the case who replied that his presence in the
hujra was not in routine. The complainant did not utter a
single word regarding presence of the deceased in the
‘Village hujra before they left for their house. In the site
plan, the deceased has been shown at point No.1,

whereas the complainant at point No.2 with no occasion

-7-
to talk, but the complainant stated that prior to the
occurrence it was the deceased who disclosed the time as
7 PM. The complainant stated that he did not know how
to read a watch, but to cure the defect he introduced the
deceased who disclosed the time. If we admit what the
complainant stated regarding the stated time, then it was
for the complainant to show that they were together in
the hujra and so on their way to home, but he could not
and the entire record is silent in that respect.

8. The place of incident is shown situated in
front of the house of accused/respondent where the
respondent is shown at point No.4 with his co-accused at
point No.3 and their father Najeeb Shah at point No.5.
The complainant while reporting the matter disclosed
that the accused were already present duly armed, we are
yet to know that when the purpose was to kill, why they
did not fire at them on their first visibility and that why
they waited till they reached. We struggled hard to
explore that why a father joined hands with his sons to
-kill the deceased and that why the respondent would

wait till commanded, as by then he was 35 years of age

-8-
and such was the co-accused. The involvement of the
father is a circumstance that the prosecution failed to
explain, no evidence was led to connect Najeeb Shah
with the purpose, this failure on part of the prosecution
offers a premium to the accused/respondent. The
deceased received two fire shots on his back i.e. lumber
region with its exit on his front. In the site plan, the
deceased is shown at point No.1 with his right exposed
to the assailants, the seat of injuries run counter to the
claim of the complainant. The situation in the site plan
suggests that had the accused present at point No.3 and
fired at the deceased, the bullet would have landed on
his chest as the deceased was still to approach the
accused Hanif Ullah. Another circumstance which
troubles hard is the recovery of empties from point ‘A’
in the site plan. If we take it correct that accused fired
while standing at point No.3 and 4, then the empties
must have been recovered from the street as the
Kalashnikov ejects its empties to right front, whereas the
empties shown recovered, were lying at the back of the

accused, possibility cannot be excluded that the

-9-
deceased was fired from his back and the locale of
injuries further tells that it was the doing of a single
person. We cannot ignore that towards south is situated
the house of one Mir Ahamd, but only one bullet mark
was found despite the fact that 6 empties were recovered
from the spot. The complainant stated that he was fired
at but he luckily escaped unhurt. Had the complainant
been present, he would have been the prime target. If for
a while we admit that the complainant was fired at, then
in that eventuality the Investigating Officer must have
observed bullet marks on the wall, but its absence tells
negative of his presence at the time of incident.

9. The matter was reported at Bus Adda
Shahbaz Khel to one Ajmal Khan ASI, who was
examined as PW-4, who stated that while on gasht he
received information regarding the occurrence and
arrival of the dead body and that the incident was
reported at Bus Adda Shahbaz Khel. We are curious to
-know that who reported the matter and where? To reach
a correct conclusion, two circumstances are needed to be

answered i.e. (1) The time between injury and death; and

-10-
(2) that why the dead body was initially shifted to RHC
Titer Khel and then to Civil Hospital Lakki. As the
complainant stated that while en route to police post the
deceased breathed his last, when the deceased did not
die on the spot, in that eventuality, the opinion of the
doctor regarding the time between injury and death
would prevail. At the same time, the statement of PW-11
Atlas Khan gains importance when he stated that first he
escorted the dead body to RHC Titer Khel and then to
Civil Hospital Lakki. We cannot presume the other way
but that the deceased then injured was rushed to RHC
Titer Khel in injured condition by the co-villagers and it
was after his death that the complainant arrived and the
matter was reported. The medical evidence suggests that
the deceased was alive by 8:00 PM and then instead
section 302/34 PPC, Section 324/34 PPC should have
been inserted. A conscious effort was made to establish
promptness in report but both the scribe and complainant
‘ignored that the medical examination will tell otherwise.

The delayed postmortem examination further

-ll-
highlighted the conduct of the scribe and the
complainant.

10. Another factor that strongly goes against
the complainant and his family, is their constant
involvement in criminal cases, with several admitted
enmities. The record of numerous cases has been placed
on file, with copies of FIRs duly exhibited, the family
had several murder cases to their share. Their active
involvement in criminal activities is a circumstance
which goes against the complainant and helps us in
forming an opinion that the respondent and others had
no hand in the affair as admittedly, the matter of firing
stood patched up, though denied by the respondent.

11. The Investigating Officer visited the spot.
and recovered 6 empties of 7.62 bore with blood stained
earth from the place of deceased. The Investigating
Officer was examined as PW-6, who stated that he
visited the spot on the night of incident but could not
inspect the spot as the complainant was not present. He
“further stated that to preserve the spot, he deputed two

police constables. If he speaks the truth, then why he did

-12-

not mention the names of the deputed constables and
that why their statements were not recorded. Another
circumstance that goes against the prosecution is, that
the empties were not collected on his first visit to the
spot. The Investigating Officer admitted that he did not
make efforts to record statements of the independent
witnesses to confirm presence of the complainant in the
village hujra prior to the occurrence.

12. Another intriguing aspect of the case is that
‘the medical evidence does not support the case of
prosecution. It is the case of the complainant that when
the deceased reached in front of the house of the
accused, firing was made upon him which resulted into
injuries on his person. The postmortem report tells that
the deceased received two firearm entry wounds on his
back left right lumber region with its exit on the front,
whereas the accused/respondent was shown standing at
point No.4 and the co-accused Hanif Ullah, at point
No.3. If the respondent fired from point No.4, then in
that eventuality the deceased would have received

firearm injury on his right with its exit on the left, and

-13-
similarly, if the co-accused Hanif Ullah would fire upon
the deceased, the deceased would have received firearm
injury on his chest with its exit on his back, as by the
time when allegedly the firing was made, the deceased
had not yet reached the accused standing at point No.3.
The prosecution is still to explain that when both the
accused who effectively fired upon the deceased were
standing at a distance of 5 to 6 feet from the deceased,
then how one of the entry bore charring marks and the
second did not. The medical evidence does not support
the case of the prosecution. True that medical evidence
is confirmatory in nature and it cannot exclude the
ocular account provided the same inspire confidence. As
dissected earlier, the testimony of the complainant is not
worthy of credence then in that eventuality the medical
evidence has its own importance and when it comes in
conflict with the ocular account of the nature, it is the
medical evidence that would prevail, that is what is held

by the apex Court in its case reported as “Akhter Saleem

and another Vs the State and another” (2019 MLD

1107), it is held that:

-14-

“12. The above factors, material
contradictions between ocular and
medical evidence create serious
doubts in the happening of alleged
occurrence and it is well settled law
that even a single doubt, if found
reasonable, would entitle the accused
person to acquittal and not a
combination of several doubts.”

13. Much was stressed that the collected
empties were sent to the Firearm Expert and the result
received was in positive i.e. the collected six empties
were shown to have been fired from different weapons
and that in such eventuality, it has left no ambiguity to
hold that it was the act of more than one person. We are
to assess as to whether the prosecution proved the safe
custody of the collected empties and as to whether these
were recovered from the place of incident soon after the
occurrence. We cannot ignore that the Investigating
Officer was examined as PW-10 who stated that on the
night of occurrence, he reached the place of incident but
could not effect recoveries as the complainant was not
available in his house. We are surprised to see that what
precluded the Investigating Officer to search for the

blood and empties on the spot on his first visit to the

place of incident. The Investigating Officer did not

-15-

record the statement of the deputed police officials in
respect of the empties and blood. Even the Investigating
Officer did not mention that the empties and blood were
preserved on the spot by deputing police officials. The
collected empties were received to the Forensic Science
Laboratory on 09.5.2011, after a considerable delay, but
the Investigating Officer did not mention that where
these empties were lying in the intervening period, so
much so, neither the Moharrir of the concerned police
station was examined nor the police official who took
the same to the laboratory. The Investigating Officer
could not prove that the empties were lying in safe
custody and in such eventuality, we are not hesitant to
hold that the prosecution could not establish the safe
custody of the collected empties and its onward dispatch
to the Forensic Science Laboratory, as such, this piece of
evidence cannot be taken into consideration, that too, for
awarding capital punishment. The apex Court has dealt
with the situation in case titled Hayat Ullah Vs. The
State (2018 SCMR 2092), wherein it was held that:-

Much reliance was placed on the
recovery of pistol from the appellant

-16-

and empty from the place of
occurrence, we observe that the empty
was recovered on I 1.02.2006 and pistol
was recovered on 22.02.2006 and till the
recovery of the pistol the empty was not
sent to the firearm expert and the empty
and the pistol both remained together in
the Malkhana” and _ thereafter
transmitted to the office of the Forensic
Science Laboratory. So the recovery is
inconsequential. Even otherwise
recovery alone is not sufficient for
conviction and it is always termed as a
corroborative piece of evidence’ It is
settled law that one tainted piece of
evidence ‘can't corroborate another
- tainted piece of evidence.

14, The motive was stated to be an early
exchange of firing between the parties which was
allegedly compromised, but the Investigating Officer did
not collect anything to explain that who out of the sides
‘was involved in the said episode and that what role the
deceased played therein, as the deceased was hardly 18
years of age. Even the complainant did not produce
independent witnesses in that respect, more particularly,
the people who patched up the matter between them.
Tne that absence or weakness of motive does not play a
decisive role in believing or disbelieving the prosecution
‘case, but equally true that once the motive is alleged, the
prosecution is under the bounden duty to prove the same

failing which none else but the prosecution will suffer,

-17-
as is held in case titled "Hakim Ali Vs. The State"
( 1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution though not
called upon to establish motive in every case, yet once it
has setup a motive and failed to establish, the
prosecution must suffer consequences and not the
defence. The above view has been reiterated in the case
of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State" (PLD 1976 SC 629
wherein, it has been observed by their lordships, that
motive is an important constituent and if found by the
Court to be untrue, the Court should be on guard to
accept the prosecution story.

15. It was argued that the accused remained
absconder for sufficient long time and that he did not
surrender voluntarily, rather he was arrested in case
F.ILR No.306, under Sections 365-B/376 P.P.C in
District D.I.Khan and that it was from the judicial
lockup that he was collected and formally arrested. True
‘that the respondent was arrested and transported to the
concerned District but equally true that abscondence

-alone is not sufficient for awarding conviction, rather it

is a circumstance that can be taken into consideration

-18-
provided the prosecution succeeds in building its case
against the accused, whereas in case in hand, the
prosecution failed to establish its case beyond doubt.

16. The evidence is read with care and caution
and so the impugned judgment, but there is hardly any
occasion to interfere as the judgment impugned herein
does not suffer from any illegality, irregularity and
cannot be termed as arbitrary and perverse. Resultantly,

the instant criminal appeal is bereft of merit stands

dismissed.
