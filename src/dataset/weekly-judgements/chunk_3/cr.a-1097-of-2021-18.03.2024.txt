Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. has

2. According to First Information Report (“FIR”)
Exh.PA on 06.07.2017 at 1935 hours, complainant
Atif-ur-Rehman, reported to Mir Akbar SI (PW.5) in
injured condition in casualty of DHQ hospital Nowshera
Kalan to the effect that his Nikah was performed with
Mst. Sana Iqbal (daughter of appellant) and 16" August
2017 was fixed as the date of Rukhsati; that on
06.07.2017 he along with other family members visited
the house of his father-in-law (appellant), situated in
village Zarin Abad Nowshera Kalan where an altercation
took place between him and the appellant; that
the appellant took out his pistol and gave blows to him
and his brother due to which they sustained injures; that
the appellant then opened fire at them, as a result, he
(complainant) got hit and sustained injury on his neck.
Motive behind the occurrence was a dispute over Rishta.
Report of complainant was recorded in the shape of
Murasila Exh.PA/1 by Mir Akbar SI (PW.5), who also
prepared his injury sheet Exh.PW.5/1 and referred him
for medical examination.

3. Dr. Ikram (PW.10) examined the injured
complainant and found entry wound on left angle of
mandible and exit left lateral surface of left orbit. Patient
was referred to the Neuro Surgery Ward LRH for further

management.
4. Jehanzeb Khan SI (PW.9) conducted investigation
in the case, who after registration of the FIR proceeded to
the spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on the pointation
of eyewitness Fazal ur Rehman. During spot inspection
he took into possession one empty shell of 30 bore
Exh.P.1 vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/2. Vide recovery
memo Exh.PW.3/1 he took into possession blood stained
earth from the place of injured complainant Exh.P.2.
Vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/3 he took into possession
bloodstained garments of the injured, initiated
proceedings under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against
the appellant, recorded statements of the PWs under
section 161 Cr.P.C. and sent the bloodstained articles to
the FSL report whereof is Exh.PK. The appellant was
arrested by Kashif Khan SI (PW.2), who obtained his
physical remanded, interrogated him and recorded his
statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. and after completion
of investigation handed over case file to the SHO, who
submitted challan against the appellant before the learned
trial court.

5.  Onreceipt of challan by the learned trial court, the
appellant was summoned and formally charge sheeted to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove
its case, the prosecution examined as many as ten
witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s evidence,

statement of the appellant was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution’s
allegation and professed his innocence. He, however,
neither wished to be examined on oath nor opted to
produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial court, after hearing both the sides, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned in the initial
paragraph of the judgment, hence, this appeal.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard.
Record and evidence perused with their able assistance.

7. In this case the occurrence has taken place on
06.07.2017 at 1855 hours, in front of house of appellant
Iqbal-ud-Din situated in village Zarin Abad Nowshera
Kalan which has been reported with promptitude at 1935
hours by injured complainant Atif-ur-Rehman (PW.6) in
DHQ hospital Nowshera Kalan. Ocular account of the
occurrence has been furnished by injured complainant
and his brother Fazal-ur-Rehman (PW.7). The former
while appearing in the witness box reiterated the same
story as set forth by him in his initial report Exh.PA/1.
He once again directly and singularly charged the
appellant for commission of the offence. As stated
earlier, the occurrence has been report with promptitude
eliminating the possibility of consultation and
deliberation on the part of complainant in making report.
Similarly, being a broad day light occurrence and

appellant being father-in-law of the complainant,
question of mistaken identity also does not arise.
Complainant having stamp of injury on his person his
presence at the spot cannot be doubt. Recovery of blood
from the place of the injured vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.3/1, his bloodstained garments taken into
possession vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/3 and positive
Serologist report Exh.PK in respect thereof corroborate
the ocular account of the prosecution’s case. Similarly,
medical evidence furnished by Dr. Ikram (PW.10), also
supports version of the injured complainant.

8. The testimony of Fazal ur Rehman (PW.7), who is
also an eyewitness of the occurrence corroborates the
ocular account furnished by injured complainant.
PW Fazal ur Rehman is brother of the injured
complainant and his visit to the house of appellant along
with complainant so as to finalize the arrangement for
marriage of the complainant with the daughter of the
appellant seems quite natural. He deposed that when they
reached the place of occurrence an altercation (exchange
of hot words) took place between the appellant and the
complainant during which course the appellant opened
fire at them, as a result, complainant got hit and sustained
injury; that the injured was shifted to DHQ hospital
Nowshera Kalan where he reported about the occurrence

in injured condition and he verified the same.
+”

9. Both the above named eyewitnesses have been
subjected to lengthy and taxing cross-examination by the
defence but nothing beneficial could be extracted from
their mouths. They remained stuck to their stance and
corroborated each other on all material particulars of the
occurrence such as the day, date, time and place of
occurrence as well as mode and manner of the
occurrence. Nothing of the sort has been brought from
their mouths so as to suggest false implication of the
appellant for some ulterior motive.

10. On reappraisal of the prosecution’s evidence I
have arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution has
proved guilt of the appellant under section 324 PPC,
however, keeping in view the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case revealing from the available
evidence, sentence of the appellant under section 324
PPC requires a bit consideration. Admittedly, there was
no previous ill will between the parties rather appellant
was father-in-law of the injured complainant and on the
fateful day the complainant party visited the house of the
appellant to finalize marriage ceremony of his daughter
with the complainant. Reason, on the basis of which
exchange of hot words took place between the
complainant and the appellant, has not been disclosed by
any of the eyewitness. Similarly, report of the

complainant Exh.PA/ is also silent in this regard,
meaning thereby that the occurrence took place at the
spur of moment and the appellant in the heat of passion
opened fire at the complainant party, as a result, he
sustained injury on his neck. The complainant has not
attributed the role of repetition of firing to the appellant.
Similarly, except injury on his neck, he has not stated
about any injury sustained by him on his chest or any
other part of his body. In this view of the matter,
conviction of the appellant under section 324 PPC is
maintained, however, his sentence is reduced from five
years rigorous imprisonment to three years rigorous
imprisonment. His sentence of fine under section 324
PPC is also maintained.

11. As per medico legal report, hurt is also caused to
injured complainant on his neck by the act of firing of the
appellant, in addition of attempt to commit quatl-e-Amd,
the appellant shall also be liable to the punishment
provided for the hurt caused to him. As per findings of
the learned trial court, hurt caused to the complainant
falls within the definition of “Jaifak”, punishable under
section 337-D PPC., however, findings of the learned
trial court are not supported by prosecution’s evidence. In
his initial report Exh.PA/1 the injured complainant has
categorically stated that he received single firearm injury
on his neck due to firing of the appellant. He reiterated

the same fact in his court statement recorded as PW.6.
Similarly, as per medico legal report Exh.PW.10/1
furnished by Medical Officer who examined the injured
at first instance only one entry wound on the left angle of
mandible with exit on left lateral surface of orbit was
found on the person of the injured complainant. No
doubt, later on, on 19.08.2017 as per maxillofacial ward
report there was left ZMC (Zygomatic) fracture with the
bullet shot and loss of sensation on the left Zygomatic
region and a single bullet in the chest was also shown
removed by thoracic surgeon in LRH. In view of the
report ibid, the nature of injury of the complainant was
declared to be Jaiffa punishable under section 337-D
PPC. This court is not in agreement with the findings of
the learned trial court because the injured neither in his
report nor in his court statement has uttered a single word
about any injury sustained by him on his chest. He has
categorically stated that he received single fire shot on
his neck. No evidence such as treatment record of the
complainant so as to prove his injury within the meaning
of section 337-D PPC has been brought on record.
Evidence available on record prove only single firearm
entry wound on left angle of mandible having exit left
lateral surface of left orbit, which falls within the
definition of Shajjah-i-Hashimah, has been proved.
Under section 337-A(iii) PPC, if any person causes

Shajjah —i-Hashimah to any person shall be liable to
Arsh which shall be ten percent of the diyat and may also
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a
term which may extend to ten years as Ta’azir. Although,
no charge has been framed against the appellant under
section 337-A (iii) PPC, however, under section
423 Cr.P.C. the appellate court has ample power to alter
findings of the learned trial court, maintain the sentence
or with or without altering the findings reduce the
sentence or with or without such reduction and with or
without altering the finding alter the nature of the
sentence. For the sake of convenience and ready
reference section 423 Cr.P.C. is reproduced below:-

“§.423, Powers of Appellate Court in disposing
of appeal:- (1) The appellant Court shall then send

for the record of the case, if such record is not
already in court. After perusing such record, and
hearing the appellant or his pleader, if he appears,
and the Public Prosecutor, if he appears, and, in
case of an appeal under section 411-A sub-section
(2) or section 417, the accused, if he appears, the
court may if it considers that there is no sufficient
ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may

(a)in an appeal from an order of

acquittal, reverse such order and direct

that further inquiry be made, or that the

accused be retired or sent for trial to the

court of Sessions or the High Court, as

the case may be or find him guilty and

pass sentence on him according to law;

(b) in n__appeal__from__a

conviction (1) reverse the finding and

sentence and acquit or discharge the

accused, or order him to be retried by
10

a_court of competent jurisdiction
subordinate to such Appellate Court
or_sent for trial, or (2) alter _the
finding, maintaining the sentence, or,
with or without altering the findin

reduce the sentence, or, (3) with or
without such reduction _and_with or
without altering the finding, alter the
nature of the sentence but, subject to
the provisions of section 106 _sub-
section_(3) not_so_as to enhance the
same.
(c)In an appeal from any other order,
alter or reverse such order;
(d) Make any amendment or any
consequential or incidental order that
may be just or proper.

12. As stated earlier appellant has not been charge

sheeted under section 337-A (iii) PPC, however, under
provisions of section 238(2) Cr.P.C., when an accused is
charged with an offence and facts are proved which
reduce it to a minor offence, he may be convicted of the
minor offence, although he is not charged with it. For the
sake of convenience and guidance section 238 Cr.P.C. is
reproduced below:-

“§.238. When offence proved included in

offence charged:- (1) When a person is

charged with an offence consisting of several

particulars, a combination of some only of

which constitutes a complete minor offence,

and such combination is proved, but the

remaining particulars are not proved, he may
is]

be convicted of the minor offence, though he
was not charged with it.

(2) When a person is charged with an
offence and facts are proved which reduce it
to a minor offence, he may be convicted of
the minor offence, although he is not
charged with it.

(2A) When a person is charged with an
offence, he may be convicted of an attempt to
commit such offence although the attempt is
not separately charged.

13. Window has been provided under section
423 Cr.P.C. and section 238 Cr.P.C. for the appellate
court to meet with the situation like the one in the present
case. Framing of charge would not per se mean that
accused was guilty, but its object was to inform him
about the case upon which he had to be prosecuted.
Charge would just enable court to start with the trial and
after recording evidence decide whether such charge had
been established against the accused or not. When charge
was for a major offence, but a minor offence was proved,
accused could be convicted of minor offence within the
meaning of section 238 Cr.P.C.

14. In view of the provisions of section 238 and 423
CrP.C., this court instead of remanding the case to the
learned trial court, has ample power to rectify the error

committed by the learned trial court in the sentence of the
12

appellant. Accordingly, by invoking the provisions of
section 423 and 238 Cr.P.C., this court alter the
conviction of appellant from section 337-D PPC to
section 337-A (iii) PPC and sentenced the appellant to
pay Arsh equal to ten percent of diyat to injured
complainant. No doubt, section 337-A(iii) PPC besides
the sentence of Arsh also provides that the offender may
also be punished with imprisonment of either description
for a term which may extent to ten years as Ta‘azir,
however, such punishment is subject to proof of the
essential ingredients enumerated in section 337-N (2)

PPC. In case titled, “Abdul Wahab and others Vs the

State and others” (2019 SCMR 516), Hon’ble Supreme

Court while examining the provisions of section
337-N(2) PPC has held that:-

“We have noticed that according to the
provisions of section 337-N(2) PPC, a
punishment of imprisonment by way of
Ta’azir can be passed against a convict

only if the convict is “previous convict

habitual _or hardened, desperate_or
dangerous criminal or the offence has
been committed by him in the name or

on the pretext of honour”, It had been
held in the cases of Ali Muhammad Vs

the State (PLD 2009 Lahore 312),
Mazhar Hussain Vs the State and another

(2012 SCMR 887) and Haji Maa Din and
C»

13

another vs the State and another (1998

SCMR 1528) that in a case pertaining to

causing of hurt unless the provisions of

section 337-N(2) PP are attracted to the

case of the convict he cannot be awarded

a sentence of imprisonment by way of

Ta’ azir.
An iota of evidence is not available on file to prove the
essential ingredients of section 337-N (2) PPC against the
appellant, therefore, punishment as ¢a’zir is not awarded
to the appellant under section 337-A (iii) PPC.
15. With the above modification in the conviction and
sentences of the appellant, this appeal stands disposed of
accordingly.
