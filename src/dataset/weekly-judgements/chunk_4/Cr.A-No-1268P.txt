SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, _J:- Appellant
Muhammad Abid, through Cr.A.No.1268-P/2022
has impugned the judgment dated 25.11.2019 of
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI/Judge
Child Protection Court, Mardan delivered in
case FIR No.426- dated 15.08.2018 under
sections 302/109/34 PPC of Police Station
Choora, Mardan, whereby he has been
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to imprisonment for life on two counts
and to pay sennaeeeien amounting to
Rs.200,000/- to the legal heirs of the deceased
under section 544-A Cr.P.C recoverable as
arrears of land revenue or in default whereof to
undergo simple imprisonment for six months with

benefit under section 382-B Cr.P.C, whereas
through the same judgment in the same case,
respondent-accused Mushtaq and Farman Ali
have been acquitted of the charge by the learned
trial court. Complainant Bakht Wali, through
Cr.A.No.36-P/2023 has assailed acquittal of
accused Mushtaq and Farman Ali, whereas
through  Cr.R.No.10-P/2023. he — sought
enhancement of the sentence awarded to
convict/appellant Muhammad Abid. Since the
three matters are the off-shoot of one and the
same judgment, therefore, these are proposed to
be disposed of by this single judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
15.08.2018, complainant Bakht Wali (P.W.5)
brought the dead body of his sister Mst.Janha to
police post Dubai Adda in private Datsun and
reported the matter to the effect, that on the
eventful day he was present in his house and
about 1400 hours asian Ali s/o Farman Ali came
to his house and iil him that his sister
Mst.Janha had died due to illness. He, thereafter
rushed to the place of occurrence and found his
sister lying dead in her house. He, on the basis
of his personal satisfaction, came to know that

his sister was killed by the accused/appellant by
strangulation at the instigation of Mushtaq and
Farman Ali canes Consequently, on the
report of complainant, present case was
registered against the accused/appellant. Motive
behind the occurrence was stated to be strained
relations between the husband and wife as well
as the appellant and her father-in-law.

ot On arrest of the appellant and
completion of investigation, challan was
submitted before the court of competent
jurisdiction, charge .was framed to which he did
not plead guilty and wished for trial. As such the
learned trial court’ was pleased to direct the
prosecution to produce its evidence. In order to
prove its case, prosecution produced and
examined as many as 10 witnesses, whereafter
statement of the accused was recorded, where
the accused professed his innocence but did not
opt to record his chitaiaed under section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial
court held him guilty and as such he was
convicted and cantettacil whereagainst he has
filed the instant appeal.

4. Heard. Record perused.
5s It was - « 15.08.2018, when the
deceased died in ines of her husband and
the dead body of the deceased was shifted to the
police post Dubai Adda, for reporting the matter.
The complainant rainontad the matter to one Rab
Nawaz, SI who prepared the injury sheet and
inquest report, thereafter the dead body was sent
to the hospital for — mortem examination. The
complainant while reporting the matter charged
the appellant, the husband of the deceased
namely, Mushtaq and her father-in-law for the
murder of the deceased. The dead body was
examined by the doctor where the cause of
death and the nature of injuries on her body were
explained. The investigating officer, after
receiving copy of the FIR, visited the spot and on
pointation of the complainant prepared the site
plan. The accused .was arrested, his physical
custody was requested, which was granted and it
was during investigation that the accused/
appellant led the sollte party to the spot and on
his pointation addition in the site plan was made.
The other co-accused were also arrested as they
were charged for ign abetment of the offence. It

is pertinent to mention that the convict/appellant
was produced before the court of learned
Judicial Magistrate on 18.08.2018 where he
confessed his guilt. The trial commenced and the
learned trial court provided opportunity to the
complainant to produce the relevant witnesses.
On conclusion of the trail, the learned trial court
was pleased to convict the appellant and to
acquit the co-accused, charged for abetment,
vide the impugned senicants

6. The learned trial court, after hearing the
parties, applied its judicial mind to the collected
evidence and the statements of the witnesses
and thereafter convicted the appellant for the
murder of the deceased and acquitted the co-
accused. This court is to see as to whether the
learned trial Peerer te justified to convict the
appellant and to acquit the acquitted co-accused
and as to whether. while passing the impugned
judgment the vas trial court applied its
judicial mind to the ,evidence on file and to the
statements of the witnesses. As this court is
seized of the matter, so it is obligatory that we
must go through the statements of the witnesses
and the material available on file so that to

appreciate as to whether the prosecution
co

succeeded in bringing home guilt against the
appellant. True that in the incident Mst.Janha lost
her life in the house of her husband and equally
true that apart from her husband the appellant
and her father-in-law were also charged for the
commission of the abies True that when a lady
dies an unnatural. death in the house of her
husband, then some of the responsibility is
shifted to the shoulders of her husband and that
the husband must convince the courts of law for
the circumstances in which the deceased dies an
unnatural death. As in this particular case, it is
not the husband who is charged for killing of the
deceased, rather it is the brother-in-law of the
deceased who is charged and the husband along
with another for abetment. As nobody saw the
incident and that the complainant came forward
to report the matter, when he_ received
information regarding the death of the deceased.
In this particular case, this court is conscious of
the fact that when. the active role of killing has
been given to the appellant and not to her
husband, so in such eventuality, the prosecution
is to shoulder the major portion of the

responsibility and the accused/convict is
shouldering the lesser portion. In order to avoid
miscarriage of justice, we feel it essential to
revisit the evidence on file and to re-appreciate
the statements of the witnesses.

7. The moot questions to be determined by
this Court are; as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated
time; as to whether it was the accused/appellant
who killed the deceased and that these were the
co-accused who facilitated; as to whether the
accused/appellant was arrested in the mode and
manner and as to whether he confessed his guilt
before the court of competent jurisdiction. This
court is further to determine as to whether the
medical evidence Supports the case of the
prosecution qua the death of the deceased.

8. There is no denial to the fact that the
unfortunate deceased lost her life in the house of
her husband and that the matter was reported by
the complainant who‘ happens to be the brother
of the deceased. True that soon after the death
neither the husband, nor the father-in-law of the
deceased took the dead body of the deceased
either to the hospital or to the concerned police

station for registration of the case, but the same
is not the determining factor, rather the
prosecution is under ee obligation to prove that
it was the appellant aie killed the deceased and
that these were the co-accused who facilitated.
In order to unearth the real cause of death, we
deem it essential to go through the statements of
the witnesses. The complainant was examined
as P.W.5 who stated that on the day and time of
occurrence, he was present in his house; that he
was informed by Aman Ali at about 03:00 PM
who told him that his sister had died because of
ailment; he rushed to the house of his sister and
found her dead; that on searching her body, he
found bruises and injuries and got satisfied that
she was murdered by the convict/appellant who
was abetted by his co-accused namely, Mushtaq
(husband of the deceased) and Farman Ali
(father-in-law of the deceased); that motive for
the offence was strained relation between the
accused facing trial and the deceased; that he
reported the matter and that it was on his
pointation that the investigating officer prepared
the site plan. When the statement of the
complainant is taken into consideration, this

court reaches nowhere, but to hold that the
complainant was not the eyewitness of the
incident. As at the time of occurrence the
complainant was available in his house and that
it was the co-accused Farman Ali who informed
him regarding the death of the deceased, so the
very information by the father-in-law of the
deceased is a circumstance, which tells of bona
fide on part of the co-accused and which tells
that the co-accused never abetted the convict/
appellant, in killing the deceased. As in the
instant case, no witness from the house came
forward and even the investigating officer did not
record the statement of an independent person
from the house, so the prosecution case is
hinging upon the circumstantial evidence. There
is no denial to the fact that when a case rests
upon the circumstantial evidence, then the
prosecution is under’ the obligation to collect
independent pieces of evidence and to weave
them in a net forming an organic whole. It is the
foremost duty of the prosecution, in case of the
circumstantial evidence, to create a chain where
all the links are link together and its one end
touches the body of the deceased and the other

must touch the neck of the accused. As in this
10

particular case, the investigating officer could not
collect independent evidence and even no
circumstantial evidence could be collected to
create a chain, so in the instant case, the only
evidence in possession of the prosecution is the
confessional statement of the appellant and the

medical evidence. Reliance can be placed on

“Naveed Asghar and 2 others Vs. The State”
(P L D 2021 S.C 600), which reads as follows:-

“Circumstantial evidence may
sometimes .be conclusive, but it
must always ‘be narrowly examined.
In cases like the present one that
rest entirely on _ circumstantial
evidence, it is of the utmost
importance that the circumstances
should be ascertained with minute
care and caution, before any
conclusion or inference adverse to
the accused person is drawn. The
process of inference and deduction
involved in such cases is of a
delicate and perplexing character,
liable to numerous causes of fallacy.
This danger points the need for great
caution in accepting proof of the
facts and circumstances, before they
are held to be established for the
purpose of drawing inferences
therefrom. A mere concurrence of
circumstances, some or all of which
are supported by defective or
inadequate evidence, can create a
specious appearance, leading to
fallacious inferences. Hence, it is
necessary __ that only such
circumstances should be accepted
as the basis of inferences that are,
on careful examination of the
evidence, found to  be_ well-
established. A high quality of
evidence is, therefore, required to
prove the facts and circumstances
from which the inference of the guilt
of the accused person is to be

drawn”
9. This is a must for this Court to know as
to whether the dea: of the deceased occurred in
the manner as was given by the complainant and
as to whether the medical evidence supports the
stance of the complainant. For this particular
purpose, we deem it essential to go through the
statement of the doctor who was examined as
P.W-9 who Stated:that on 15.08.2018, she
conducted autopsy on the dead body of
deceased Mst.Janha wife of Mushtaq brought by
constable Tariq identified by Sartaj s/o
Ahmadullah and Qasim Khan s/o Zarawar and
found the following on examination:-
“External Examination:

Marks of ligature on neck and
dissection etc. Bruises all around neck.
12

Condition of subject: stout fresh body.

Injuries:

1. Bruises on. neck, face with bluish
discoloration synopsis.

2. Bruises on upper chest, shoulders
and back.

3. A lacerated wound about 4 to 6 cm
on chin and right side of jaw.”

The statement of the doctor left no
ambiguity regarding the manner in which the
deceased was done to death. Whether the sole
medical report by itself would be sufficient to hold
the appellant iencondaite for the death of the
deceased or the prosecution must bring on
record more evidence in that respect. As the
complainant was an the eyewitness and as no
other witness came forward to testify in favour of
the prosecution and against accused, so we
deem it essential to read the confessional
statement of the appellant in juxtaposition with
the medical report of the deceased. The
appellant was arrested, his physical custody was
requested and during investigation he opted to
confess his guilt and as such he was produced
before the court of competent jurisdiction. The
learned counsel for the appellant questioned the

very nature of the confessional statement and

also the manner in which the same was
13

recorded. We went. through the formalities taken
into consideration by the concerned Magistrate
and we also went through the questionnaire
prepared for the purpose. Apparently, we did not
come across any . illegality to have been
committed, by the Magistrate, while recording the
confessional statement of the appellant but mere
procedural correctness would not guarantee that
the confessional statement was free from
influence and was voluntary. In order to
appreciate as to ition the appellant confessed
his guilt and as to whether he was provided the
needed opportunity to think, consider and to
make up his mind for recording the same. For
this purpose, the learned Judicial Magistrate was
examined as P.W-10, who stated that during the
days of occurrence he was posted as Judicial
Magistrate, Mardan.. On 18.08.2018, accused
facing trial Muhammad Abid was _ produced
before him in case FIR No.426 dated 15.08.2018
under sections 302/109/34 PPC registered with
police station Choora, Mardan by the
investigating officer vide application already
Ex.P.W.7/3 for recording his confessional

statement at 01:00 -hours; the handcuffs were
removed and all the police Officials including APP
and Naib Court were directed to leave the court,
so that the accused should not feel under
pressure; the accused was made to sit and he
introduced himself to the accused and after
getting satisfaction regarding the will of the
appellant, to confess, his confessional statement
was recorded. The Magistrate was examined on
different aspects of the case, more particularly,
the manner in which the accused/appellant was
produced and the manner his statement was
recorded. We cannot forget that during the days
of occurrence, the convict/appellant was 15/16
years of age and that in such eventuality it was
the obligation of the learned Judicial Magistrate
to have facilitated him to have a meeting with his
counsel and that the nearest relative must have
been provided an opportunity to visit him a little
before his confessional statement was recorded.
The record is silent in that respect and as such
this court is confident in holding that the requisite
formalities could not be fulfilled. As in case of
major accused the obligations of the Judicial
Magistrate are all together different than the

minor accused, as in case of minor accused
every step and every pre-caution must be taken
to satisfy itself that the minor was feeling at
home and that he was free from pressure and
influence, but in the instant case the learned
Magistrate adopted a casual approach as is
adopted in case of the major accused. In such
eventuality, this attitude of the court by itself is a
circumstance, which raises an eyebrow over the
legality and the voluntary character of the
confessional statement. In order to know as to
whether the convict/appellant accepted the guilt
and as to whether he narrated the events as it
occurred and that he disclosed the same. For
this particular purpose, we deem it essential to
reproduce the’ relevant portion of the
confessional statement of the appellant, which
reads as follows:-
“On the day of occurrence, | came
from the fields to my house. | was
about to have lunch in the courtyard
of my house. My sister-in-law
Mst.Janha approached me from the
back side and grab my testicles. | got
her by throat/neck and applied

pressure resultantly she died at the
spot.”

The confessional statement of the

appellant runs in conflict with the medical

evidence and the physical circumstances of the
16

case as well. As on one hand, the age of the
deceased was declared 25 years, by the doctor
with further observations that the deceased was
blessed with a stout side whereas on the other
the appellant was hardly 15/16 years of age.
When the strength of both i.e. the deceased and
the appellant is compared, this Court is not in a
happy mood to aecept that the appellant had
such a strength, which led to the death of the
deceased. The medical evidence negates the
confessional statement of the appellant, as the
deceased had bruises, laceration and even the
marks of ligature. The attending circumstances
of the present lead this court nowhere, but to
hold that apart from the appellant other able
bodied persons ‘also participated but the
prosecution failed to charge. As the confessional
statement is in conflict with the medical evidence
and the circumstantial evidence as well, so the
same cannot be taken into consideration. When
the story narrated by the appellant, while
confessing his guilt, does not appeal to a prudent
mind then the same can neither be considered
nor can be taken into consideration for the

conviction of an accused charge. Reliance in this
17

regard is placed on “SADI AHMAD and
another Vs. The State”, (2019 S C MR 1220),

which reads as follows:-

“Adverting to confessional
statement of Mukhtar Ahmad alias
Bari recorded on 14.1.2019, we do
not feel persuaded to rely upon the
disclosure; it is not in line with

prosecution case set up in the

crime report; so _ diametrically
different that one cannot be
accepted without exclusion of
other and vice versa; it is
exculpatory in nature as Mukhtar
Ahmad is_ reticent about his
individual role and liability in the
crime. According to him, the
deceased was blind folded, thrown
ina sugarcane field with his hands
tied with a rope, whereas as per
autopsy report cause of death is
asphyxia. Motive behind sudden
move by the appellant, Mukhtar
Ahmad alias Bari during the trial is
far from: clear; disclosure is
certainly not a truthful account of
event leading to deceased's death.
When’ confronted during his
examination under Section 342 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1898, he denied to have confessed
his guilt; he repudiated pangs of
conscience, mistakenly observed

by the _ learned trial Judge.
Prosecution has not been able to
drive home the charge beyond
reasonable doubt, therefore, in the
absence. of reliable evidence
appellants' conviction on moral
satisfaction alone cannot sustain;
they are extended the benefit of the
doubt. Criminal Appeal 107-L/2017
is allowed, impugned judgment is
set aside; they shall be released
forthwith, -if not required in any
other case.”

10. We cannot forget that the incident
occurred in the courtyard of the house at 02:00
PM and admittedly, in the said house apart from
the appellant the husband of the deceased
namely, Mushtaq, the co-accused and father-in-
law of the deceased were also residing. Had the
incident occurred in the manner and at the stated
place, then the inmates of the house would have
come to rescue of the deceased, but the silence
in that respect is a circumstance, which tells that
the incident did not occur in the manner. As the
deceased was having injuries on her body and
that the same were not possible in such a short
interval, rather the material facts were either
concealed or weré not brought on record. If we
accept for a while that the story narrated by the

convict/appellant was correct then we are to say
goodbye to rest of the evidence on file and in
that eventuality, we would discard the medical
evidence on file. If such exercise is undertaken,
then we are afraid that the prosecution would be
left with the sole confessional statement of the
appellant and the same alone would not be
sufficient to ask for conviction. If we take it
otherwise and discard the confessional
statement of the appellant and take _ into
consideration the medical evidence and the
circumstantial evidence, then in that eventuality,
the prosecution is left with the evidence, which is
not corroborative and, thereto, the prosecution
would suffer. Both the pieces of evidence i.e. the
confessional statement of the appellant and the
medical evidence are in conflict and despite
efforts no harmony can be created between
them, when such is the state of affairs, this Court
is confident in holding that the confessional
statement is not in'accordance with law and that
no opportunity was provided to the appellant to
recompose and consult the people of his choice,
so in such eventuality this Court is confident in
holding that this piece of evidence is not worth

reliance. When the very statement is in conflict
20

with the physical citcumstances of the present
case, then in ieolatiol this piece of evidence
would hardly play ne role to determine the fate
of the appellant. In the attending circumstances
of the present case, this Court lurks no doubt in
mind that the prosecution could not succeed in
connecting the appellant and the acquitted co-
accused with the murder of the deceased.

11. As this was the choice exercised by the
complainant where he attributed the active role
of killing to the wen iaclivas and the role of
abetment to the husband of the deceased and to
her father-in-law, so this is the complainant to
run with his choice and this court is to determine
as to whether every’ individual character does fit
in the circumstances of the present case. We are
not hesitant in holding that the choice exercised
by the complainant has damaged _ the
prosecution case, had this been the husband to
whom the active role of killing was attributed,
then in that eventuality the appreciation of the
circumstances before this Court would be
different, but as the male members are charged
for abetment/facilitation, that too, with no

evidence on record, so this Court is of the
21

opinion that the prosecution failed to bring home
guilt against the appellant.

12. The motive was disclosed as the
strained relation between the husband and wife
as well as the appellant and her father-in-law, but
surprisingly no independent witness came
forward to support the stance of the complainant
and even nothing was collected by the
investigating officer in that respect. If the relation
was strained, then it would have been between
the husband and wife and the appellant would
play a little role, but if we accept that the incident
occurred as was disclosed by the appellant in his
confessional statement, then the husband and
father-in-law of the deceased had no interest,
rather the tragic incident then occurred at the
spur of the moment. The prosecution failed to
convince us regarding the alleged motive and as
such on this score too, the prosecution would
suffer. True that weakness or absence of motive
is hardly a ground to acquit, but equally true that
once the motive is. the cause to kill, then the
prosecution is under obligation to prove the

same and its failure will favour the accused.
22

13. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above leads this court nowhere, but to
hold that the prosecution failed to bring home
guilt against the deol The impugned
judgment is suffering from errors and legal
infirmities, which calls for interference. The
learned trial court while handing down the
impugned judgment misdirected itself both in law
and on facts of the case. The impugned
judgment is set aside and the appellant is
acquitted from the ‘charge levelled against him.
He be released ad jail forthwith if not required
to be detained in any other case.

14. Now diverting to Cr.A.No.36-P/2023,
which has been filed by the complainant against
acquittal of accused-respondents Mushtaq and
Farman Ali. The record tells that the accused-
respondents have not been directly charged by
the complainant in the FIR for commission of the
offence, rather they' were nominated in the case
as accused for abetting the offence and no
corroboratory material has been brought by the
prosecution showing their alleged role with the
case. Mere nomination of someone for abetment

of an offence would not be a ground to convict
23

him. Moreover, there is no cavil with the
proposition that an.accused is presumed to be
innocent unless oe guilty and once the court
of competent jurisdiction acquits an accused
from the charge, then double presumption of
innocence is credited to his account and extra
ordinary circumstances are needed to upset the
same and the instant case is no exception. As
the main accused is acquitted of the charge,
therefore, instant criminal appeal against
acquittal is lacking substance, failed to proceed
and is dismissed as such.

15. Now turning to Cr.R No.10-P/2023,
where the complainant has asked for the
enhancement of obaleaiia but as the appeal is
allowed and the appellant stood acquitted, so the
instant criminal revision has lost its utility, the

same is dismissed as such.
