SYED ARSHAD ALI, J:- Appellant/Complainant
Abdul Razzaq filed the present appeal under Section 417
Cr.P.C against the judgment and order dated 25.04.2009,
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Mansehra, whereby respondents No. | to 3 namely Waris
Khan, Rehan Shah and Gul Khan were acquitted in case
FIR No.544 dated 07.12.2006 under Sections 324/337-
A(i)/34 PPC, Police Station, Saddar District Mansehra.
2. The brief and essential facts leading to the
present appeal are that Abdul Razzag, the present
appellant/complainant on 07.12.2006 at 1700 hours, in
injured condition reported the matter to the police that on

the eventful day, he alongwith his brother Muhammad
Nawaz, Rohan Shah and Gul Khan were present in
Choora ground Bherkund and were playing cricket. In the
meantime, altercation took place between the
complainant and Rohan Shah. Accused Gul Khan caught
hold of the brother of complainant Muhammad Nawaz
and Rohan Shah gave him a stick blow, whereas accused
Wasif Khan who was armed with pistol came to the spot
and starting firing at the complainant, as result of which,
the complainant got injured, hence the ibid case FIR was
chalked out.

3. After the completion of investigation, the case was
referred to the trial Court who after the conclusion of the
trial acquitted the accused vide judgment and order dated
25.09.2009 on the ground that prosecution has failed to
established its case against the accused-respondents
through direct and circumstantial evidence.

4. Feeling aggrieved, appellant/complainant filed the
present appeal and assailed the impugned judgment and
order on different grounds inter alia that it is based on
non-reading and misreading of evidence; accused are
directly charged in the promptly lodged FIR; the trial
Court did not appreciate the evidence of the prosecution
properly and ignored the evidence which was against the
accused/respondents; the charge of the prosecution is

fully supported by injured witness and_ other
circumstantial evidence in the shape of recoveries and
medical report; it is a day light occurrence and there was
no question of mistaken identity and specific role has
been attributed to each accused.

5. These arguments were rebutted by learned
defence counsel and after taking me through the evidence
on record, contended with vehemence that there is
nothing on record to connect the accused with the crime;
the accused had no motive to kill the deceased as there
was no blood feud enmity between the parties; though the
place of occurrence was surrounded residential area but
no independent witness from general public came
forward to depose against the accused; the report was
made after consultation, deliberation and preliminary
investigation; the learned trial Court after discussing all
the material on record had rightly acquitted the accused.
After acquittal, the respondents earn double presumption
of innocence and there is a heavy onus on the prosecution
to rebut the said presumption but it failed.

6. It needs no reiteration that there is a marked
difference between appraisal of evidence in the appeal
against conviction and in the appeal against acquittal. In
appeal against acquittal, interference is made by the
Appellate Court only when it appears that there has been

gross misreading and non-reading of evidence which
amounts to miscarriage of justice. While considering the
scope of Section 417 Cr.PC it is held that in an appeal
against acquittal, this Court would not in principle,
ordinarily interferes and instead would give due weight
and consideration to the findings of the Court acquitting
the accused. It is equally true that the finding of acquittal
is not sacrosanct, if the reason given by the trial Court are
found speculative or of artificial in nature or the findings
are based on no evidence or is the result of misreading or
misinterpretation of evidence or the conclusion drawn as
to the innocence of accused person, are perverse,
resulting of miscarriage of justice. Same can be interfered
with in appropriate cases in the light of principle laid
down by the apex Court in case 1992 SCMR_ 96
regarding appreciation of evidence.

7. Now keeping in view the above principle in mind
it is to be seen whether the judgment of the trial Court is
perverse, illegal and is based on non-perusal of evidence
and no other decision can be given except that the
accused is guilty and there has been complete misreading
of evidence leading to miscarriage of justice or that the
accused has rightly been acquitted on the basis of
available record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that Lajeel and Barkat

Jamil sons of Habibullah were cited as eyewitnesses of
the occurrence in the first information report but they
were not produced before the learned trial Court for
recording their evidence in support of the prosecution
story as narrated by the complainant in the first
information report. However, eyewitness Barkat Jamil,
who is also witness to the recovery memo Ex:PWS5/2
recorded his statement as PW-5 but he in his entire
statement does not say anything about the manner and
mode of occurrence and his statement was restricted only
in support of the recovery of empty.

9. Dr. Tariq Jadoon, who was examined by the trial
Court as PW-7 has stated that:-

“During the days of occurrence I was posted
as C.M.O at DHO Hospital Mansehra. I, on
07.12.2006 at 06.15 p.m. examined Nawaz
Khan son of Najeem resident of Beherkund
caste Kohistan brought by Muhammad Rafique
constable No.679 P.S Saddar Manserha and
found the following:

1. Since bruise at right ankle region. No
abnormality other then this detected. X-rays of
right ankle has been advised. Today I have
seen the MLC No.1031, which is correct and
correctly bears my signature. I also examined
Abdur Razaq son of Najeem caste Kohistani
aged about 23/24 years resident of Beherkund
vide MLC No.1030/06 dated 07.12.2006 at
06.10 p.m. and found the following.

1. Entry wound on left ankle anterior medially
and anteriorly.

2. Exit wound same side posterialy above both
exit and entry wound communicate to each
other.

X-rays left ankle advised.

Nature of weapon. F.A.I. Today I have seen the
medico legal report which is Ex:PW7/2, while
the report of Nawaz Khan is Ex:PW71.”
XX:- It is correct that on medico legal report
No. 1030/06 Ex:PW7/2 does not bear the word
wound. It is correct that I have not mentioned
the dimention of injury in my report. It is also
correct that I have not mentioned in my
medical report of injured Abdur Razaq about
the mentioning fresh bleeding. It is correct that
I have no mentioned in my reports time
between duration of injury and examination of
injured persons. It is correct that I have not
mentioned the nature of injures in my reports.
It is correct to suggest that it was an old
injury.
However, despite the fact that there is anterior wound on
left ankle caused by firearm weapon having entry as well
exit wounds but the prosecution has failed to place on
record X-Ray or other evidence establishing the fracture
of ankle wound or other surgery conducted by any
doctor. The other aspect of the medical report Ex:PW7/2
is that doctor has failed to mention the dimention of the
injury, whether any fresh blood was present around the
wound and also failed to mention the duration of injury
and examining the injured persons. Hence, these reports
are materially deficient in its contents and do not qualify
to be a material evidence in support of the prosecution
case. Even investigation officer has not taken into
possession shalwar or shoes of the injured to establish

that blood was absorbed as no blood was recovered from

the spot.
10. Normally in hurt cases statement of injured
supported by medical evidence is considered sufficient
towards conviction. In the present case although the
complainant as well as other injured Muhammad Nawaz
have directly charged the present accused-respondents,
however, withholding of ocular account and medical
report if closely perused creates doubt in the manner and
mode of occurrence.

11. It is settled law that the prosecution is duty bound
to prove its case beyond any shadow of reasonable doubt
against an accused person and it is also settled principle
of law that multiple doubts in the prosecution case are
not required to record judgment of acquittal but a single
reasonable doubt is sufficient to extend benefit of the
same to the accused as matter of right. In this regard,
reliance is placed on the esteemed judgment passed in

case titled “Mst. Shamshad Vs The State” 1998 SCMR

854, “Wagar Ahmed Vs_Shaukat_Ali_and_others”
reported as 2006 SCMR_ 1139, case titled “Akhtar Ali
and others Vs The State” reported as 2008 SCMR 6 and
case_titled “Sher _Bahadur_and_ others Vs_The State”
reported as 1997 SCMR 651.

12. On the touch stone of the criteria as mentioned
hereinabove this case has been examined in detail and I

feel that it is neither a case of misreading of evidence and
non-reading of evidence but on the contrary the evidence
has been appreciated in its true perspective and in
accordance with the principle laid down by the apex
Court qua the appreciation of evidence. No illegality or
infirmity could be pointed out warranting interference in
the judgment impugned.

13. In the light of what has been discussed above, the
appeal being devoid of merit is dismissed.
