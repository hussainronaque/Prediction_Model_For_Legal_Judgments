8. The case under Section 302 PPC set
up by the prosecution against the convict-
appellant, Abdul Hameed,is based on the
report of complainant, Kalu Khan, who
charged the convict-appellant for the ‘Qaf/-i-
Amd’ of his son, Muhammad Pervez, at 06.00
PM on 25.09.2004, in his report lodged with
the police at 19.30 hours in the Emergency
Ward of DHQ Hospital, Haripur. The report
shows that the complainant alongwith his
deceased son, who was on one month leave
from Pak Army, 7-FF Lahore Chunnian, was
Certified to be tue Guu, present on the roof of cattle shed of his son-

in-law, Haji Gohar Zaman, in connection with
the marriage ceremony of daughter of the said
Haji Gohar Zaman and his granddaughter.
The report would further show that brother of
Haji Gohar Zaman, the convict-appellant,
emerged on the roof of cattle shed of his
nearby house armed with double barrel 12
bore shotgun and fired two shots at the
deceased, Muhammad Pervez, who was hit
on his chest and neck and succumbed to the
A injuries on his way to the hospital. The
ccurrence was stated to have been
witnessed by Haji Gohar Zaman son of
<hawas Khan and another son in law of the
complainant namely Bashir son of Zardad
Khan, besides other male and female relatives
of the complainant present at the time of
occurrence. The motive for the occurrence
was cited as strained relations between Haji
Gohar Zaman and his brother Abdul Hameed,
the convict-appellant. The immediate cause
was shown as annoyance of the convict-

brother, Haji Gohar Zaman, to participate in
the marriage ceremony of his daughter.

9. The report was lodged by _ the
complainant in the Emergency ward of DHQ
Hospital, Haripur, within 1% hours of the
occurrence, which is, indeed, with utmost
promptitude by all standards. It was urged on
behalf of the defence that a police post (P.P.)
was situated on the way to the hospital, but
report was not lodged there. However, non-
lodging of report in the PP by the complainant
can, by no stretch of imagination, be termed
as a departure from a normal course, as a
father would naturally take his seriously
injured young son to the hospital, in the first
instance, instead of even thinking about taking
him to other places or even to the police post /
police station for first lodging the report.

10. The presence of the complainant
alongwith his son and another son-in-law and
eyewitness Bashir at the residence of his son-
in-law on the eve of marriage ceremony of his

granddaughter and daughter of his son in law,

Haji Gohar Zaman, was but natural. Nothing
has been brought on record even by the
defence to question presence of the
complainant, deceased and eyewitnesses at
the scene of occurrence on the fateful day in
order to participate in the marriage ceremony
of daughter of Haji Gohar Zaman. Besides,
the suggestions/trend of cross-examination of
the defence regarding attack by the
complainant party and alleged firing and
causing firearm injuries to the convict-
appellant and other inmates of the house
would not only show presence of the convict-

appellant, deceased, complainant and

eyewitnesses at the time of occurrence but
would also go a long way to establish and
confirm the scene of occurrence as shown in
the site plan (Ex.PB), which is even otherwise
confirmed by the positive report (Ex.PW 8/3)
of the FSL in respect of blood stained earth
secured from the spot by the I.O and blood
stained garments of the deceased. Needless

Zaman i.e. the scene of occurrence and
house of the convict-appellant adjacent to
each other is not even denied by the defence.
After defence could not establish its plea of
aggression by the complainant party, and
deceased sustaining injury due to the
indiscriminate firing by the complainant party,
particularly in the absence of any report or
even a medical report regarding firearm
injuries sustained by inmates of the house of
the convict-appellant; it, on the other hand,
proved presence of the convict-appellant on
the spot at the time of occurrence. In short,
nothing is forthcoming on behalf of the
defence to show the alleged aggression, thus
falsifying the plea of the defence, and, rather,
reinforcing version of the complainant /
prosecution. (2005 SCMR 810). Moreover,
the postmortem report further belied the
defence plea by showing absence of
blackening or charring marks on the entry
wounds of the deceased, which should have

been there, in all probability, in case the
os)

deceased was hit by the firing of his
companions who were in close proximity with
him.
11. It is something beyond imagination that
the complainant, being a father, would spare
the guilty and charge an innocent person for
the murder of his young son who was on one
month leave from army and was there on the
spot only to participate in the marriage
ceremony of his niece. Not only presence of
— the complainant, deceased and eyewitnesses
at the time of occurrence is natural but
annoyance of the convict-appellant with his
brother was also not something unnatural
when he was not invited by his brother on the
occasion of marriage ceremony of his
daughter.
12. The occurrence took place in the
month of September at 6.00 PM, roughly at
evening time, when there is, normally,
sufficient light. Even otherwise, sufficient
lighting arrangements are made at places

Bm a,

Authereg Urge 33 Ch
Even in the absence of evidence with regard
to availability of lighting facility, no question
could possibly be raised about the
identification of the convict-appellant, being
the real brother of Haji Gohar Zaman and
closely related to the complainant and
eyewitnesses. (2003 SCMR 581 (c)) and
(PLD 1993 SC 895).

The defence forcefully pointed out
absence of place assigned to the complainant
in the site plan in order to raise question about
the admissibility and authenticity of the site
plan, but it lost sight of the fact that the site
plan is not a substantive piece of evidence.
(2005 SCMR 1568) and (PLU 2006
Cr.C.(Peshawar) 635 (DB) ). At the most,
the omission can be attributed to the
incompetency of the 1.0, which should not
dislodge the overwhelming evidence of the
prosecution. In any case, the preparation of
site plan on the pointation of the complainant
would make up the deficiency to a greater
Certified to he True Cons

extent when the cther evidence, including

Fes a ta Tour

Auuponseo Unde peca/5 Sets Grerns,
Casting pra he Lege Cy

recovery of crime empties and blood stained
earth from the spot are proof enough to
confirm the scene of occurrence and thereby
lend credence to the FIR and prosecution
version.
13. The postmortem examination also
substantiated the prosecution case, as all the
firearm injuries on the deceased were found
on the front side, while a slight change in the
direction of the entry wounds can be
— explained in the light of two firing shots from a
double barrel rifle, especially when there is
always a likelihood of change of direction of
the bullet by striking bone tissues, even skin,
muscles, tendons and membranes. (PLJ 2006
Cr.C (Peshawar) 635 (DB ).
14. The prosecution laid much stress on
the failure of the prosecution to prove
recovery of weapon of offence, particularly in
the light of negative report of the firearms
expert relating to the non-matching of crime
empties recovered from the spot with the

. alleged weapon of offence. It may be added
QU olioete es OE NEM

arr ao rae ACE DAES GIP
\

16

here that the convict-appellant has been
acquitted of the charge under section 13 A.O,
and no appeal has been lodged against his
acquittal of the charge. However, it may be
pointed out here that recovery of crime
weapon and empties were pieces of evidence
of corroboration and even if recovery was not
proved in the presence of reliable and
unimpeachable ocular testimony and other
circumstantial evidence, it would not adversely
affect the prosecution case. (2005 SCMR
1568).

15. The next ground of attack of defence
was the non-production of eyewitness Haji
Gohar Zaman; but apart from the fact that the
said PW had since passed away, the order
sheets of the trial Court would show his
presence on a number of occasions, during
his lifetime, without his statement recorded on
one or the other pretext. As such, not only his
non-production can not be attributed to the
prosecution but in the circumstances,

explained above, the prosecution would stand
Certified to be True Copy

Franeser
Pesnawar gh Court
Abpottaned Bench
Austnorized UNE yeca7s Acts Oren

absolved of the responsibility of his
production.

16. The defence also focused on the
weakness of motive for the offence; but it is by
now well established that absence or
weakness of motive would not render case of
the prosecution false or fabricated. (2005
SCMR 1568 (c) ), (2005 SCMR 427), (2006
SCMR 1744), (2006 SCMR 954) and (2008
SCMR 796).

17. On the other hand, there is
overwhelming, confidence inspiring, coherent
and trustworthy evidence in support of the
prosecution case, comprising the promptly
lodged FIR, charge of single accused,
supporting medical evidence and consistent
and mutually corroborative eyewitness
account furnished by the complainant and the
eyewitness, the absence of even distant
possibility of false implication and substitution
of the actual accused, together with abortive

attempt to establish a plea of defence, proved
case of the prosecution against the convict-
appellant beyond any shadow of doubt.

18. Having said that, the reason furnished
by the learned trial Court / Additional Sessions
Judge-ll, Haripur, for awarding the lesser
punishment than the capital one seems also
plausible in view of the fact that the motive, if
any, was against Haji Gohar Zaman and not
against the deceased, who fell victim to the
firing of the convict-appellant when he was in

extreme rage.

19. The last leg of the arguments of
learned counsel for the convict-appellant was
that there was no provision of fine in section
302(b) PPC where-under the convict-appellant
was convicted and sentenced; but the ‘fine’ of
Rs.200,000/- stands clarified as compensation
when the learned trial Court directed that half
of the amount of ‘fine’, if recovered shail be
paid to the legal heirs of the deceased in
terms of section 544-A Cr.P.C as

e Cou compensation. Therefore, Instead of ‘fine’ the
. re fru

amount of Rs.200,000/- is treated as

compensation under section 544-A Cr.P.C;
and to be paid to the legal heirs of the
deceased in accordance with the aforesaid
order / direction of the learned trial Court /
Additional Sessions Judge-ll, Haripur, dated
30.04.2009.

20. In view of the foregoing discussion,
both the appeal of the convict-appellant
against his conviction and sentence and
criminal revision by the complainant for
enhancement of the sentence awarded to the

convict-appellant are dismissed.
