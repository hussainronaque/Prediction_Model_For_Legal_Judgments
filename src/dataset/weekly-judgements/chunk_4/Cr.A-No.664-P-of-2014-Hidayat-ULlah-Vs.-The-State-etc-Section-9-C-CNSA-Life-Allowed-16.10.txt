QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Hidayat Ullah,

appellant, has assailed his conviction under
section 9 (c) CNSA and award of sentences of
imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.100000/-
and in default thereof to further six months
simple imprisonment, while extending him
benefit of Section 382 (b) Cr.P.C; by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-Xll/Judge,
Special Court, Peshawar, vide impugned
judgment/order dated 22.11.2014, in case

registered against the appellant/accused
under section 9 (c) CNSA in Police Station,
Pishtakhara, Peshawar, vide FIR No.840
dated 17.09.2012.

2. The case/FIR was registered on the
report of Syed Naveed Jamal, Inspector
Excise Department, Peshawar, who had prior
information about transportation of narcotics
from tribal territory to settled area in Motorcar
No.LEE-6335 and had laid a barricade on
Ring Road opposite Shesho Mosque along
with officials of the Excise Department,
mentioned in the FIR, and stopped the said
vehicle at 18:40 hours on 17.09.2012. The
driver of the vehicle disclosed his name as
Hidayat Ullah son of Amanullah, the
appellant/accused and checking of the
motorcar led to the recovery of 7/7 packets,
each packet weighing 1/1 kilograms, total 21
kilograms, from three doors of the vehicle,
with the exception of door on the driver side.
According to the complainant/Inspector Excise
Department, 5/5 grams samples’ were

separated from each packet of chars garda
and separately sealed, affixed with 3/3 seals
bearing the impression E&T, whereas the
remaining chars garda was also separately
sealed, and the appellant/accused was
arrested. The complainant/Inspector Excise
Department drafted murasila and sent the
same to the Police Station, where the case
was registered.

3. Investigation in the case was entrusted
to Naurooz Khan SI _ Police Station,
Pishtakhara, who proceeded to the spot and
prepared the site plan on the pointation of the
complainant and eyewitnesses. The samples
separated on the spot after recovery of the
contraband on 17.09.2012 were received in
the office of chemical examiner to
Government of Punjab, Rawalpindi, on
20.09.2012; and report of the Biochemist,
endorsed/countersigned by the chemical
examiner to Government of Punjab,
Rawalpindi, showed the 21 packets containing
chars garda which could “be used to cause

intoxication”. After completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted in the case
by SHO Police Station Pishtakhara,
Peshawar.

4. After receipt of complete challan, the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-
Xll, Peshawar, framed formal charge against
the accused/appellant under section 9 (c)
CNSA, to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to establish its case
against the accused/appellant, the
prosecution examined five PWs, namely,
Sabz Ali Khan SHO/Inspector (PW-1); Syed
Naveed Jamal Inspector Excise Department,
Peshawar (PW-2); Arshad Khan _ Inspector
Excise Department (PW-3); Naurooz Khan
SI, Police Station Pishtakhara (PW-4): and
Saiful Malook SI (Retired) (PW-5): and,
thereafter, closed its evidence; whereafter,
statement of the accused/appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein,
he denied allegations of the prosecution. The
accused/appellant himself appeared and

recorded his statement on oath under section
340 (2) Cr.P.C; and also produced two DWs,
namely, Alamgir Khan (DW-1) and Sher Zada
(DW-2). Following arguments of learned SPP
for the State and learned defence counsel, the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-
X\l/Judge Special Court, Peshawar, rendered
judgment dated 22.11.2014 and _ thereby
convicted the appellant/accused and awarded
him the sentences, mentioned hereinabove;
hence the instant appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG heard; and record
perused.

6. The case was registered against the
appellant/accused under section 9 (c) CNSA
on the report of complainant/Inspector, Excise
Department, despite the fact that the
complainant had received prior information
about transportation of the narcotics from the
tribal territory to the settled area and had more
than one hour to inform the nearby police of
Police Station, Pishtakhara, hardly at a

distance of 2/3 kilometers or 10/15 minutes in
a vehicle from the place of occurrence; as
information, according to his own admission,
was received by the complainant at about
05:00 PM, whereas the time of
occurrence/alleged recovery has been shown
as 18:40 hours. No doubt, the officials of
Excise Department have been legally
authorized to make the recovery of
contraband and initiate a criminal case against
the person from whom the recovery is made,
but in a situation where the local police is
available at a very short distance, the
recovery made by the officials of Excise
Department, in the absence of either officials
from the police department or witnesses from
the general public, would raise serious
questions about the alleged recovery of
narcotics. Needless to say that both the
recovery witnesses and marginal witnesses to
the recovery memo are officials of the Excise
Department, therefore, highly interested; and

as such, their testimony liable to close

scrutiny.
7. The deliberate omission on the part of
the complainant/Inspector, Excise
Department, to also hand over samples of the
recovered narcotics to the local police along
with the vehicle, remaining contraband and
the accused/appellant left much to be desired,
thus casting serious doubt about result of the
chemical examiner; which, indeed, was a
critical piece of evidence in the case of
recovery of narcotics. The samples were,
admittedly, sent to the office of chemical
examiner, Government of Punjab, Rawalpindi,
and not to the FSL, Peshawar, for the reasons
best known to the complainant/Inspector,
Excise Department, not only in violation of the
relevant rules but also in questionable
circumstances, as neither Sher Muhammad,
Inspector Excise and Taxation Department,
who took the samples to the aforementioned
FSL was produced nor evidence was adduced
with regard to safe custody of the samples
with the Excise Department during the

intervening period from the date of recovery
i.e. 17.09.2012 and receipt of the same in the
office of chemical examiner to Government of
Punjab, Rawalpindi, on 20.09.2012. In these
circumstances, the report of chemical
examiner to Government of Punjab,
Rawalpindi, became more vulnerable, which
was already under serious attack from the
defence on the basis of the same emanating
from a Biochemist and simply
endorsed/countersigned by the chemical
examiner. It is, indeed, note worthy that both
in the FIR and throughout in the case of the
prosecution, the recovered chars was
mentioned as garda (in powder shape), but
the seizing officer (PW-2) himself deposed to
the effect that the contraband were in the
shape of slabs.

8. Notwithstanding the fact that no
recovery of contraband was alleged from the
door of the vehicle on the driver side, there is
nothing on the record to establish nexus of the
appellant/accused with the vehicle/motorcar

wherefrom the alleged recovery was made, as
he is neither owner nor proved as driver of the
motorcar; and inspite of recovery of the
registration book from the vehicle, for
unknown and unexplained reasons, the owner
was not made an accused or, at least, a PW
in the case.

9. On the other hand, the
appellant/accused not only recorded his
statement on oath under section 340 (2)
Cr.P.C to the effect of his arrest after a person
made good his escape through his house
when he was present there; and also
established this fact on the basis of
statements of two DWs, namely, Alamgir
Khan (DW-1) and Sher Zada (DW-2).

10. In short, there was nothing on the
available record to establish recovery of
contraband from the possession of the
appellant/accused, warranting his conviction
in the case, and award of sentence of life
imprisonment with fine of Rs:100000/- to him
by the learned trial Court/Additional Sessions

Judge-Xll/Judge Special Court, Peshawar,
vide impugned judgment/order dated
22.11.2014. The appeal is, therefore,
accepted; and the impugned judgment as well
as the sentences awarded to appellant are set
aside. The appellant is acquitted of the
charges, and be set free forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

Announced.
