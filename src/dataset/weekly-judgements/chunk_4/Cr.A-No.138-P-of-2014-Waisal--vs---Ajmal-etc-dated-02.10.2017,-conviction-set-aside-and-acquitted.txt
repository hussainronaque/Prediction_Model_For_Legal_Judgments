QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Wisal, appellant

was convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to _ life imprisonment and
compensation of Rs:300000/-, payable to the
legal heirs of deceased Mst: Sara, by the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge-
Vill, Mardan. Therefore, the convicted

appellant lodged the instant appeal against his
conviction and sentence awarded to him by
the learned trial Court in case vide FIR
NO.752 dated 12.10.2011 under section 302
PPC, registered in Police Station, Pak Hoti,
Mardan, on the basis of murasila of Ali
Rehman Khan S.I; after he found dead body
of an unknown lady having received firearm
injuries.

2. During investigation, an empty shell of
30 bore was recovered and blood stained
earth was also secured from the spot. The
report of chemical examiner about the blood
stained earth secured from the spot and blood
stained garments of the deceased was
positive. The parents of the deceased i.e. her
father, Ajmal Khan, and mother, Zulfan Bibi,
recorded their statements under section 164
Cr.P.C to the effect that their deceased
daughter had developed illicit relations with
the accused/appellant and had left the house
for the house of accused/appellant. They had
not lodged any report, but they were

searching for her, and after recovery of the
dead body of their daughter, they were
satisfied that she was murdered by the
accused/appellant after her abduction. The
appellant/accused was arrested on
16.10.2011, and he, allegedly, made
pointation of the scene of occurrence to the
1.0, who was also handed over a pistol 30
bore by Arif Shop Keeper on the, alleged,
pointation of the accused/appellant. After
remaining in police custody for around three
days, the appellant/accused recorded a
confessional statement before the learned
Judicial Magistrate, Mardan, on 19.10.2011.
The 30 bore empty shell recovered from the
spot and the pistol handed over by Arif Shop
Keeper to the I.O were sent to the firearms
expert, who furnished his report in the
affirmative. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted in the learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-VIll, Mardan,
where the accused/appellant was formally
charged for the offence punishable under

section 302 PPC, to which he pleaded not
guilty and claimed trial. During trial, the
prosecution examined as many as eleven
PWs, including material PWs, namely, Ajmal
Khan (PW-4), father of deceased, Mst: Sara;
Rozi Khan (PW-5); Doctor Seema Sharif (PW-
7); Bakht Jamal Khan S.I/l.0 (PW-9) and
Amanullah Khan, Civil Judge/Judicial
Magistrate (PW-10). After prosecution closed
its evidence, statement of the
accused/appellant was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein, he refuted
allegations of the prosecution against him, but
neither produced defence evidence nor
expressed his wish to be examined on oath.
Thereafter, the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge-Vill, Mardan, found the
appellant/accused guilty of the commission of
offence under section 302 (PPC); and
convicted and sentenced him to _ life
imprisonment and compensation of
Rs:300000/, which, if recovered, was to be
paid to the legal heirs of the deceased as

compensation within the meaning of section
544-A Cr.P.C, and in default of payment of
compensation, the accused/appellant was
further sentenced to six months S.I. Both the
sentences were to run concurrently, and
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was also
extended in favour of the accused/appellant.
Hence the instant appeal by _ the
appellant/accused.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant/accused and learned Assistant A.G,
assisted by learned counsel for the
complainant heard; and record perused.

4. Admittedly, the occurrence was
unseen, as dead body of an unknown lady,
having received firearm injuries, was found by
Ali Rehman Khan S.I; and even, lateron, no
one came forward to furnish eyewitness
account of the occurrence. On 15.10.2011,
the parents of deceased, Mst. Sara, recorded
statements under section 164 Cr.P.C wherein
they not only disclosed this fact that their
deceased daughter had illicit relations with the

appellant/accused and had eloped with him,
but also charged the appellant/accused for the
gatl-i-amd of their daughter. On the following
day of statements of the parents of the
deceased i.e. 16.10.2011, the
accused/appellant was arrested, and on that
very day Shop Keeper Arif handed over pistol
30 bore pistol to the 1.0; and _ the
appellant/accused also recorded confessional
statement, thereby, confessing his guilt of
murder of the deceased who had married him
but was not having good character. As such,
the entire case of the prosecution hinges on
the confessional statement of the
appellant/accused; but the confessional
statement was, admittedly, recorded after the
appellant/accused had remained in police
custody for three days, therefore, no
conviction could be based on this retracted
confession, which also did not receive any
corroboration from rest of the evidence, as
neither report of abduction of their daughter
was lodged by parents of the deceased for

almost 4/5 months of her alleged abduction by
the accused/appellant nor any evidence was
brought on the record to show marriage of the
accused/appellant with the deceased.

5. The other so-called incriminating
evidence against the appellant/accused is the
30 bore pistol which was handed over by
Shop Keeper Arif to the police, and the
firearms expert found the only empty shell of
30 bore having been fired from the same
pistol; but apart from the fact that the pistol
was not recovered from the possession of the
appellant/accused, the said Shop Keeper, Arif,
was also not produced by the prosecution and
abandoned being unnecessary, thus bringing
both the alleged recovery of pistol and report
of the firearms expert under shadow of doubt.
As such, there was_ hardly anything
incriminating on the record to justify conviction
of the appellant/accused and award of Life
Imprisonment to him.

6. Consequently, the appeal is accepted,
and judgment of the _ learned _ trial

Court/Additional Sessions Judge-VIll, Mardan,
dated 09.01.2014, together with conviction of
the appellant/accused and sentences
awarded to him, is set aside. The accused is
acquitted of the charge, and be set free,

forthwith, if not required in any other case.

Announced.
