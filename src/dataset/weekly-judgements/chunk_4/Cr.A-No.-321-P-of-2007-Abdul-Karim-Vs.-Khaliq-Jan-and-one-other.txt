(Judicial Department)

Cr.A No. 321-P/2007

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 28.10.2015

Appellant: (Abdul Karim) by
Mr. Arbab Aziz Ahmad, Advocate

Respondent: (Khaliq Jan) by
Mr. Khwaja Salahuddin, Advocate

(State) by Mr. Rafiq Ahmad, A.A.G.

HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- This single judgment

shall dispose of the instant appeal as well as the

connected criminal appeal preferred by the State

bearing Cr.A No. 343-P/2007, as both the appeals

arise from one judgment of acquittal dated

02.5.2007 of the learned Judge Anti-terrorism Court,

Malakand Division at Swat, delivered in case FIR

No. 139 dated 14.5.2005 under sections 302 PPC

r/w Section 7 (A) ATA and case FIR No. 147 dated

17.5.2005 under section 13 A.O r/w Section 7 (A)
ATA, registered at Police Station Lal Qilla, District

Dir Lower.

2. Precise and relevant facts of the case as

per contents of the FIR are that Azizullah Khan,

SHO Police Station Lal Qilla made a report on

14.5.2005 at 11:40 to the effect that on getting

telephonic information regarding occurrence of

double murder in village Master Abad, he came to

Maktab school of the same village where he found

the dead body of deceased teacher Shah Zamin son

of Abdul Karim. It was disclosed to him that

accused Khaliq Jan had committed the murder of

Shah Zamin by firing at him with his Kalashnikov

and thereafter the accused also committed the

murder of his wife Mst. Mumtaz Begum inside his

home which might have been witnessed by

someone. The accused decamped from the spot after

the occurrence.
The report was recorded in shape of

Mursila Ex.PA/1 on the basis whereof the above

referred FIR (Ex.PA) was registered against the

accused Khaliq Jan.

3. The accused was arrested on 17.5.2005

and was produced before the learned Judicial

Magistrate (Criminal), Lal Qilla, who recorded his

confessional statement on 18.5.2005 wherein motive

was mentioned to be honour kiling. After

completion of usual investigation, complete challan

was submitted in Court of learned Judg, Anti-

terrorism Court, Malakand Division at Swat for trial

of the accused.

The trial Court indicted the accused for

the offence, however, he did not plead guilty thereto

and claimed trial. The prosecution produced and

examined as many as sixteen (16) witnesses in order

to prove its case against the accused whereafter

statement of the accused was recorded under section
342 Cr.P.C wherein he retracted from his

confessional statement and denied the allegations

levelled by the prosecution, however, he neither

wished to produce any evidence in his defence nor

opted to be examined on oath according to section

340 (2) Cr.P.C. After hearing the arguments, the

learned trial Court acquitted the accused of the

charges levelled against him vide judgment dated

02.5.2007 which has been challenged by Abdul

Karim, father of the deceased, through the instant

appeal whereas the State has impugned the same

judgment through the connected Cr.A No. 343-P/

2007 which are being disposed of through the instant

appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellant

contended that although the respondent/accused has

confessed his guilt before the competent Court but

the trial Court has totally ignored the same in sheer

violation of law. He further contended that two
innocent persons have brutally been murdered and

the occurrence was duly witnessed by PW-4 who

recorded his statement but the trial Court also

ignored his statement and acquitted the

respondent/accused without any legal justification.

The learned counsel added that sufficient material is

available on the record in shape of recovery memos,

Medico-legal and FSL_ reports as well as

circumstantial evidence coupled with the conduct of

the accused pursuant to the occurrence which

reasonably connect the respondent with the

commission of the offence but the trial Court, while

recording acquittal of the respondent/accused, did

not appreciate the same evidence as well as the

ocular account of the prosecution witnesses. The

learned counsel concluded that the impugned

judgment of the trial Court is against the law and

evidence available on the record besides, the same is

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
suffering from conjectures and surmises which is not

legally sustainable.

5. Learned counsel for the

respondent/accused contended that prosecution has

badly failed to produce trustworthy and convincing

evidence against the respondent/accused and as such

could not bring home guilt to him. He further

contended that the respondent/accused has retracted

from his confessional statement besides the same

was not recorded in accordance with law, hence, the

respondent/accused cannot be legally convicted on

the basis of such defective piece of evidence. He

further contended that the impugned judgment of the

trial Court is well reasoned which needs no

interference by this Court. Learned counsel for the

respondent/accused concluded that the evidence

produced by the prosecution is suffering from

glaring contradictions, therefore, the trial Court has

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
committed no illegality by acquitting the

respondent/accused from the charge.

6. The learned A.A.G. appearing on behalf

of the State adopted the arguments advanced by the

learned counsel for the appellant and further added

that the material available on the record is sufficient

for conviction of the respondent/accused but the trial

Court has not scrutinized the evidence properly and

acquitted the accused through the impugned

judgment which is against the law and evidence

available on the record.

7. We have heard valuable arguments of

learned counsel for the parties and perused the

record.

8. In light of arguments, perusal of the

record would reveal that the prosecution case mainly

hinges on the confessional statement of the

respondent/accused, statement of eye witness

namely Salimullah (PW-4), medical reports of the
two deceased exhibited as Ex.PW-12/1 and Ex.

PW-12/2, recovery memos of weapon of offence,

empty shells, blood stained clothes and earth/sand

collected from the two spots of occurrence

alongwith positive FSL reports available on the

record as Ex.PW-13/15 and Ex.PW-13/16.

9. Record shows that the

respondent/accused recorded his confessional

statement before the Court of learned Judicial

Magistrate, Lala Qilla on 18.5.2005 the very next

day of his arrest and after three days of the

occurrence, which is available on the record as

Ex.PW-2/1. The learned Judicial Magistrate who

recorded the confessional statement of the

respondent/accused also appeared before the trial

Court, recorded his statement as PW-2 and duly

exhibited the documents and lent support to the

voluntariness of the confession made by the accused

as Ex.PW-2/1 to Ex.PW-2/3. Perusal of the said
exhibits reveal that the Judicial Magistrate has

fulfilled all the legal formalities before recording the

confession and after getting the satisfaction

regarding willingness and voluntariness of the

accused. There is nothing on the record to show that

the confessional statement was recorded as a result

of duress or threat nor it has been proved that the

same statement was illegal or recorded against the

procedure laid down in the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Besides, the PW-2 has been subjected to

lengthy cross-examination but nothing favourable to

the accused has been brought on the record to shatter

the credence either of the confessional statement or

that of the PW-2. Record also shows that the

confessional statement gets support from the

medical reports, recovery of weapon of offence,

statement of PW-4 and the FSL reports available on

the record, hence, there is no reason to discredit the

same. Learned counsel for the respondent/accused

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-10-

contended that the confession being retracted one

cannot be considered for conviction of the accused,

the above contention of the learned counsel carries

no weight because conviction of an accused can

rightly be based on his retracted confession if the

Court is satisfied that the accused voluntarily

recorded the same. In this regard guidance can be

sought from the judgment of the august Supreme

Court of Pakistan reported as “Muhammad Amin

Versus. State” (PLJ 2006 SC 796) wherein it was

held that once confessional statement was found true

and voluntary, conviction could be awarded on the

basis thereof. The august Supreme Court in the

judgment ibid relied on its previous judgment

reported as PLD 1960 SC (Pak.) 313 and also quoted

the relevant portion thereof which is reproduced

herein below for the sake of convenience.

“We are unable to support the
proposition of law laid down by the
learned Judges in this regard. The

retraction of a confession is a
“Manjeet Singh Versus. The State”

-l1ll-

circumstance which has no_ bearing
whatsoever upon the question whether
in the first instance it was voluntarily
made, and on the further question
whether it is true. The fact that the
maker of the confession later does not
adhere to it cannot by itself have any
effect upon the findings reached as to
whether the confession was voluntary,
and if so, whether it was true, for to
withdraw from a _ self-accusing
statement in direct face of the
consequences of the accusation, is
explicable fully by the proximity of
those consequences and need have no
connection whatsoever with either its
voluntary nature, or the truth of the
facts stated. The learned Judges were
perfectly right in first deciding theses
two questions and the answers being in
the affirmative, in declaring that the
confession by itself was sufficient,
taken with the other facts and
circumstances, to support Abdul
Majid’s conviction. The retraction of
the confession was wholly immaterial
once it was found that it was voluntary

as well as true”.

Yet in another judgment reported as

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]

PLD 2006
-12-

Supreme Court 30), the august Supreme Court

observed that:-

“This is settled law that a retracted
confession either judicial or extra-
judicial, if is found truthful and
confidence inspiring and also qualifies
the test of voluntariness, can be used
for conviction without looking for any
other sort of corroboration. The
petitioner, an Indian citizen and being
an illegal immigrant while was working
as an agent of RAW (an Indian
Intelligence Agency) in Pakistan was
arrested as suspect and during the
interrogation, disclosed that he was
deputed to commit terrorist activities in
Pakistan and was involved in the bomb
blast cases referred hereinbefore. The
petitioner having disclosed his mission
in Pakistan, showed his willingness to
make a_ confessional statement,
therefore, he was produced before a
Magistrate, who after satisfying himself
about the willingness and voluntariness
of the petitioner to make the
confessional statement, recorded his
statement wherein he disclosed the
manner in which he caused the

explosion at Lahore and Faisalabad.”
-13-

Record shows that the reasons advanced

by the trial Court for disbelieving the confessional

statement of the accused are strange because he

discredited the same mere on the ground that the

time shown by the Magistrate for recording the

confessional statement of the accused does not

coincide with the time shown by the I.O and other

witnesses. In fact there is no difference as to the

timings of the confession mentioned in Para 5 of the

impugned judgment rather the trial Court

misunderstood the same as the two I.Os namely

Yousaf Ali Khan SHO/SI and Noor Parast Khan S.I

conducted the investigation in the main case

whereas the investigation of case registered under

the Arms Ordinance was conducted by another I.O

and as such the trial Court was wrong while findings

in Para No.5(6). Keeping in view the observations of

the apex Court in the above referred case law and

facts and circumstances of the case, it is held that

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-14-

the respondent/accused voluntarily recorded his

confessional statement and there is no reason before

this Court to agree with the findings recorded by the

learned trial Court regarding the confessional

statement, therefore, it is observed that the learned

trial Court has fallen in error while discarding the

confessional statement for no valid reasons.

10. Coming to the ocular account produced

by the prosecution, record shows that Salimullah,

who is eye witness of the occurrence, appeared

before the trial Court and recorded his statement as

PW-4. Although the witness is 9/10 of age but he

has fully described the episode of arrival of the

respondent/accused at the Maktab school and his

demand from the deceased teacher regarding

issuance of SLC of his kids namely Amjuman and

Ali Hassan. Record shows that the child witness has

amply been cross-examined but there is nothing in

his statement to show that the answers put forth by
-15-

him were not reasonable or rational. The learned

trial Court disbelieved the statement of this witness

mere on the grounds firstly; that his name was not

mentioned in the FIR and site-plan, secondly; the

child witness did not report the matter to his elders

and statement of none of them was recorded to

confirm that the child was present in school at the

time and date of occurrence and thirdly; there is no

mention regarding the signs of bullets on the tables

and chairs of the school. The above reasons shown

by the trial Court for disbelieving the evidence of

the child witness are not relevant and strong enough

to ignore his statement. Statement of this

prosecution witness shows that his evidence is

confidence inspiring and the fact that the eye witness

has not been named in the FIR was not by itself

sufficient to discard his testimony especially when

his statement was recorded under section 161,

Cr.P.C the same very day. Reliance in this regard is

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-16-

placed on the judgment reported as “Muhammad

Basharat Versus. The State and another” (2003

SCMR 554) wherein the august Supreme Court

observed that:-

“Learned counsel has challenged its
authenticity and submitted that had the
witness been present at the spot, his
name would have been disclosed in
F.LR. It is noted that this witness is a
son of the complainant and uncle of the
deceased and was residing in the same
house. His presence at the spot was
natural. Mere fact that he was not
named in F.I.R was not by itself
sufficient to discard his testimony,
which otherwise inspires confidence.
The testimony of a witness cannot be
believed or disbelieved simply for the
reason that his name appears or does
not appear in FIR. Real test is its own
intrinsic value. In our view, High Court

was justified to believe him.”

Thus in view of the above observations

of the apex Court, it is immaterial that the name of

the child witness was not mentioned in the F.I.R but

the material thing is that what the child has deposed

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-17-

needs to be properly appreciated and his evidence

cannot be disbelieved merely because his name was

not mentioned in the FIR especially when his

statement is fully corroborated by other

circumstantial evidence. So far presence of the child

witness on the spot is concerned, record shows that

the I.O has taken into custody photocopies of daily

attendance register through recovery memo Ex.PW-

6/1 which clearly show that the child witness was

present in school on the day of occurrence,

therefore, his presence on the spot was natural and in

our view it is immaterial that statement of an elder

of the witness was not recorded to prove his

presence in school. Learned counsel for the

respondent/accused also vehemently contended that

the witness being underage is not competent to

appear as a witness. This argument of the learned

counsel is also repelled because a child can be a

good witness provided he is _ capable of

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-18-

understanding and be able to give rational answers

to the questions put to him. In the present case, the

child witness is competent to depose as there is no

evidence on the record to make this Court disbelieve

his evidence. Even the august Supreme Court has

observed in a case that no matter if the answers

given by a child witness are not rational if otherwise

statement of the child witness is confidence

inspiring depending upon the circumstances of each

case. Guidance in this respect is sought from the

judgment of the apex Court reported as “Maqsood

Khan Versus. The State” (1982 SCMR 757), the

relevant portion whereof is reproduced herein

below:-

“In a case of a child witness it is
immaterial whether he can understand
and answer in a rational manner the
questions put to him. No general rule of
universal application can be laid down
that in no case should the evidence of a
child witness be believed. Each case
depends upon its particular facts and

circumstances. The evidence of a child

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-19-

witness, before it is acted upon, should,
however, be subjected to a close and
careful scrutiny. The mere fact that the
evidence of the only eye-witness of a
crime is that of a child of 10 years of
age is not a ground for not relying upon
it especially when the evidence was
given without hesitation and without
slightest suggestion of tutoring
anything of the sort and there is
corroboration of the evidence in so far
as it narrates the actual facts or the
child’s subsequent conduct
immediately afterwards. The real tests
are; how consistent the story is with
itself; how it stands the test of cross-
examination and how far it fits with the
evidence and circumstances of the
case.”

If evidence of the child witness is

scrutinized in view of the above referred judgment

of the apex Court, certainly the child witness (PW-4)

in the present case is successful in the tests referred

to above. Moreover, the trial Court has observed that

the child witness is a hired witness by elders of Shah

Zamin but there is nothing on the record from which

such belief of the trial Court could be ascertained.

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-20-

Thus, it is held that the trial Court has not

appreciated in its true perspectives the evidence of

(PW-4).

11. In addition to the above, the medical

reports available on the record as Ex.PW-12/1 and

Ex.PW-12/2 fully corroborate the prosecution case.

The injuries sustained by the deceased Shah Zamin

on front side of his body corroborates the statement

of the eye-witness (PW-4). Similarly, injuries

sustained by the lady deceased on the backside of

her body corroborate the site-plan as well as the

story depicted in the FIR. Moreso, the FSL report

(Ex.PW-13/15) regarding the blood-stained

earth/sand collected from the two spots of

occurrence and the blood-stained clothes of the two

deceased is also in positive which further

strengthens the prosecution version. The witnesses

of the recovery memos prepared in this regard by the

I.O are consistent in their deposition and their
-21-

testimony is intact despite lengthy cross-

examination.

12. Besides, there is recovery of weapon of

the offence on the _ pointation of the

respondent/accused which was handed over to I.O

by brother of the respondent accused and taken into

possession through recovery memo Ex.PW-8/1.

Record also shows that ten empty shells of 7.62 bore

were recovered from the spot where the deceased

Shah Zamin was done to death whereas four empty

shells of the same bore were recovered from the

house of the respondent/accused where he

committed the murder of his wife Mumtaz Begum.

The recovery memos in this regard are available on

record as Ex.PW-7/2 and Ex.PW-7/4. Both sets of

recovery i.e the Kalashnikov and the empty shells,

have been examined through FSL which report is

available on the record as Ex.PW-13/16. This report

shows that the fourteen empty shells from the two
-22-

spots of occurrence have been fired from 7.62 MM

bore SMG rifle, which was recovered at the behest

of the respondent/accused. The above referred

evidence fully supports the prosecution case which

should have been considered by the trial Court. The

conduct of the accused also did not conform to the

ordinary course of nature as in case of the murder of

his wife, at whosoever’s hand and for whatever

reason, he neither lodged FIR nor took his deceased

wife to the hospital, hence, that makes it a relevant

fact for drawing an adverse inference as well.

13. The upshot of the above discussion is

that the prosecution has proved its case beyond any

shadow of doubt against the respondent/accused and

the learned trial Court has not properly appreciated

the evidence available on the record. However, the

statement of child witness coupled with the retracted

confession, though corroborated on material points,

is held to be a mitigating circumstance for not

[Cr-A No. 321-P of 2007 Abdul Karim Vs. Khaliq Jan and one other]
-23-

awarding capital punishment to the respondent

accused. Therefore, we allow this appeal, set aside

the impugned judgment dated 02.5.2007 of the

learned Judge Anti-terrorism Court Malakand

Division at Saidu Sharif Swat, delivered in case FIR

No.139 dated 14.5.2005, under sections 302 PPC

r/w section 7 (A) ATA registered at Police Station

Lal Qilla, District Dir Lower and resultantly convict

respondent-accused Khaliq Jan son of Kamin Khan

under section 302(b) PPC and sentence him to

rigorous imprisonment for life on two counts with

fine of Rs:5,00,000/- as compensation payable to the

legal heirs of the two deceased in equal shares or in

default thereof he shall further undergo one year S.I.

Similarly, he is also convicted under section 13 A.O

and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment

in case FIR No. 147 dated 17.5.2005 registered at

Police Station Lal Qilla. The sentences shall run

concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C. is
-24-

extended to him. The respondent-convict present in

Court is directed to be taken into custody and be

dealt with in accordance with law. The connected

Cr.A No. 343-P/2007 has become infructuous,

therefore, the same is hereby dismissed as such.

14. Above are the reasons for our short

order of the even date announced in the open Court.

Announced.
