vA Perusal of the record would reveal that
during the course of recording the prosecution
evidence, learned counsel for the complainant as
well as learned APP representing the State had
abandoned complainant Redi Gul on 29.11.2018 but
later on learned counsel for the injured submitted an
application before the trial Court on 14.01.2019 with
the prayer that statements recorded by complainant
Redi Gul, DFC Waris Khan and 1.0 Noor Habib Gul
during proceedings u/s 512, Cr.P.C be transferred to
the trial of the present appellant due to their
death/non-availability. The learned trial Court
allowed the said application on the same date
without any notice to the opposite side and
statements of the above-named witnesses including
the complainant were accordingly transferred to the
trial of the present appellant. At the time of final
decision of the case, the learned trial Court has
considered the said statement of complainant Redi
Gul in Para-10 of the impugned judgment without
taking notice of the fact that he had already been
abandoned by prosecution. Admittedly, prosecution
has examined injured Ali Rehman as PW-11,

therefore, transposition of the complainant was

illegal. Once a witness is abandoned by prosecution
then the Court should have never ordered for
transposition of his statement. Since, the learned trial
Court, while convicting the present appellant
through the impugned judgment, has considered the
statement of the said witness which was illegally
transferred, theréfore, . without making any
discussion on merits of ‘the case, it has become
inevitable in the circumstances to remand the case to

trial Court for its decision afresh.

& In view of the above, this appeal is
allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside and the
case is remitted back to trial Court with directions to
decide the case afresh by excluding the statement of
complainant Redi Gul which has illegally been
transposed to the trial of the present appellant, The
learned trial Court is further directed to re-examine
the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C by putting all the
incriminating evidence to him and thereafter decide
the case positively within two months. Needless to
mention that the appellant be treated as under trial
prisoner during the said period. The office shall send

record of the case forthwith to the learned trial Court
