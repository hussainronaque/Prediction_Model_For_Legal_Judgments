HAIDER ALI KHAN, J.- This criminal appeal is

directed against the judgment dated 06.6.2015 of the

learned Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi,

Swat at Kabal, delivered in case FIR No. 237 dated

29.11.2013 registered under sections 496-A/

496-B/203/379/34 PPC at Police Station Shah

Dherai, District Swat whereby the appellants were

convicted and sentenced as under:

fine of Rs.10,000/- or in default

thereof to suffer further two months
S.1.

ii) Under Section 496-B/34 PPC to

S.1.

Appellant Mst. Naseema

Under Section 496-B/34 PPC to

Rs.10,000/- or in default thereof two
months S.I.

2. Precise and relevant facts of the case are

that the complainant Bakht Sherwan on 27.11.2013

reported to the local Police Station Shah Dherai to

the effect that his daughter Mst. Naseema, who was

already engaged to one Abdur Raziq through a valid

Nikah, was enticed away by Ajab Khan on the

previous night for the purpose of contracting illegal

marriage with her. The complainant further reported

that Mst. Naseema also took away gold ornaments

weighing 5 tolas owned by his daughter-in-law Mst.

Khaista Bibi. Report of the complainant was

recorded vide Daily Diary No. 11 dated

27.11.2013, on the basis whereof Murasila Ex.PA

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
was drafted which lastly culminated in registration

of FIR, Ex.PA against both the accused namely Ajab

Khan and Mst. Naseema (the appellants herein).

3. After arrest of the accused and

completion of investigation, challan was submitted

in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate who

formally indicted the accused for the offences. The

accused pleaded not guilty and opted to face the trial

whereafter evidence of the prosecution was

recorded. Thereafter, statements of the accused

under Section 342, Cr.P.C were recorded wherein

they professed their innocence, however, neither

they felt need of producing any evidence in their

defence nor they opted to be examined on oath

under section 340(2), Cr.P.C. After hearing the

arguments, the learned Judicial Magistrate came to

the conclusion that the prosecution has successfully

proved its case against the accused, however, it was

opined by the learned Judicial Magistrate that award

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
of sentence more that three years imprisonment

would be in excess of his jurisdiction, therefore, the

accused were taken into custody and the case was

sent to the learned Sessions Judge, Swat vide order

dated 17.4.2015 with the request of carrying out

further proceedings. On receiving the case, the

learned Sessions Judge entrusted the same to the

learned Additional Sessions Judge, Swat at Kabal

who rendered the impugned judgment of conviction

dated 06.6.2015 after hearing arguments of the

parties. Being aggrieved of their conviction, detail

mentioned in para No.1, the appellants have

preferred the instant appeal before this Court.

4, Learned counsel for the

appellants/convicts contended that the impugned

judgment of the learned trial Court is against the law

and facts on the record; that the witnesses produced

by the prosecution are highly interested, therefore,

their testimony cannot be legally relied upon for

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
conviction of the appellants/convicts; that the

learned trial Court has failed to properly analyze the

evidence according to the settled principles of law

besides, the prosecution has badly failed to prove its

case against the appellants/convicts; and that there

are glaring contradictions in the statements of the

prosecution witnesses but the trial Court ignored

them and recorded the impugned judgment of

conviction which has resulted in miscarriage of

justice to the appellants/convicts, hence, the same is

not legally maintainable.

5. On the contrary, learned counsel for the

complainant as well as the learned A.A.G appearing

on behalf of the State argued that the available

evidence on the record is sufficient in bringing home

guilt to the appellants/convicts, therefore, the

learned trial Court has committed no illegality while

convicting them after proper appraisal of the

material available on the record. It was lastly

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
contended that the act of the appellants/convicts is

against Sharia as such, they have got what they

deserved in accordance with law, therefore, the

impugned judgment of conviction rendered by the

learned trial Court in no manner warrants

interference of this Court.

6. I have heard the arguments of learned

counsel for the parties and have gone through the

record.

7. According to the prosecution version,

the appellant Ajab Khan enticed away the co-

appellant Mst. Naseema for the purpose of illegal

marriage despite the fact that Nikah of

Mst. Naseema had already been effected with one

Abdur Raziq. In support of its above contention, the

prosecution has produced and exhibited the alleged

Nikah Nama dated 13.11.2012 as Ex.PW-4/1. A bare

perusal of the said Nikah Nama reveals that the same

has neither been signed or thumb impressed by the

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
husband Abdul Raziq nor it bears the signature or
thumb impression of the appellant/convict
Mst. Naseema. Although it is also the stance of the
prosecution that consent of the appellant
Mst. Naseema had been obtained by her
Wali/attorney namely Lal Muhammad (PW-5) who
is her maternal uncle, but astonishingly the
purported Nikah Nama Ex.PW-4/1 does not bear his
signature or thumb impression neither in the
capacity of a Wali nor as her attorney. Another
witness namely Pacha Gul (PW-6) who recorded his
statement regarding the said Nikah Nama, stated in
his cross-examination that:

Jp ape wali CIS Aine ga AS 2 Cua A"
5 fas onclils Solog LE LS LY cIKi Ci gs Ge
Med wali 183

According to this witness, the Nikah
Nama which he signed as a witness was in duly
printed form but perusal thereof reveals that it was
on a plain paper which does not carry signature or

thumb impression of this witness i.e PW-5.

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
Moreover, as observed earlier, no prescribed Nikah

Form was used for the purpose nor the same was

registered by the authority concerned. Similarly, the

Nikah Nama (Ex.PW-4/1) was neither signed by the

appellant/convict Mst. Naseema nor by _ her

Wali/attorney, therefore, its status has become

highly doubtful.

8. Another important aspect of this case is

the age of the appellant/convict Mst. Naseema at the

time of her previous Nikah. Although, the

prosecution has badly failed to prove the factum of

the alleged former Nikah between the appellant

Mst. Naseema and Abdur Raziq, however, if the

same be considered as proved for a while even then

it is of no avail to the prosecution. It is evident from

the statements of prosecution witnesses especially

PW-5 that the appellant Mst. Naseema was 13/14

years of age at the time of the alleged Nikah. There

is no authentic document on the record to show her

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
exact age, however, the appellants have contracted

marriage and out of the wedlock they have an

offspring who is being taken care of by the relatives

of appellant Ajab Khan. So far as validity or

otherwise of this marriage is concerned, the status of

the previous Nikah has already been held as

doubtful, therefore, the said offspring cannot be left

on the mercy of the society to be branded a result of

adulterous relationship because the future of a child

is also to be considered by this Court. Record also

shows that the appellant Mst. Naseema has got a

decree for dissolution of her marriage with Abdur

Raziq by exercising her right of puberty. The

relevant portion of the order dated 25.11.2015 of the

learned Civil Judge-IV/Family Court is as under.

“In the circumstances of the case,
the parties cannot live together
within the limits prescribed by
Almighty Allah, therefore, plaintiff is
held entitled for the decree of
dissolution of her marriage with the
defendant on the basis of Khula as

alternative relief, in consideration of

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
-10-

dower which shall be deemed to have
been waived by the plaintiff. Ex parte
decree is accordingly granted in favour

of the plaintiff.”

9. No doubt, marriage by a girl without

getting the consent of her parents/Wali as well as the

act of elopement, have always been considered as

detestable by Sharia and by the customs of the area,

however, both the appellants have exercised their

option of to tie the knot being adult and sane citizens

which is not prohibited by the law of the land.

10. In view of what has been discussed

above, I allow this appeal, set aside the impugned

judgment dated 06.6.2015 rendered by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi zilla Qazi, Swat at

Kabal, delivered in case FIR No.237 dated

29.11.2013, under sections 496-A/496-B/203/379/34

PPC registered at Police Station Shah Dherai,

District Swat and resultantly acquit the appellants

Ajab Khan and Mst. Naseema of the charge levelled

Tajamul/Ps* ULCr.A No: 137-M of 2012 Muhib-ur-Relmaw Vs. The State}
-ll-

against them. They be released forthwith if not
required in any other case.

Above are the reasons of my short order
of the even date announced in the open Court.
Announced.
