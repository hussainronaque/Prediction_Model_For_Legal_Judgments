Cr.A No. 406-P/2014.

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 08.10.2015.

Appellant (Fazal-ur-Rehman) By Ms. Farhana Marwat, Advocate.

State By Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Mohmand,
SPP for ANF.

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J. Through this appeal,
the appellant has questioned the judgment of the learned
Judge Special Court (CNS) Peshawar dated 23.5.2014
whereby the vehicle of the appellant was confiscated to
the State.

2. The prosecution case as per FIR is that on
23.2.2013 having received spy information that inter
provincial smuggler namely, Farid, resident of Bara
would smuggle huge quantity of narcotics from
Peshawar through his agents to Karachi via Kohat
through bus bearing registration No. JA-6851 Karachi,
S.I Raja Shoaib Ahmad (PW-2) arranged a raiding party
alongwith other ANF staff and held nakabandi at the
crime spot when at 19:40 hours the said bus coming
from Dara Adamkhel side was signaled to stop for the
purpose of checking. The bus was carrying 31
passengers and three crew members. The person sitting
on the driving seat disclosed his name as Ijaz Khan s/o

Meerdil while the person sitting alongwith him on the
‘Tapa’ disclosed his name as Meer Khatam and the
person sitting on the VIP seat disclosed his name as
Habib Khan s/o Gul Habib being 2" driver of the bus.
On cursory interrogation all the three accused separately
disclosed and pointed out the presence of narcotics i.e.
charas garda hidden in both sides of the bus. He
prepared the pointation memo on the spot duly signed
by the marginal witnesses. As a precautionary measure,
the owner/ conductor of the bus namely, Meer Khatam,
was asked to return the ticket fare and luggages of the
passengers to them and the passengers were let free. The
bus alongwith three accused was brought to the Police
Station for thorough search. During search in the
presence of the three accused and marginal witnesses
both the sides of the bus were opened with different
tools and on thorough search 79 packets of charas garda
which was wrapped in white envelopes as well yellow
solution tape were recovered which on weighment total
turned out to be 94.800 Kgs. 10/10 grams from each
packet of charas garda were separated for FSL
examination while the remaining packets were sealed
into four plastic sacks. The accused were arrested, the
narcotics and the bus were taken into possession and the
FIR ibid was registered against the accused.

3. Investigation commenced and at its conclusion,
complete challan was submitted against the accused

before the learned trial Judge who after holding a full
dressed trial convicted and sentenced the accused
through the impugned judgment and also confiscated the
bus to the State, hence the appeal.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the
vehicle in question is the sole ownership of the appellant
and there is no rival claimant of the same; that the
learned trial court has committed serious illegality by
not complying with the provisions of sections 32 and 33
of the CNSA; that the appellant was unaware regarding
use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence and
that the vehicle has been parked in the Police Station in
the open sky and its condition is deteriorating day by
day. Therefore, the appellant prays for the return of the
vehicle being the bonafide owner of the same.
4. The learned SPP appearing for the State
supported the impugned judgment on almost the same
grounds as mentioned therein.

Arguments heard and available record perused.
5. The appellant seeks the return of bus bearing
registration No. JA-6851 claiming to be its bonafide
owner. As detailed above, from the same very bus being
driven by Ijaz Khan and accompanied by his co-accused
Meer Khatam and Habib Khan, 94.800 KGs of Charas
Garda were recovered and the bus was thus impounded
on 23.2.2013. After the commencement of trial, the
appellant submitted an application to the learned trial

Judge for the return of the vehicle on superdari on
14.6.2013. Thereafter, as the entire order sheets reveal,
the matter was adjourned at the request of the learned
counsel for the appellant for arguments alongwith the
main case. No effort was made by the appellant to
associate himself with the trial proceedings so as to
prove his alleged title of the vehicle and he only
watched the trial of the accused from the sidelines. As
per the registration book, the vehicle is registered in the
name of one Ghulam Hussain. The appellant derives his
title from Ghulam Hussain on the basis of an affidavit
dated 4.10.2012. However, the said document was not
produced during trial by the appellant. As per Iqrar
Nama dated 10.1.2013 which was exhibited during the
trial of the accused as Ex.P-13, the appellant had
allegedly sold the vehicle to Iran Badshah s/o Shah
Jehan (absconding accused) and brother of Meer
Khatam, convict-appellant through payment of certain
installments as detailed in the Iqrar Nama. When the
vehicle was taken into custody in case FIR No.03 dated
23.2.2013, only then the appellant surfaced and laid
claim over the vehicle through the said Iqrar Nama.
However, he stayed back during the trial and made no
serious effort to unearth the truth about his association
with the absconding accused, Iran Badshah, till the trial
was concluded and through the impugned judgment
besides the conviction and sentence of the three accused,

the bus in question was also confiscated to the State.
Admittedly, the vehicle is not registered in his name and
the appellant is only brandishing an affidavit in his name
by the registered owner namely, Ghulam Hussain, and
the onward sale of the vehicle through Iqrar Nama by
the appellant in favour of Iran Badshah. The
surreptitious manner through which the appellant has
proceeded all along right from the submission of his
application before the learned trial Judge and thereafter
displaying an altogether indifferent attitude towards the
court proceedings, speak volumes for his conduct.
Lately, it has been noticed that the narco Dons and their
clandestine mafias engaged in this illegal trade have
adopted various modus operandi to oversee the smooth
running of their lucrative business and the same also
includes securing the release of the vehicles involved in
the narcotics smuggling which either belong to them or
registered in the names of their small minions and petty
agents.

For the foregoing reasons, this appeal being
devoid of any substance stands dismissed.
