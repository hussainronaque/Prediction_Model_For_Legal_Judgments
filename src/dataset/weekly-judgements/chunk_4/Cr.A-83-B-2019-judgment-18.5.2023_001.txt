JUDGMENT

Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL, J.-

This appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 05.12.2018 of the Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Bannu, whereby he acquitted the respondent-accused,
namely, Wali Ullah, alias, Qismat Ullah, from the
charges leveled against him. The respondent-accused
was tried u/ss. 302/34, PPC, having been charged in a
case registered vide FIR No. 08 dated 24.06.2013, at

Police Station Jani Khel, District, Bannu.

2. The brief facts of the case are that on
24.06.2013, the complainant Muhammad Younas Khan
son of Barray Khan present with the dead body of his
deceased mother Mst. Janeka Bibi reported to the local

police in the Civil Hospital District Bannu that on

23.06.2013, the day of incident, he along with his
parents and other inmates of the house, was present in
their house in Malak Shahi Jani Khel. At about 16:00
hours, Badshah Ali Khan (absconding accused) empty
handed and his son Qismat Ullah (respondent-accused),
armed with a Kalashnikov, came and started altercation
with the father of the complainant. Meanwhile, on the
command of co-accused Badshah Ali Khan
(absconding), the respondent/accused fired at the parents
of the the complainant with the intention to commit their
Qatl-e-amd. Resultantly, they both were hit and fell to
the ground. After the incident, the accused made good
their escape from the spot. On attending his injured
parents, the complainant found that they succumbed to
their injuries. The complainant added that later, accused
came back and took forcibly the dead body of his father
for burial. He alleged that he could not rush the dead
body of his mother to the hospital on time because
transport was not available. Motive behind the
occurrence was stated to be land dispute between father

of the complainant and respondent-accused (his uncle).

3. After completion of the investigation,
complete challan was submitted against them before the

learned trial Court. Accused were absconding, therefore,

“Imranuttak PS* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-3-
proceedings u/s. 512, Cr. P.C were initiated against
them and they were declared proclaimed offenders on
18.03.2014. The respondent/accused Wali Ullah, alias,
Qismat Ullah was arrested on 27.02.2017. Copies were
supplied to him in compliance with section 265-C, Cr.
PC. Charge was framed against him, to which he

pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

4, The prosecution examined as many as
twelve (12) PWs. Statement of the respondent/accused
u/s. 342, Cr. P.C, was recorded, in which he was given
opportunity of evidence in defence and/or statement on
oath, but he did not avail it. After hearing the arguments,
the respondent/accused was acquitted from the charges
leveled against him by the learned trial Court vide the

impugned judgment dated 05.12.2018.

5. We have heard arguments of learned AAG

for the State/appellant and perused the record.

6. The prosecution case mainly rests on the
evidence of Muhammad Younas Khan (PW-9), the
complainant [son of both the deceased, Baray Khan
(father) and Mst. Janeka Bibi (mother)]. Admittedly, in
the year 2013, in which the incident took place (on
23.06.2013), he was 15 years old. His statement at the

trial was recorded on 20.12.2017. While the incident

‘*Imranullah PS* (DB) HON'BLEMR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR_ JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-4-
took place at 16:00 hours in village Malik Shahi Jani
Khel, he reported it to the police on 24.06.2013, the next
day at 10:30 a.m, with a delay of about 18 hours. As per
his statement, he lodged the report in the civil hospital
Bannu, at which time he had shifted the dead body of
his mother. The report of the incident shows that at the
relevant time Badshah Ali Khan and respondent/accused
Wali Ullah alias Qismatullah s/o Badshah Ali Khan
entered the house of the complainant party. Badshah Ali
Khan (absconding accused) was stated to be the brother
of deceased Baray Khan and father of the present
respondent/accused. The respondent/accused was stated
to have been in possession of a Kalashnikov and the
absconding accused empty handed. The latter started an
altercation with Baray Khan, his brother. He, then,
ordered the respondent/accused to open fire at Baray
Khan and his wife Mst. Janeka Bibi, to kill them.
Accordingly, the respondent/accused was alleged to
have opened the fire at both. As a result of his firing,
both died on the spot. The complainant further stated
that he and his other siblings were present in the house.
After sometime, the accused party forcibly removed the
dead body of Baray Khan and buried it. He further
deposed that due to non-availability of traffic, he could

not took the dead body of his mother to the hospital.

‘“Imranutich PS* (D.B)_HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-5-
However, with the help of his relatives, he was able to
take it to the hospital where his report was registered
and the postmortem examination of the dead body was
performed. Motive for the occurrence was stated to be

disputed over landed property.

7. From the site plan, prepared at the instance
of the complainant, it appears that the houses of both the
parties are adjacent to each other. The points at which
mother of complainant was hit, the places at which both
the accused were present and the place at which he was
present, were pointed out. But the place at which his
father deceased Baray Khan was present and hit, was
not shown. It is pertinent to mention that no evidence
was collected by the Investigating Officer in respect of
the deceased Baray Khan whose dead body was
allegedly shifted by the accused party forcibly from the
spot and buried. The Investigating Officer made no
application to the Judicial Magistrate for exhumation of
his dead body. Surprisingly and shockingly, an
application was moved in this respect in the year 2017,
which was dismissed, In the year, 2017, the complainant
submitted an application to the Police Department which
was considered by the Regional Review Board, which

directed reinvestigation along the following lines:-

‘“Imrenultah PS* (D.B) HON'BLEMR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-6-

“28. Later on, when the case was put in
Court and proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C,
commenced against the accused, the
complainant filed an application to the high-
ups of the police, which was routed to the
RRB (Regional Review Board) in 2017. The
board held its meeting and in the minutes of
the said meeting, it was cited that there are
lacunas in the investigation of the instant
case and;

a) The statements of eye-witnesses have not
been recorded.

5) No place has been attributed to Baray
Khan deceased.

c) Investigating officer did not verify the
murder of Baray Khan by recording
Statements of those, who attended his
funeral nor located his grave for autopsy
etc. If the deceased was buried in tribal
areas, the political authorities have not
been addressed in the matter.

da) The reasons for delay of around 24 hrs,
in lodging the FIR have not been dug
out.”

8. Though photographs were produced which
were shown as those of the grave of the deceased Baray
Khan. However, it was not convincingly proved that the
grave was indeed of the afore-said deceased. Even
otherwise, nothing substantial could have been come out

of that exercise.

9. Coming to the remaining evidence of the
prosecution, no recovery of empties was shown in the
site plan. In the first report of the incident recorded in
the shape of the murasila, the complainant explained the
delay by stating that public transport was not available

on the eventful day. While under cross-examination, he

‘*imrannflak PS* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IQBAL
-7-
changed his stance, stating that curfew was imposed in
the area. The Investigating Officer collected no
evidence, either regarding non-availability of the traffic
or curfew in the locality. The complainant stated that the
Police Station Jani Khel is situated at a short distance
from his house where one can reach within half-an-hour.
He also stated that he went to the village of his maternal
uncles to arrange a vehicle for shifting the dead body of
his mother to the hospital. However, he did not approach
to the Police Station. It follows that on the face of the
record, the long delay in lodging the report was not
convincingly explained. Keeping in view the fact that
the complainant could reach to the Police Station within
30 minutes, he could take the dead body of his mother
there and also lodge the report. It is not appealing to a
prudent mind that he waited till the next day late in the
morning to lodge the report in the civil hospital Bannu
situated at a long distance from his village in North
Waziristan, particularly while Police Station, as per his
own version, was situated at a short distance from the

place of occurrence.
11. In the site plan, the deceased Mst. Janeka

Bibi was shown to have been present in front of the wall

between the houses of the parties. Allegedly, she was

*Imranultah PS* (D.B) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-8-
present at point-1, near the wall separating the aforesaid
two houses. The respondent/accused was shown at
point-4 while firing at her. It was natural that the wall
would have been hit with the fire shots. But, as the
Investigating Officer (PW-11) stated in his cross-
examination, no marks of bullets strikes were founds on
the aforesaid wall. The complainant stated in his first
report that the occurrence was also witnessed by other
family members. He did not mention any one of them by
name. However, the prosecution examined his sister
Mst. Sona Bibi (PW-10). In her examination-in-chief,
she stated nearly the same story about the incident.
What happened soon after the occurrence, she disclosed

like this:

“The accused left the spot while we
attended for parents they were found dead.
We shifted the dead bodies to the Cots with
help of our co-villagers, later on the accused
along with our another Chacha came there
and forcibly took the dead body of my father
Sor burial.”

12. The above statement is not appealing to a
prudent mind. The reason needless to say is that if she
and the complainant were lifting up the dead bodies of
their parents to put them on Cots with the help of their
co-villagers, how could the accused along with other
uncles took the courage to forcibly remove the dead

body of their father. In the natural course of events, an

‘*hmranuilak PS* (DB) HON'BLEMR JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-9-
accused party, no matter in whatever brutal manner they
might have committed a murder, would not have the
audacity to come back, and that too, in the presence of
so many people. While under the cross-examination, she
said:

“The house of my Mamoo is visible
Srom our house. After hearing the firing first
the women folk of our Mamoo house came
while the male members of my Mamoogan
Samily had reached later on. The other co-
villagers also came to our house. The co-
villagers had attracted just after the
occurrence, however, the exact time has not
known to me. I had disclosed the occurrence
to the co-villagers who attracted to the spot.
After the occurrence when we had shifted
bodies of both the deceased to the Cots
thereafter the accused along with Abad Khan
(my Chacha) again came and took away the
dead body of deceased.”

13. Two points are worth consideration in the
light of the above statement. Firstly, it contradicts the
statement of the complainant, her brother who deposed
that he went to the village of his maternal uncles.
Secondly, if the house of their material uncles was near
their house, their maternal uncles would have surely
come to the spot soon after the occurrence and would
have helped them not only to lodge the report promptly
but would have also prevented the accused party from

shifting the dead body of their father.

14, On the above reappraisal of evidence, we

have reached to the conclusion that the prosecution has

‘*tmranuBah PS* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-10-
failed to bring home guilt against the
respondent/accused. Before parting with this judgment,

we would like to make a few observations.

15. Firstly, though the incident was reported
with a considerable delay, it was not efficiently and
honestly investigated. If at all the dead body of Baray
Khan was forcibly removed from the place of the
occurrence and buried, the investigating officer had the
duty to probe it to the best of his abilities. He should
have recorded statements of the residents of the locality.
He should have also moved an application for
exhumation. Indeed that was the proper time for
exhumation. By referring to the timely exhumation we
mean its quick and proper effects on investigation of the
case. We are conscious of the fact that though there is
no time limit for exhumation in medical jurisprudence in
our country, and for example, England and India.
However, the time limit is 10 years in France and 30
years in Germany (Faryad Ali v. The State, 2008 SCMR
1086. Also see Muhammad Magsood et al,
‘Exhumation—Can Dead Tells Tales?’, 7(4) Journal of
Fatima Jinnah Medical University Lahore, 48). In the
case in hand, the cause of the death (one of reasons for

exhumation) of Baray Khan was known being the result

“terenalich FS~ (DB) HON'BLE MR JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-11-
of fire arm injuries, it would have helped in
identification of the dead body to confirm its
individuality for the purpose of the crime of his murder.
Despite no bar on time limit, exhumation after a longer
time would tend to have lesser chances of its help. In
this perspective, the following observation from the

above cited research essay may be helpful:

Success regarding finding cause of
death depends upon condition of
corpse at the time of exhumation and
the time duration lapsed since death.
Nasib. R. Awan says in his book that
the cause of death lay in the vital
organs or systems composed of soft
tissues. When a soft tissue has been
affected adversely by advanced
decomposition, no definite opinion

My about the cause of the injury and
nature of wound whether it is ante
mortem or post mortem, can be

expressed with certainty.

16. Secondly, no one from amongst the
relatives -and/or other residents of the village came
forward to spell out the truth about this highly
unfortunate incident. We are sure it must have deeply
shaken the entire village when the parents of the
complainant and his siblings were done to death at the
one the same time and right in front of them. While the
Investigation Officer couldn’t be exonerated from his
legal and professional responsibilities, people from the

village, too, owed a moral obligation to have helped him

‘*furanuliak PS* (D.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON’BLE MR, JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-12-
by recording statement. Indeed, giving evidence is a
legal duty. The Holy Qur’an commands: (Urdu

Translation):

Klay? Musca 97 Little tgeslpaseoS, froopasl
ret Her etherte stare A a (283 Ae ic F Ze

17. We find that the trial Court has properly
appreciated the evidence on the record and arrived at a
correct conclusion, while recording acquittal. It is worth
observing that an accused person, as a matter of right, is
presumed to be innocent before the trial Court unless the
charge is proved against him/her. Acquittal at the trial
gives rise to double presumption of innocence for an
accused. An appellate Court needs to be cautious while
considering the evidence and should avoid reversal of an
acquittal, unless it finds that the acquittal is perverse,
conjectural, arbitrary, jurisdictionally defective and
prompted by mis-reading or non-reading of evidence.
Even if a contrary view is formed on re-appraisal of
evidence, it should not be used to disturb an acquittal,
provided convincing evidence is available on the record
to reverse acquittal. In this respect, reference may be
made to the judgment of the Apex Court rendered in the

case of Jehangir vs. Aminullah_& others reported as
2010 SCMR 491, wherein it was held:

*imranuiiak FS* (D.B) HON'BLEMR JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-13-

“It is well-settled by now that there are
certain limitations on the power of the
Appellate Court to convert acquittal into a
conviction. It is well-settled that Appellate
Court would not interfere with acquittal
merely because on reappraisal of the
evidence it comes to the conclusion
different from that of the Court acquitting
the accused, provided both the
conclusions are reasonably possible. If,
however, the conclusion reached by that
Court was such that no reasonable person
would conceivably reach the same and
was impossible then this Court would
interfere in exceptional cases on
overwhelming proof resulting in
conclusive and irresistible conclusion;
and that too with a view only to avoid
grave miscarriage of justice and for no
other purpose. The important test
visualized in these cases, in this behalf
was that the finding sought to be
interfered with, after scrutiny under the
forgoing searching light, should be found
wholly as artificial, shocking and
ridiculous. The view taken by this Court
in Ghulam Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan
PLD 1985 SC 11 is well-known that "in
an appeal against acquittal this Court
would not, on principle, ordinarily
interfere and instead would give due
weight and consideration to the findings
of Court acquitting the accused. This
approach is slightly different from that in
an appeal against conviction when leave
is granted only for the re-appraisement of
evidence which then is undertaken so as
to see that benefit of every reasonable
doubt should be extended to the accused.
This difference of approach is mainly
conditioned by the fact that the acquittal
carries with it the two well-accepted
presumptions: one initial, that, till found
guilty, the accused is innocent; and two
that again after the trial a Court below
confirmed the assumption of innocence.
This will not carry the second
presumption and will also thus lose the
first one if on points having conclusive
effect on the end result the Court below:
(a) disregarded material evidence; (b)
misread such evidence; (c) received such

‘“mranullah PS* {D.B) HON'BLEMR. JUSTICE FAZAL SUBHAN
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IQBAL
-14-

evidence illegally". This principle was
also followed in Muhammad Iqbal v.
Sanaullah PLD 1997 SC 569, State v.
Farman Hussain PLD 1995 SC' 1,
Ghulam Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan PLD
1985 SC 11, Ahmad v. Crown PLD 1951
FC 107, Abdul Majid v. Superintendent
of Legal Affairs, Government of Pakistan
PLD 1964 SC 426, State y. Bashir PLD
1997 SC 408, Muhammad Sharif v.
Muhammad Javed PLD 1976 SC 452,
Shahzado y. State PLD 1977 SC 413;
Farmanullah v. Qadeem Khan 2001
SCMR 1474 and Khadim Hussain vy.
Manzoor Hussain Shah 2002 SCMR
261.”

18. The upshot of the above discussion is that
while upholding the acquittal, we dismiss the instant

appeal in Jimine.
