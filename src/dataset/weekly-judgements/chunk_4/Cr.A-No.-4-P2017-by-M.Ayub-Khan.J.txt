Paindakhel, AAG

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J-. Through this

criminal appeal under section 417 Cr.PC, State through
Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar has
called in question the judgment dated 08.10.2016 passed
by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Nowshera
whereby accused/respondent Nazim Ali, charged in case
FIR No.444 dated 07.07.2013 under sections 302/324/34
PPC registered at Police Station Nowshera Cantt was

acquitted.
2. Brief facts of the case as per FIR are that on

07.07.2013 at 01:30 hours complainant Suleman
accompanied the dead body of his brother namely
Muhammad Zaman at Mortuary of DHQ, Hospital,
Nowshera Kalan whereby he reported the matter to the
local police that on 06.07.2013, he alongwith his brother
Muhammad Zaman (deceased) were coming from
Peshawar to their house after earning their daily
livelihood, when they reached to the place of occurrence
ic. Pir Sabaq Guddar, the accused Nazim Ali and
absconding co-accused Azmat Ali were already present
there, started firing at them with the intention to commit
their Qatl-e-Amd. Resultantly, his brother Muhammad
Zaman got hit and died on the spot while he escaped
unhurt. Motive behind the occurrence was stated to be
previous enmity, he charged the accused party for the
murder of his brother namely Muhammad Zaman and
for attempt at his life, hence this FIR.

3. After completion of investigation challan was

put in Court, Charge was framed against the accused to
which he did not confess his guilt and claimed trial. In
order to prove its case, prosecution produced PW-1
Muhammad Saleem Khan SHO, who incorporated the
contents of murasila into FIR Ex.PW1/1. PW-2 Suleman
who is the complainant of the instant case. PW-3 is Dr.

Salik Kashif (Rtd), who stated that during those days he
was posted as Medical Officer in DHQ Hospital,
Nowshera Kalan and on 07.07.2013 at about 02:30 hours
he conducted postmortem examination of deceased
Muhammad Zaman brought by Amjid Khan and found
the following injury:
1. 1x] cm wound on left forehead, 2 cm above.the
lateral margin of left eyebrow (near hair line).
2. 2x2 cm exit wound at junction of right parieto-
occipital region just behind the upper margin
of right ear.
PW-4 Said Ahmad Khan SI (Rtd), is the Investigation
Officer of the instant case. He prepared the site plan
Ex.PW4/1 in the presence of complainant vide recovery
memo Ex.PW4/2, took into possession blood stained
earth and sealed the same into parcel No.1 (Ex.P1). He
also took into possession blood stained garments of

vide recovery memo Ex.PW4/3 and sealed the same into
parcel No.2 (Ex.P2). He prepared the list of legal heirs
of deceased Ex.PW4/4, searched memo vide Ex.PW4/5
in the presence of marginal witnesses and after
completion of investigation he handed over the case file
to the SHO Muhammad Iqbal Khan for submission of

complete challan against the accused. PW-5 Sher
Hassan HC No.1036 is marginal witness to the recovery
memo Ex.PW5/1. PW-6 Arshad Khan Inspector, he
obtained 05 days custody of the accused. PW-7
Muhammad Ishaq Khan Inspector who submitted
complete challan against the accused which is
Ex.PW7/1. PW-8 Jamroz Khan, is marginal witness to
the recovery memo already exhibited as Ex.PW4/1, PH-
9 Haji Muhammad Khan SI, stated that after
completion of investigation he submitted supplementary
challan against the accused which is Ex.PW9/1. PW-10,
Abdul Wali No.519, stated that he was entrusted with
the warrants of arrests under section 204 Cr.PC against
accused Nazim Ali and Azmat Ali. PW-11 Ijaz Nabi SI,
he incorporated the report of the complainant in shape of
murasila Ex.PA/1. He also prepared the inquest report
and injury sheet of the deceased which are Ex.PW11/1
and Ex.PW11/2.

4. After closure of prosecution evidence, accused

was examined under section 342 Cr.PC wherein he
denied the allegations leveled against him and claimed
himself innocent, he neither opted to be examined on

oath nor wished to produce evidence in his defence.
5. Having heard arguments of learned AAG for

the State and record with his valuable assistance gone

through.
6. It was noticed with great concerned that

complainant who is the eye witness of the occurrence
and also victim of attempt at his life still mentioned the
time of occurrence as unknown in the FIR. Similarly no
empties have been recovered from the place of
occurrence despite the fact that complainant alleging that
numerous fire shots being made at them by the accused
party. The complainant deposed in his cross-examination
that;

“I cannot say from which direction we were coming and
to which direction we were proceeding.”

“E do not know at what time my brother Muhammad
Zaman had died.”

It is also astonishing to mention here that the accused
party having deadly weapons and the complainant party
was empty handed, it does not applicable to a prudent
mind that how the complainant escaped unhurt. It is also
worthwhile to mention here that the complainant
narrated in the FIR that he had brought the dead body of
his deceased brother to the DHQ Hospital while as per
statement of doctor on duty, the relative Amjid Ali

brought the dead body to the hospital at 02:00 am which
could suggest that complainant was not present with his
deceased brother. Furthermore, the dead body was
identified by Jamroz Khan and Amjid Ali. There are
glaring contradictions in the statement of the
complainant who has charged the accused/respondent for
the murder of his brother and also eye witness of the
occurrence but he could not plausibly prove his presence
on the spot which makes case of the respondent highly

doubtful.
7. The august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Paio

Khan Vs Sher Baz (2009 SCMR 803) has enunciated a
guiding principle for the appellate Court to consider and
evaluate the evidence of the prosecution on the
touchstone of the said principle in an appeal against
acquittal of an accused under section 417(2) (c) Cr.PC
wherein it is held that:

“It needs no reiteration that when an
accused person is acquitted from the
charge of a Court of competent .
jurisdiction then double presumption of
innocence is attached to its order with
which the superior Courts also not
interfere unless the impugned order is
arbitrary, capricious, fanciful and

against the record.”
When the Courts are satisfied that there seems to a

simple circumstance which creates reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of accused it makes him
entitled to its benefit, not as a matter of grace and
concession, but as a matter of right.

8. It is a settled principle of law that after earning
the acquittal from the trial Court, double presumption of
innocence is acquired by the accused. The Court sitting
in appeal against acquittal always remain slow in
reversing the judgment of acquittal, unless it is found to
be arbitrary, fanciful and capricious on the face of it or is
the result of misreading or non-reading of any material
evidence. In the instant case, no such infirmity worth
consideration has been found in the impugned judgment,
hence warrants no interference. This appeal is devoid of
legal merit which is hereby dismissed in limine.
