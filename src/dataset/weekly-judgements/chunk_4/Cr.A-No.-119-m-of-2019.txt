2: Injured/complainant Bakht Sherwan,
while conducting medical checkup of a child in his
clinic situated at Gogdara on 21.01.2017 at 17:40
hours, was fired at by some unknown accused
through Kalashnikov whereby he sustained injuries
on backside of his left shoulder and left elbow. The
above narrations were made by injured complainant
while reporting the matter to Kifayat Ullah Khan S.]
(PW-4) on the same day at 18:25 hours in casualty
of Central Hospital, Swat. The report was reduced
into Murasila which was verified by his Niaz Ali
(PW-1). He further stated in his report that neither
he nor his family is involved in enmity with anyone.
On the strength of Murasila, formal FIR was
registered initially u/s 324 PPC against some
unknown accused.

3. Police was in search of accused and
came to know through spy information that the
culprit was the present appellant, so, he was arrested
on the same day and the crime weapon Kalashnikov
No.243333 with magazine containing 7.62 bore

were recovered from his possession. The injured
29x

complainant recorded his statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C
wherein he charged the appellant for attempting at
his life. While disclosing the motive, complainant
stated that appellant was ill one year prior to the
occurrence. His brothers had taken him to their
house for inoculating Valium injection to appellant
prescribed by doctor. The appellant had threatened
him for dire consequences in case of passing the
referred injection to him.

4. The injured was examined by Dr. Nasir
Ullah Khan (PW-7) who in his report Ex.PW-7/2
reported one entry wound on left upper arm of about
1 % cm the exit whereof was fond on left shoulder
about 3 cm in size. The second entry wound of 1 cm
in dimension was observed on left elbow of the
injured with exit of 2 cm. In light of the Radiologist
Report, the injury was reported as Ghayr Jaifa
Munagqqilla in light whereof section 337-F(vi) PPC
was added in the FIR.

de After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court and trial of the
appellant was assigned to learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III, Swat. Formal charge was framed

against him to which he did not plead guilty and

SB Hamble Me Justice inten tabi

slic

opted to face the trial. During pendency of the trial,
the issue of mental illness arose before the Court for
which he was examined by Provincial Standing
Medical Board and in view of the report so
furnished, the Court suspended trial of the appellant
vide order dated 13.06.2018 for a period of six
months or his mental recovery, whichever may
earlier. After his specialized treatment in Central
Prison Peshawar, he was shifted back to District Jail
Buner on 28.02.2019. The learned Additional
Sessions Judge-III, Swat, on the request of
prosecution, requisitioned the case file vide order
dated 07.03.2019 for renovating the _ trail
proceedings. In the meanwhile the case was
transferred from the Court of learned ASJ-III to the
Court of learned ASJ-II, Swat vide order dated
25.04.2019 of the learned Sessions Judge, Swat.
Trial against the appellant commenced and _ his
statement was recorded on 25.05.2019 for testing his
mental capacity in light whereof he was found in
good mental health. In the meanwhile the Court of
learned Judicial Magistrate-I, Swat was declared as
MTMC and the case was sent to the said Court vide

order No.2891-99 dated 02.11.2019 issued by

Tapeuayrs*

oi.

learned Sessions Judge, Swat. Prosecution produced
09 PWs in support of its case. On closure of
evidence, the appellant was examined u/s 342,
Cr.P.C. He once again denied the allegations of
prosecution, however, he neither recorded his own
statement on oath nor produced any witness in his
defence. It is noteworthy that complainant had died
a natural death in December, 2019 and the said
factum was confirmed by his son Niaz Ali (PW-1)
and DFC Arif in their statements recorded on
23.12.2019.

6. I have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the parties including the learned A.A.G
and perused the record with their able assistance.

Zz Admittedly, the occurrence has
remained unseen because prosecution has not
examined any eye-witness of the occurrence. Even
the injured complainant himself had not seen the
present appellant at the time of firing nor he has
claimed to have seen him fleeing from the spot after
the occurrence, as such, he did not charge any
accused in the initial report and the FIR was
registered against some unknown assailants. As per

prosecution version, the injured complainant was
TajemayPs?

26%
busy in medical checkup of a child when was
targeted of firing from backside but the I.O has
failed either to examine the child u/s 161, Cr.P.C or
the person who had brought him to get his medical
treatment through the injured, a medical practitioner.
No plausible explanation is available on record for
the said omission on the part of investigating
agency. It can easily be presumed from the said
laxity of the I.O that the child and his attendant, if
any, were not examined for the reason that they
would have disclosed the real facts contrary to the
version of prosecution. In this regard we have
Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984

which reads.

129. Court may presume existence of certain
facts. The Court may presume the existence of
any fact, which it thinks likely to have happened,
regard being had to the common course of
natural events, human conduct and public and
private business, in their relation to the facts of
the particular case.

Withholding of important evidence, as
in the present case, has been mentioned in

illustration (g) to Article 129 ibid which reads.

(g) that evidence which could be and is not
produced would, if produced, be unfavorable to
the person who withholds it;
Tajamul/Ps*

While confronting similar situation in

the case of Muhammad Asif Vs. The State (2017
SCMR 486), the august Supreme Court observed

that:

In our considered opinion these two
independent witnesses could provide the first
degree of evidence of reliable nature, thus,
adverse inference has been drawn that
because they were not supporting the
prosecution case so set up, therefore, they
were dropped at the trial. In this way, the best
evidence, independent in nature, was withheld
from the court for obvious reasons. This fact
by itself is sufficient to discard the evidence of
the interested and related witnesses because
their evidence is not only of the second degree
but also for the reason given above due to
their unnatural conduct.

8. The injured complainant has died a
natural death, therefore, he could not be examined by
prosecution during the trial proceedings. So far the
evidentiary value of FIR lodged by complainant is
concerned, the status of FIR lodged at instance of a
person who died afterwards a natural death is that of
his statement u/s 161, Cr.P.C and nothing more. It is
settled law that statement of complainant cannot be
relied upon unless cross-examined except when the
said statement is recorded as dying declaration. In
this regard I would refer the judgment of the august
Supreme Court in the case of ‘Ghaus Muhammad

alias _Ghausa_and_another Vs. The State’ (1979

Gis
SCMR_579). The rule laid down in the said
judgment is as under:

The maker of the F. I. R. has died. It cannot
be used as corroboration of the testimony of
another person, namely Nur Muhammad P.
W. At best the prosecution can use it for
showing that the name of Nur Muhammad is
mentioned in the F. I. R. but that by itself
would not advance the prosecution case.

9. The learned trial Court, while
convicting the appellant, has mainly relied upon
statement of injured recorded u/s 164, Cr.P.C in
support whereof prosecution has examined
Muhammad Fayaz, the concerned Judicial
Magistrate, as PW-5. Whether statement of a witness
u/s 164, Cr.P.C can base conviction of an accused or
not, this question needs cautious consideration of
this Court. Before making further discussion on
transposition of statement of a dead witness during
the trial of accused, I deem it appropriate to first
discuss background of the statement recorded in the
present case by injured complainant u/s 164, Cr.P.C.
The first question which pricks my mind with regard
to genuineness of the said statement in the present
case is its belated recording after five days of the
occurrence. According to record, the occurrence took
place on 21.01.2017 and police arrested the appellant

on the same day on the basis of information received

a0,
through a secret source regarding his involvement in
the occurrence. It appears that the injured himself
was not sure in respect of the culpability of the
present appellant for his attempted murder otherwise
he would have charged him in the initial report or at
least soon after his arrest. Thus, belated nomination
of the appellant in the case suggests consultation and
deliberation inter se the local police and
complainant.

10. Statement of a witness under Section
164, Cr.P.C can be transferred under the provisions

of Section 265-J, Cr.P.C, which reads.-

“265-J. Statement under section 164 admissible.
The statement of a witness duly recorded under
section 164, Cr.P.C if it was made in the
presence of the accused and if he had notice of it
and was given an opportunity of cross-examining
the witness, may, in the discretion of the Court, if
such witness is produced and examined, be
treated as evidence in the case for all purposes
subject to the provision of the Evidence Act,
1872 (II of 1872)”.

No doubt, the Court is competent to
transfer statement of a witness u/s 164, Cr.P.C into
trial of accused in exercise of its powers u/s 265-J,
Cr.P.C but subject to certain limitations i.e the
accused must be present at the time of recording
statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C, he must be given a notice
of such statement and thereafter he should be

afforded opportunity to cross examine the witness.

Sh Henble Mr fuatie ahtien Iran
= [=

The above conditions, as are manifest from bare
reading of Section 265-J, Cr.P.C, must be fulfilled
before transposition of a statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C of
a witness at trial stage. In the present case, neither
the appellant was present at the time of recording
164, Cr.P.C statement of the injured complainant,
though he had already been arrested on the day of
occurrence, nor he was given notice of the statement
nor any opportunity was afforded to him to cross-
examine the injured complainant. Similarly, proviso
to Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
also lays down the limitation of cross-examination of
a witness by adverse party otherwise his statement
will not be admissible in evidence. Thus, the
statement recorded by injured complainant in the
present case does not fulfill the basic criteria
provided u/s 265-J, Cr.P.C and Article 47 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, hence, the learned
trial Court has illegally based conviction of the
appellant on the statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C recorded

by injured complainant.

il. The legislature in its wisdom has
intentionally used the words “duly recorded” in
Section 265-J, Cr.P.C which have wider

significance. The referred words contemplate that

se Henble:

-ll-
statement of a witness is not “duly recorded” unless
it is read over and explained to the witness in
presence of the accused and will not be admissible
under this Section. Admittedly, the appellant was
neither given a proper notice of the statement
recorded by injured complainant u/s 164, Cr.P.C nor
he was afforded an opportunity of cross examining
the injured through a lawyer of his choice, therefore,
the said statement recorded by complainant cannot
be considered as a substantive piece of evidence.
Reliance in this regard is placed on the judgment in

the case titled “Abdul Hakeem and another Vs. The

State” (PLD 1982 Karachi 975” wherein it was

observed that:

“A reading of this section makes it plain that
the statement should be recorded in the
presence of the accused, the accused should
have notice of the recording of such statement
and he should also be given an opportunity of
cross-examining the witness. On _ the
fulfillment of these conditions, the statement
could be brought on the record within the
discretion of the Court. Such discretion
should be exercised if in the process of
recording such statement sanctity attaches to
it, as normally such statement are recorded
only in cases involving capital sentences. The
mere fact of a Police Officer stating that he
had put the accused on notice would not be
sufficient. Such notice should be in writing
and should also state that he has a right to
cross-examine the witness. Normally in these
circumstances, an accused knowing the peril
in the process would attempt to engage an
advocate and ask for copies of the Police

SB Honble Me Justice ahtieg teas
TojermalPS*

=i[2

statements in advance, so as to effectively

cross examine the witness. Non-compliance

with the spirit underlying section 265-J

exposes the statement to serious criticism.

After all, if an accused is suddenly marched of

the court and asked to cross-examine a

witness, he cannot effectively exercise his right

under the law. It is also a cardinal principle of

law enshrined even in the Constitution that

every person has a right to be defended by an

advocate of his choice. In these circumstances,

if no proper notice is given, failure of justice

might inevitably result and the Court has to

be on caution”.
12. As discussed above, there is no eye-
witness of the occurrence while statement of the
injured complainant u/s 164, Cr.P.C cannot be taken
into account against the appellant in view of the
above discussion, the prosecution is left with only
circumstantial evidence on record. There is no denial
of the fact that injured complainant had sustained
two firearm injuries on his person as per Medico-
legal report Ex.PW-7/1 but the said report is in
conflict with the basic version of prosecution
incorporated in 164, Cr.P.C statement of the injured
complainant. According to medical evidence, the
injured had sustained one entry wound of 1 % cm on
his left upper arm while the second bullet made its

entrance on his left elbow the dimension whereof has

been reported by doctor as 1 cm. Entry wounds of

SS Henble Mi tuatie abting raion
2 [=
different dimensions suggest the use of two different

weapons, hence, it was not the job of one man.

13. Apart from the above-referred conflict
between the version of prosecution and medical
evidence, the place of occurrence is also doubtful
because no blood has been recovered from the place
where the injured has been shown in the site plan.
The injured has sustained the first entry wound on
his left upper arm and there was possibility of
absorption of blood by thick garments commonly
used in winter season but he has sustained the other
wound on his left elbow, hence, the easy flow of
blood from his arm towards the floor could naturally
be expected but non-recovery of any blood from the
spot creates a reasonable doubt in prudent mind that
the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and
manner as narrated by complainant in the FIR as
well as in his statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C. Moreso,
there is visible overwriting in Murasila qua the time
of occurrence and it appears that real facts of the
occurrence have been concealed by investigating
agency. Medical report is also mute about the time of
arrival of the injured to hospital nor the names of
relatives of the injured have been mentioned in the

said report, hence, presence of Niaz Ali (PW-1) with

Se Henle Mt

Tapema/rs*

-14-

his injured father at the time of his medical treatment
is doubtful. Thus, there are major contradictions and
inconsistencies in the case creating serious doubts in
prudent mind regarding the guilt of the appellant qua
attempting at the life of injured complainant and the
benefit thereof must be extended in his favour as per
well-established principle of criminal justice.
Reliance is placed on ‘The State Vs. Ahmed Umar
Shikh and others’ (2021 SCMR 873). The Honb’le

apex Court observed in the said judgment that:

Even if a single circumstance create
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind regarding
guilt of an accused then the accused shall be
entitled to such benefit not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right
and such benefit must be extended to the
accused person(s) by the Courts without any
reservation.
14. As regards the motive part of this case,
complainant at the time of lodging the report
narrated before police that neither he nor his family
had any enmity with anyone but in his statement u/s
164, Cr.P.C he set up a motive behind the occurrence
by stating that one year back brothers of the
appellant had took him for passing Valium injection
to him as advised by doctor and the appellant had
threatened him for life in case of inoculating the

injection to him. The aforesaid motive mentioned by

complainant in his statement not only appears to be

SB Monbie Mr, uatice Inhtiagtpeahion
TojrmalPs*

a [5
after thought for having been introduced at a belated
stage but the same also does not stand to reason. Had
the appellant the intention to satisfy his vengeance
because of the referred motive, he would have done
so soon after the injured had injected him the
intoxicating dose. Taking action of the appellant
against him after one year of the said event does not
stand to reason. Even otherwise, motive is a double-
edged weapon which cuts both sides, as such, false
implication of the appellant by complainant because
of the motive so set up cannot be ruled out. Reliance

is placed on ‘The State VS. Muhammad Sharif and
others’ (1995 SCMR 635) wherein it was held that:

So far as enmity is concerned, it is a

double-edged weapon and cuts both ways. If it

is considered as sufficient motive for

commission of offence, it can also be

considered as sufficient for false implication

as well.
15. Adverting to the recovery of
Kalashnikov No. 243333 from possession of the
appellant used for commission of the offence as per
prosecution version. The weapon has been recovered
from the appellant at the time of his arrest in
presence of witnesses. Statement of the I.O (PW-8)
in this regard has not been shattered by defence

during cross-examination. The recovery of

Kalashnikov from possession of the appellant gets

8 Menble Mr isstic iabtiag Ibrahim
Tajarmalrse

= [Gx
further support from the statement of Muhammad
Ali Shah (PW-3), brother of the appellant.
According to his statement, the weapon was his
ownership and in respect whereof he exhibited copy
of Permit No. 11784 dated 18.09.2008 issued by
DCO Swat as Ex.PW-3/1. Moreso, as per FSL report
Ex.PW-8/14, the recovered Kalashnikov has
matched with 05 empties recovered from the spot.
Thus, prosecution has duly established the guilt of
appellant only to the extent of section 15 of the KP
Arms Act, 2013 and findings of the learned trial
Court in this respect do not call for any interference.
However, the question here is that what will be the
effect of conviction of appellant u/s 15 A.A on the
remaining allegations leveled against him by
prosecution with regard to section 324 & 337-F(vi)
PPC? Recovery of crime weapon is only a
corroborative piece of evidence and it is settled law
that in absence of direct evidence, conviction of an
accused cannot be based only on corroborative
evidence. Reliance in this regard placed on

‘Muhammad Afzal alias Abdullah and others Vs. The
State’ (2009 SCMR 436) wherein it was held that:

After taking out from consideration the ocular
evidence, the evidence of identification and
the medical evidence, we are left with the
evidence of recoveries only, which being

St Henbie Me tuatce nhtiag Ibeahine
wi] «
purely corroboratory in nature, in our view,
alone is not capable to bring home charge
against the appellant in the absence of any
direct evidence because it is well-settled that
unless direct or substantive evidence is
available conviction cannot be recorded on the

basis of any other type of evidence howsoever,
convincing it may be.

Further reliance in this regard is placed
on ‘Zeshan Ali alias Shani and another Vs. The State

and another’ reported as 2013 SCMR 1602.

16. In light of what has been discussed
above, there is no reason before this Court to
interfere with the findings of the learned trial Court
with regard to conviction and sentence of the
appellant u/s 15 A.A, however, his conviction and
sentences u/s 324 & 337-F(vi) PPC need reversal in
view of the reasons discussed in the preceding paras.
Resultantly, this appeal is partially allowed, the
impugned judgment dated 19.03.2021 rendered by
learned trial Court is set aside to the extent of
conviction and sentences of appellant Mir Ali Shah
son of Shehzad Gul u/s 324 & 337-F(vi) PPC, hence,
he is acquitted of the charge under the mentioned
penal sections. His conviction and sentence u/s 15
A.A recorded by learned trial Court are maintained

with benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C.
