2. The case was registered vide FIR No.2525
dated 13.12.2006 under sections 324/34 PPC in Police
Station Mingora, Swat, on the report of Muhammad Ali,
complainant, who reported to Zar Bakht Khan,
ASl/Investigation Officer, after he reached the casualty

ward of Saidu Sharif Hospital and drafted murasila on
the report of the complainant to the effect that on the
eventful day, the complainant went to Continental
Plaza for depositing bill in the ufone office situated in
the Plaza, accompanied by his cousins Farhad Ali and
Gohar Ali sons of Ibrahim, Hamayun son of Bakht
Zamin and his brothers namely Rehmat Ali, Anwar Ali
and Suliman sons of Rahamdil, and were present in
the market after depositing the bill, when Chowkidar of
the Plaza namely Javed son of Karam Ali started
staring at him, and when he asked him for the reason,
the Chowkidar used harsh language and _ started
grappling with him. In the meantime, the appellant, his
son Rahat Ali and Jamshed, residents of Makanbagh,
came there duly armed and opened fire at them with
the intention to commit their Qat/-i-amd, resulting in
firearm injuries to Farhad Ali with the firing of the
appellant, firing of Jamshed causing injuries to
Hamayun and Rahat Ali causing firearm injuries to
Gohar Ali with his firing. The motive for the occurrence
was the aforesaid altercation; and the occurrence was
mentioned to have been witnessed by the other

companions of the complainant. All the three accused
named in the FIR were charged for attempting at the

lives of the complainant and his companions.

3. After registration of the case, all the three

injured-victims were medically examined, and the
Medical Officer found firearm injuries on all the three
injured sustained by them on lower part of their body
i.e. foot, knee and thigh, and simple injuries on Gohar
Ali and Farhad, while grievous injury only on Hamayun.
The medical report of Javed Iqbal, Chowkidar of the
Plaza, conducted on the following day of the
occurrence i.e. 14.12.2006, revealed that two
lacerations on the body of the said injured, with no
fracture, were caused by blunt means. During
investigation, the 1.0 inspected the spot, and
recovered O06 empty shells of 30 bore there-from,
besides securing blood from the place assigned to
injured Gohar Ali in the site plan. The |.0 also received
blood stained garments of the injured-victims, which,
alongwith blood secured from the spot, were sent to
the FSL, and report of the chemical examiner of FSL
from was received in the affirmative. One of the

accused namely Jamshed was arrested on the day of
occurrence i.e.13.12.2006; and after completion of
investigation, complete challan was submitted against
him and Javed Iqbal, besides submissions of challan
under section 512 Cr.P.C against the absconding co-
accused i.e. the convict-appellant and co-accused
Rahat Ali, after they were proceeded against under
sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. The arrested accused,
Jamshed and Javed Iqbal, were formally charged
under section 324/34 PPC and 337-F(ii) read with
section 34 PPC on two counts, to which they pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial, during which, as many as
12 PWs were examined, including the complainant
(PW-2), eyewitnesses namely Farhad Ali (PW-3),
Gohar Ali (PW-4) and Rehmat Ali (PW-5), and Suliman
(PW-6); Scribe of the murasila and |.O in the case Zar
Bakht ASI (PW-8); Medical Officer, Doctor Nadar Khan
(PW-9), and another Medical Officer namely
Saeedullah Khan (PW-11). After prosecution closed its
evidence, statement of both the accused were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, and after hearing
both the sides, the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-Vl, Swat, rendered

judgment dated 30.04.2010, whereby both the accused
facing trial, namely, Jamshed and Javed Iqbal were
acquitted while extending them the benefit of doubt;
and the appellant as well as the co-accused and his
son Rahat Ali were declared proclaimed offenders vide

the same impugned judgment/order dated 30.04.2010.

4. Rahat Ali, co-accused, was later on arrested

in the instant case on 16.09.2011, and after facing trial,
during which the same material witnesses, earlier
examined in the trial against co-accused Jamshed and
Javed Iqbal i.e. complainant (PW-1), eyewitnesses
namely Farhad Ali (PW-2) and Gohar Ali (PW-3),
besides other official witnesses, were again examined,
while private PWs namely Hamayun, Suliman and
Rehmat Ali were abandoned by the prosecution, being
unnecessary; and deceased Zar Bakht Khan S.I was
also abandoned being dead. However, on conclusion
of trial, co-accused Rahat Ali was also acquitted of the
charges vide judgment/order of the learned trial
Court/Additional Sessions Judge-lll/Izafi Zilla Qazi
dated 30.01.2013; and appeal against the order of

acquittal of the co-accused, Rahat Ali, dated
30.01.2013, was dismissed in /imine by this Court vide

judgment/order dated 23.10.2013.

5. In the above background, culminating in the
acquittal of two co-accused, the only remaining
absconding accused i.e. the appellant was formally
arrested on 20.02.2013, after he secured ad-interim
pre-arrest bail from the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi, Swat. The appellant
faced trial after being formally charged, during which
the same PWs i.e. complainant, eyewitness, Gohar Ali
(PW-3) and Farhad Ali (PW-4) were examined,
besides other formal official PWs, and on conclusion of
trial, the appellant was convicted and sentenced, as
mentioned hereinabove; hence this appeal against

conviction and sentences awarded to the appellant.

6. Arguments of learned counsel for the convict-
appellant, AAG for the State assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant heard; and _ record

perused.
7. The complainant, Muhammad Ali, had
charged three persons of the same family, father
Jamshed, son Hazrat Ali and grandson Rahat Ali for
attempting at his life and also at the lives of his
companions, while assigning roles of effective firing on
Farhad Ali to Hazrat Ali, firing on Hamayun to Jamshed
and causing serious firearm injuries on Gohar Ali to
Rahat Ali. The complainant did not impute motive for
the occurrence to the said three accused named in the
FIR, rather motive was ascribed to altercation and
grappling between the complainant and Chowkidar of
the Continental Plaza namely Javed Iqbal son of
Karam Ali after they had a quarrel over staring at the
complainant by the said Chowkidar of Continental
Plaza where the occurrence took place at 18:30 hours
while report was lodged in the casualty of Saidu Sharif
Hospital at 18:55 hours. The accused were shown
armed with firearms, without specifying nature of
weapons of offence; but during trial there were
improvements as well as contradictions in this regard
as some of the witnesses showed the accused armed
with pistols and others deposed to the effect that the

accused were armed with both pistols and
Kalashnikovs. It is, indeed, noteworthy that the
complainant, to whom motive is also attributed,
escaped unhurt, while his companions received
firearms injuries on non vital parts of their bodies like
knee, foot or thigh, which were described as ‘simple’ in
cases of injured Gohar Ali and Farhad and ‘grievous’
only that of injured Hamayun. The nature of injuries
received by the injured coupled with occurrence as
result of quarrel taking place at the spur of moment
would raise question about attempt at the lives of the

complainant and his companions under section 324

PPC.

8. It is a matter of common knowledge that there

is complete darkness at 06:30 PM in the month of
December, but not only source of light was not
mentioned either in the FIR or in the site plan; but
belatedly on 28.12.2006 three bulbs were taken into
possession by the |.O from the Plaza, although version
of the prosecution was to the effect that light of the day
was still there and darkness had not yet spread. This
aspect of the case assumes importance in view of fact

that the accused were not known to the complainant
and the PWs prior to the occurrence and they had
emerged on the scene after alteration and grappling
between the complainant and Chowkidar of the Plaza
and each of the accused was specifically charged for
effective firing on a particular injured PW. It is also
noteworthy that inspite of admission on the part of the
PWs about presence of bullet marks inside the Plaza,
no such bullet marks were noticed by the I.0 during
spot inspection. Moreover, the Continental Plaza is
admittedly a crowded place, and almost all the shops
in the Plaza, with exception of few, were open at the
time of occurrence; but, astonishingly, neither any
other person received even a scratch during alleged
firing by the three accused, nor anyone from the
general public or shops keepers came forward to

deposed about the occurrence.

9. The ‘Chowkidar’ of the Continental Plaza was

admittedly present there at the time of occurrence, and
received two lacerated wounds through blunt means,
and was also made an accused in the case, and faced
trial alongwith accused Jamshed and was

simultaneously acquitted alongwith the said accused
Jamshed; but he had furnished a different version

regarding the occurrence.

10. Above all, the acquittal of co-accused

Jamshed and later that of Rahat Ali, and also dismissal
of appeal of the complainant against acquittal of
accused Rahat Ali would further render evidence of
prosecution against the appellant not worthy of
reliance, for the simple reason that the said two co-
accused were also charged for effective firing and
attempt at the lives of complainant and_ his
companions, and their acquittal was also based on
discrepancies and infirmities in the same evidence of
the prosecution also produced in the case against the
appellant. Needless to say that improvement, if any,
made in the statements of the PWs during trial of the
appellant would be further fatal to the case of the

prosecution against the appellant.

11. In the absence of confessional statement of
the appellant and non recovery of anything
incriminating from him, after his arrest; would make
case against him not distinguishable from the already

acquitted co-accused. The abscondance of the
appellant, per se, in the absence of corroborative
evidence, would not make other evidence against him
worthy of reliance and confidence inspiring to lead to

his conviction.

12. Consequently, the appeal is accepted; and
while setting aside the impugned judgment/order of the
learned trial Court/Additional Sessions Judge/lIzafi Zilla
Qazi, Swat, dated 25.11.2014, together with conviction
of the appellant and sentences awarded to him, vide
the impugned judgment, the appellant is acquitted of
the charges levelled against him; and be set at liberty,

forthwith, if not required in any other case.
