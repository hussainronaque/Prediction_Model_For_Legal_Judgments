JUDGMENT

Dr. Khurshid Iqbal, J.-

1. This appeal is directed against the
judgment dated 15.02.2016 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court, Swat, whereby he
has acquitted the respondent/accused Sanobar s/o
Talizar r/o Wach Khwar, Khwazakhela, Swat. The
respondent/accused was tried under section 9 (b) of the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, having been
charged vide FIR No. 203 dated 13.03.2014 registered
at Police Station Khurshid Khan Shaheed, District

Swat.

2. Necessary but relevant facts of the case

are that on 13.03.2014, at 11:00 hours, the police

personnel of Police Station Khurshid Khan Shaheed,

Abdul Sebooh!* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

2
got information that the respondent/accused, in his

shop situated in Sheen Bazar, was selling and
purchasing Chars. The police contingent, led by ASI
Umar Rahim, rushed to the spot, where the
respondent/accused was found outside of his shop. The
respondent/accused was bodily searched, which led to
the recovery of a plastic bag having Chars, in his
trouser fold. The Chars was weighed. It was found to
be 525 grams. The seizing officer (PW-3) separated 05
grams Chars for chemical examination, sealed it in
parcel No. 1 and the remaining in parcel No. 2. He
prepared a memo of the recovery, drafted the Murasila
and arrested the respondent/accused. He forwarded the
accused, case property and the Murasila to the Police
Station through Constable Abdul Wahid No. 2753, for

registration and investigation of the case.

3. ClO, Muhammad Ayaz, conducted
investigation of the case. During investigation, the
Investigating Officer took into possession a mobile
phone of the respondent/accused vide recovery memo
Ex PW 7/2. He prepared a memo Ex PW 7/5 of
pointation by the respondent/accused, recorded
statements of the witnesses and also took photographs,
Ex PW 7/6. He produced the respondent/accused for

recording his confessional statement. On refusal, the

Absul Sabook!* (0.8) [ON UsTICl [M. 13
JON" STICE Dy. KHURSHID.
3
respondent/accused was sent to judicial lock-up. He

received the FSL report, Ex PW 7/8 and placed the

same on the case file.

4. On completion of the investigation, final
report (challan) was submitted before the learned trial
Court. Copies were supplied to the respondent/ accused
in compliance with Section 265 (c) Cr. PC. Charge was
farmed against him, to which he pleaded not guilty and

claimed trial.

5. The prosecution examined as many as 09
PWs. Thereafter, statement of the respondent/accused
u/s 342 Cr. PC was also recorded, in which he was
afforded an opportunity of evidence in defence and/or

statement on oath but he did not avail it.

6 After hearing arguments of the learned
P.P and counsel for the respondent/accused, the

learned trial Judge acquitted the respondent/accused

through his impugned judgment dated 15.02.2016.

7. Key grounds of appeal are that the
respondent/accused was directly charged in the FIR,
the case was promptly registered, the contraband Chars
was recovered from his personal possession and the

__ FSL report was returned as positive.

8. The learned A.A.G argued that the learned

trial Judge has not properly appreciated the above-
referred significant aspects of the case, which as per

his contention, the prosecution has proved.

9. Learned counsel for the respondent/
accused, on the other hand, argued that there are
material contradictions in the evidence of the
prosecution regarding the allegations of selling and
purchasing of the contraband Chars, the recovery and
safe custody as well as safe transmission of the case
property to the FSL, which has rightly resulted into

acquittal of the respondent/accused.

10. We have heard arguments of Mr. Haq
Nawaz Asst:A.G, for the State as well as Barrister
Asad-ur-Rahman, learned counsel for the respondent/

accused and perused the material available on record.

1. Constable Sardaraz Khan No. 266 (PW-
2), a marginal witness of the recovery memo, negated
the recovery on the spot as he deposed that the
contraband Chars was weighed by the complainant/
seizing officer in the vehicle. Needless to say, the
contraband Chars was to be weighed on the spot. The
next material doubt reflected in the statement of PW-2

is that the contraband Chars was found in the shape of

Ark Sabeck™ (DB) HON'SLE MR, IUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HONBLE MR. JUSTICE Or, KHUBSHID LOBAL,
5
packets (LL5se3), whereas in the recovery memo (Ex

PW 2/1) and, as per the deposition of the complainant/
seizing officer, the same was not shown to be in
packets (UL5se). When asked about the separation of
samples from the so-called pieces, he expressed his
lack of knowledge. Yet another anomaly apparent from
his deposition is that he failed to disclose as to whether
and which seal was affixed by the complainant/seizing
officer on the parcels of the case property. The other
marginal witness of the recovery memo was Constable
Abdul Wahid No. 2753, who was examined as PW-9.
His cross-examination reveals that the contraband
Chars was in the form of a slab and that only sample
was separated from it. His cross-examination further
reveals that no seal was put on the parcel. It further
divulges that the respondent/accused on seeing the
police party, entered the shop of a barber, from where

he was arrested.

12. The complainant/seizing officer was

examined as PW-3. While under cross-examination, he

admitted that:

i. He conducted no test purchase in respect
of the allegations regarding selling and
purchasing of the contraband Chars.

ii. The respondent/accused saw the police
party but he did not try to run away from
the spot.

Abdul Sabook!* (0.8) HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

iii, He did not count the number of pieces of
Chars while he was weighing it. This
indicates that even he himself blew off
his contention that the contraband Chars
was in one single block.

iv. He separated samples from only one
piece.

v. He has no monogram of his name and
that he had used the monogram of SHO
Ghani Rahman, the initial of which is
GR.

13. PW-4 is the statement of ASI Abdul Wali
Khan, who received the Murasila from Constable
Abdul Wahid No. 2753, which he incorporated into
FIR. PW-S is the testimony of Constable Said Rahman
No. 2111, Muharir in the Police Post Fateh Pur. He
deposed in his examination-in-chief only this much
that he handed over the samples of 05 grams Chars to
Constable Yaseen No. 631 (PW-6) on 13.03.2014, for

transmitting it to the FSL.

14, From the deposition of these two PWs, it
is not clear that Constable Abdul Wahid handed over
the case property comprising of parcels, both of the
samples and the remaining, to the Muharir in the Police
Station. It is also not stated at all as to whom the case
property was handed over in the Police Station. It
appears that the case property would have been given
to Constable Said Rahman No. 2111 (PW-5) Muharir

of the Police Station, but he did not state it at all. PW-5

Abdul Sabook!* (0.B) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
JON’ BLI justic: il

was supposed to have kept the case property in safe

custody, entered it in register No. 19 and then handed it
over to the Investigating Officer, who was further
supposed to have handed it over to Constable Said
Rahman and Yaseen Ullah for transmitting it to the
FSL. Constable Said Rahman has even deposed that he
handed over the samples to Constable Yaseen Ullah on
13.03.2014. When Yaseen Ullah entered the witness
box as PW-6, he deposed that he took the samples to

the FSL on 14.03.2014, the next day.

15. Muhammad Ayaz, the Investigating
Officer, was examined as PW-7. A critical reading of
his deposition would show that he recovered the cell
phone of the respondent/accused vide a memo,
obtained his police custody for investigation and took
the respondent/ accused to the place of occurrence for
pointation. In his examination-in-chief, he has kept
mum on material aspects of the case, such as whether
and when he received the case property, whether and
how he managed the safe custody of the contraband
Chars in the Police Station and its safe transmission to
the FSL. While under cross-examination, he admitted
that the place of occurrence (Sheen Bazar) is a busy
place, where private persons could have been

examined in support of the occurrence. He was asked a

“Abdul Sabook!* (0.8) HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Br, KHURSHID IOBAL

8
specific question in this regard, to which he replied that

he did his best but no one was ready to come forward.
In reply to another question, he stated that though he
had the power to initiate legal action against any
member of the public, who refused to be a witness of

the proceedings but he initiated no such legal action.

16. Under section 25 of the CNSA, 1997,
compliance of section 103 Cr.P.C is not mandatory.
While there are rulings of the hon’ble superior Courts
both for and against the application of section 103
Cr.P.C, the thrust of the judicial opinion is that
regardless of the requirements of section 103 Cr.P.C,
the police officials shall, where the recovery has been
effected in a public place, associate private persons
with the recovery proceedings. The hon’ble superior
Courts held that this is necessary in order to lend
credibility and ensure transparency in the legal
processes. It has also been held that association of
private witness to the recovery will also ensure what is
known as the rule of caution. Certain cases may be
referred here. In Hakim Ali v. The State (2001
P_Cr.L.J_1865) [Karachi], conviction and sentence

was set aside for the reason that no independent
witness was examined in the case despite the fact that

the occurrence took place during the day time. In a

Abéei Sebook?* .B) HON BLE MR. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON’BLE MR. [USTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

9
2013 case, while acquitting the accused, the hon’ble

Court, among others, observed that non association of
private witnesses to the recovery proceedings, despite
the fact that a large number of people were present at

the crime scene, the prosecution story appeared to be

unnatural, Ghulam Mustafa alias Mushtaq Ali vy.
The State (2013 P Cr. L.J 860) [Sindh]. A similar

opinion was expressed by this Court in a case titled as
Imran v. The State reported as 2013 P Cr. LJ 640.
Regarding the non production of the copies of daily

diary, it was held in Ghulam Mustafa’s supra and

Wahab Ali and another v. The State (210 P Cr. LJ
157) [Federal Shariat Court], that such a defect

would create a material doubt, the benefit of which
must go to the accused. It is in such circumstances of
the case in hand, mere positive result regarding chars,
furnished by the FSL, is not sufficient to be taken as
ground for conviction. It is quite clear that the best
available evidence was excluded by the prosecution.
The established principle is that the prosecution is
bound to prove his case beyond any reasonable shadow

of doubt.

17. Constable Hazrat Ali No. 674, was
produced as PW-8, who furnished evidence of the fact

that the respondent/accused made pointation of the

Abtut Saboon!* (0.8) HON'BLE ME. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr, KHURSHID IOBAL
10
place of occurrence to the CIO, regarding which a

memo was also prepared in his presence.

18, The conclusion of the above discussion is
that substantial dents are floating in the evidence of the
prosecution. To sum up, the exact shape of the
contraband Chars was not proved. The PWs materially
differed on whether the contraband Chars was in one
block/slab or in different pieces. They also remained
inconsistent regarding the separation of samples from
one block/slab and/or different pieces. The safe
shifting of the contraband Chars, its receipt and safe
custody in the Police Station is materially doubtful.
The prosecution case is deficient inasmuch as the case
property was not entered in register No. 19. It is
abundantly clear that one of the PWs, namely Yaseen
Ullah, received the samples on 13.03.2014, but he took
it to the FSL on 14.03.2014, with no explanation at all.
Though, the complainant/seizing officer stated that
while leaving the Police Station for the place of the
occurrence, entry was made in the daily diary, but the
Investigating Officer did not place it on the record. Yet
another substantial doubt in the prosecution case is that
the complainant/seizing officer did not put the
monogram of his name on the parcels rather, the worst

is that he put the monogram of another police officer,

Abstul Sabook{* (0.B) ION" A EI
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID IOBAL

11
who was not present with the police party at the time

of recovery. For the sake of guidance, reference may
be made to the case law on the subject. In the case of
Akhtar Iqbal vs. The State reported as 2015 SCMR

291, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that:

“The learned counsel for the appellant has
taken us through the statement made by the
sole surviving attesting witness of the
Memorandum of Recovery namely Mati-ur-
Rehman (P.W.2) and has pointed out a
number of factors available in his statement
which had created some doubts in the alleged
recovery effected from the appellant but the
most important factor in that connection,
which compounded all those doubts and
raised a big question mark upon the veracity
of the prosecution's case against the appellant,
was that after allegedly recovering the
contraband substance from the boot of the
motorcar driven by the appellant the parcels
of the recovered substance were sealed with a
monogram reading as SJ and it had been
disclosed by Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2) before
the learned trial Court that the said
monogram belonged to one Sameen Jan

Inspector who was not even posted at the
relevant Police Station at the time of the

alleged recovery from the appellant and as a
matter of fact at the said time the said
Inspector was serving at a Police Station in
Quetta. Mati-ur-Rehman (P.W.2) had not
been able to advance any _ explanation
whatsoever as to why the recovery officer
namely Assistant Director Rehmat had not
put his own monogram on the seals of the
parcels prepared by him and as to why he had
used the monogram of some other officer who

was not even posted at the relevant Police
Station at the relevant time. As if this were not

enough, a question had arisen before the
learned trial Court as to whether samples had
indeed_been_secured from each and every
separate packet_of the narcotic substances
allegedly recovered in this case or not and in
that regard the learned trial court had
ordered desealing of two parcels of the
recovered substances and the note recorded
by the learned trial Court in that regard tends
to create an impression as if the claim of the

“Abtul Saboosl (D6) I . JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEE
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHIO IQBAL

Ez

12

prosecution that a sample had been taken
from each and every slab of the recovered

substances might not be correct.”

Similarly, this Court in the case of Usman

Shah vs. The State reported as 2022 YLR_ 82],

observed as under:

“The seizing officer while appearing before
the Court as PW-2, deposed in his Court's
statement that after recovery of contraband,
he separated samples for FSL purpose and
sealed in parcels Nos.1 to 8 and remaining
stuff in parcel No.9 with a monogram of
"MK" which, he categorically admitted that
same is not pertained to his name and in fact
the same stands for Mukhtiar Khan, S.L.,
who was stated to be present with the
complainant. The alleged recovery seems to
be doubtful, rather hints at something to be
planted by complainant, because said
Mukhtiar Khan SI was never cited as a
witness during proceedings in the instant
case.”

Yet, in another case titled Ayaz alias
Imran vs. The State reported as 2021 YLR 16/3, it

was held:

“Regarding monogram, he stated that; "My
personal monogram has an inscription of
MK. It is correct that my name is Iftikhar
Ahmad. It is incorrect to suggest that MK is
not my monogram." On the other hand,
PW.3 Madad Khan, Inspector/CIO who
conducted investigation in the instant case
categorically admitted that MK monogram
is the abbreviation of his name, which is
lying in the PP. He further admitted that;
"The MK monogram lying in the PS
normally and whenever requires by any
office the same requisition from the PS;
however, at the relevant time it was present
in the PP." He further stated that;. "MK
monogram available in case of need in the
PS and PP and also after need remain in my
custody." No doubt, the said monogram

JURSHID EY

‘Abdel Sebook!* (0.8) HON'BLE MA. JUSTICE MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Or, KHURSHID IOBAL
13

does not signify the name of the seizing
officer PW-1 namely Iftikhar Ahmad ASI
and; no explanation was offered as to why
the said parcels did not contain the
monogram of seizing officer, as such, has
created a serious doubt regarding the seizer
of contraband.”

19. An accused person, as a matter of right, is
presumed to be innocent before trial unless the charge
is proved against him/her. Acquittal at the trial gives
rise to double presumption of innocence for an
accused. An appellate Court needs to be cautious while
considering the evidence and should avoid reversal of
an acquittal, unless it finds that the acquittal is
perverse, conjectural, arbitrary, jurisdictionally
defective and prompted by mis-reading or non-reading
of evidence. Even if a contrary view is formed on
re-appraisal of evidence, it should not be used to
disturb an acquittal, provided convincing evidence is
available on the record to reverse acquittal. In this
respect, reference may be made to the judgment of the
Hon’ble Apex Court rendered in the case of Jehangir
ys. Aminullah & others reported as 2010 SCMR 491,

where it was held:

“It is well-settled by now that there are
certain limitations on the power of the
Appellate Court to convert acquittal into a
conviction. It is well-settled that Appellate
Court would not interfere with acquittal
merely because on reappraisal of the
evidence it comes to the conclusion
different from that of the Court acquitting

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE Dr. KHURSHID JOBAL

14

the accused, provided both the conclusions
are reasonably possible. If, however, the
conclusion reached by that Court was such
that no reasonable person would
conceivably reach the same and was
impossible then this Court would interfere
in exceptional cases on overwhelming
proof resulting in conclusive and
irresistible conclusion; and that too with a
view only to avoid grave miscarriage of
justice and for no other purpose. The
important test visualized in these cases, in
this behalf was that the finding sought to
be interfered with, after scrutiny under the
forgoing searching light, should be found
wholly as artificial, shocking and
ridiculous. The view taken by this Court in
Ghulam Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan PLD
1985 SC 11 is well-known that "in an
appeal against acquittal this Court would
not, on principle, ordinarily interfere and
instead would give due weight and
consideration to the findings of Court
acquitting the accused. This approach is
slightly different from that in an appeal
against conviction when leave is granted
only for the re-appraisement of evidence
which then is undertaken so as to see that
benefit of every reasonable doubt should
be extended to the accused. This difference
of approach is mainly conditioned by the
fact that the acquittal carries with it the
two well-accepted presumptions: one
initial, that, till found guilty, the accused is
innocent; and two that again after the trial
a Court below confirmed the assumption
of innocence. This will not carry the
second presumption and will also thus lose
the first one if on points having conclusive
effect on the end result the Court below:
(a) disregarded material evidence; (b)
misread such evidence; (c) received such
evidence illegally". This principle was also
followed in Muhammad Iqbal v. Sanaullah
PLD 1997 SC 569, State v. Farman
Hussain PLD 1995 SC' 1, Ghulam
Sikandar v. Mamaraz Khan PLD 1985 SC
11, Ahmad v. Crown PLD 1951 FC 107,
Abdul Majid v. Superintendent of Legal
Affairs, Government of Pakistan PLD 1964
SC 426, State v. Bashir PLD 1997 SC 408,
Muhammad Sharif v. Muhammad Javed
PLD 1976 SC 452, Shahzado v. State PLD
1977 SC 413; Farmanullah v. Qadeem

Hussain v. Manzoor Hussain Shah 2002
SCMR 261.”

20. In view of the above, we have reached to
the conclusion that the learned trial Court has rightly
acquitted the respondent/accused vide the impugned
judgment dated 15.02.2016. We find the instant appeal

devoid of merit. It is, therefore, dismissed.
