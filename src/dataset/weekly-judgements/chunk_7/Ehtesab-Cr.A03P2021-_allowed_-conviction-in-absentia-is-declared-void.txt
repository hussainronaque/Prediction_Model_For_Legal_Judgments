SYED ARSHAD ALI, J:- This consolidated judgment in the
instant Ehtisab Criminal Appeal filed by appellant Ahsan
Ullah Khan under section-32 of the National Accountability
Ordinance, 1999, shall also dispose of the connected Writ
Petition No. 604-P/2021 filed by the petitioner for suspension
of operation of the sentence awarded by the learned Judge,

Accountability Court-IV, Peshawar.

2. Arguments heard and record of the case was
perused.
3. It is the case of prosecution that on receipt of

information regarding illegal promotions of Revenue Staff and
illegal allotment of land by the appellant, while serving as
Senior Member Board of Revenue, an inquiry was conducted
which later converted into investigation and during
inquiry/investigation, the Investigation Officer collected
necessary documentary as well as oral evidence and submitted
his report wherein it was held that accused Ahsan Ullah Khan
during his tenure as Senior Member Board of Revenue

illegally and without jurisdiction promoted revenue officials
2
by misusing his authority under the garb of judicial powers.
That during investigation it was established that hte appellant
has committed the offence of corruption and corrupt practices
as defined in section 9(a) (iv) punishable under Section 10 of
the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 (“NAO, 1999”).
4. On the basis of inquiry, Reference against
accused Ahsan Ullah Khan/appellant was submitted in the
Accountability Court-IV, Peshawar. Accused was summoned
repeatedly through SHO concerned but the summons returned
un-served, on the basis whereof the statement of Zahoor
Ahmad DC was recorded. The statement of the DEFC is
Ex.SW1/2 while the statement and his report are Ex.SW1/1
and Ex.SW1/2. On the basis of statement of the DFC,
proceedings under Section 512 Cr.P.C. was initiated against
the accused-appellant. During proceedings under Section 512
Cr.P.C., statements of some of the PWs were recorded
including the investigation officer. In the light of the evidence
recorded by the prosecution, the accused was declared
proclaimed offender and perpetual warrant of arrest was
issued against him vide order dated 02.01.2017. The accused
was also convicted under Section 31-A of the National
Accountability Ordinance, 1999 and sentenced to undergo
three years imprisonment.
5. Arguments heard and record perused.
6. The essential question before this Court as to

whether the present appellant could be tried and convicted in
3
absentia under Section 31-A of the NAO, 1999. In order to
comprehend the mandate of Section 31-A of the NAO, 1999,
it would be appropriate to reproduce the said provision of

law:-

“31-A_ Absconding to avoid service of warrants.-

(a) Whoever absconds in order to avoid being
served with any process issued by any Court or
any other authority or officer under this
Ordinance or in any manner prevents, avoids or
evades the service on himself of such process or
conceals himself to screen himself form the
proceedings or punishment under _ this
Ordinance shall be guilty of an offence under
this Ordinance punishable with imprisonment
which may extend to three — years
notwithstanding the provisions of sections 87
and 88 of Code , or any other law for the time
being in force.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 18 it
shall not be necessary to file a reference under
this section in cases where a reference is
pending before the Court”.

7. The bare perusal of the provision would show
that a person deliberately avoiding his
appearance/participation in a criminal trial under the NAO,
1999 becomes guilty of an offence distinct from the offences
for which he is tried. We have also perused Sections 16 & 17
of the NAO, 1999 envisaging procedure of the trial, which are

reproduced as under:-

“16. Trial of offences:

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any
other law for the time being in force an accused
shall be prosecuted for an offence under this
Ordinance in the Court and the case shall be
heard from day to day and shall be disposed of
within thirty days.

(b) The Court shall sit at such place or places as
the Federal Government may, by order, specify
in this behalf.

(c) Where more Courts than one have been
established at a place, the Chief Justice of the
High Court of the Province concerned shall
designate a Judge of any such Court to be an
Administrative Judge and a case triable under
4

this Ordinance shall be filed before the Court of
the Administrative Judge who may either try the
case himself or, assign it for trial by any other
Court established at that place at any time prior
to the framing of the charge.

(cc) In respect of a case assigned to a Court
under sub-section (c), all orders made or
proceedings taken before the assignment shall
be deemed to have been made or taken by the
Court to which the case has been assigned.

(d) Notwithstanding any thing contained in this
section, if in respect of any case relating to an
offence triable under this Ordinance, the
Chairman NAB, having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case may file a reference
before any Court established anywhere in
Pakistan, and such Court shall have the
Jurisdiction to try the same.

17. Provisions of the Code to apply:

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any
other law for the time being in force, unless
there is anything inconsistent with the
provisions to this Ordinance, the provisions of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of
1989), shall mutatis mutandis, apply to the
proceedings under this Ordinance.

(b) Subject to sub section (a), the provisions of
Chapter XXIIA of the Code shall apply to trials
under this Ordinance.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-
section (a) or sub-section (b) or in any law for
the time being in force, the Court may, for
reasons to be recorded, dispense with any
provision of the Code and follow such
procedure as it may deem fit in the
circumstances of the case.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in section 234 of the
Code, a person accused of more offences than
one of the same kind committed during ht space
of any number of years, from the first of the last
of such offences, may be charged with and tried
at one trial for any number of such offences”.

8. Nowhere the aforesaid provisions manifest the
intention of the legislature for trial of an accused under
Section 31-A of the NAO, 1999 in absentia. Even otherwise,

after the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of

Muharam _Ali_vs. Federation of Pakistan_ (PLD 1998 SC
1445) and in the case of Manzar Qayyum ys. The State and

others (PLD 2006 SC 343), trial of an accused in absentia
5
unless elaborately provided in a Statute is itself void. In this
regard, we can refer to a judgment of the Hon’ble Karachi
High Court rendered in the case of Noor Muhammad Khatti
vs. The State_ (2005 PCr.LJ 1889) authored by his Lordship
Mr. Justice Rahmat Hussain Jafferi, para-06 of the said

judgment is reproduced as under:-

“We have given due consideration to the arguments,
gone through the material available on the record
and find that the accused were convicted in absentia.
In some of the earlier enactments, the Legislature
have allowed the Courts to try the accused in
absentia after fulfilling certain conditions. The said
provisions are available in Suppression of Terrorist
Activities Act, 1975 and Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
IN both the enactments, a detailed procedure has
been provided for the trial of accused who absconds
because he evaded and avoided the service of
warrants or concealed himself to screen himself from
the proceedings and punishment. The procedure
starts from the issuance of warrants, publication of
proclamation in the newspapers, engaging an
Advocate on State expenses or by the accused,
framing charge, recording evidence allowing the
Advocate to conduct cross-examination to the
witnesses, hearing arguments, — pronouncing
judgment in the absence of the accused, setting aside
judgment if accused appears before the Court after
fulfilling certain conditions.

9. We have also gone through the celebrated
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Dr. Mobashir
Hassan_and_ others vs. Federation of Pakistan_and_ others
(PLD 2010 Supreme Court 265). In the said judgment, the
vires of National Reconciliation Ordinance, 2007 was
challenged. Through the said Ordinance, an amendment was
made in the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 through

Section 31-aa whereby trial in absentia was declared illegal.

Although in Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s case_ the said provision
6

was declared ultra vires but on the principle of trichotomy.
Therefore, the trial and conviction of an accused for an
offence under Section 31-A of NAO, 1999 would though be
illegal, however, the convicted person has to formally
challenge the same before the Appeal Court under Section 32
of the NAO, 1999. In this regard, we would like to reproduce
para-71 & 72 of Dr. Mobashir Hassan’s case_ (PLD 2010
Supreme Court 265), which reads as under:-

“71. On having gone through the above
judgment, it is crystal clear that offence falling
within the mischief of Section 31A of the NAO, 1999
is distinct offence, from the allegations made in the
reference, which was filed against an accused and if
the convict has been acquitted in the reference or
the reference has been withdrawn, even then the
conviction under Section 31A of the NAO, 1999
remain operative and the convict has to avail
remedy, for getting it set aside, by approaching the
next higher judicial forum, as envisaged under
Section 32 of the NAO, 1999.

72. As discussed above, conviction in absentia is
a final order, therefore no other forum can declare
such conviction as void, except a judicial forum,
that too, by filing an appeal. But in instant case, as
it has been pointed out hereinabove, by amending a
law, such conviction has been declared void,
therefore, the amendment in Section 31A of the
NAO, 1999 by inserting clause (aa), by means of
Section 6 of the NRO, 2007, is declared void being
against the provisions of Section 31A read with
Section 32 of the NAO, 1999, which provides
remedy to the convict to file appeal”.

10. In view of the above, we set aside the impugned
judgment dated 02.01.2017 of learned Accountability Court-
IV, Peshawar convicting the appellant under Section 31-A of
NAO, 1999 to suffer three years imprisonment is set aside and
the case is remanded to the learned trial Court to proceed
against the appellant in accordance with law. During the

proceedings, the present appellant shall remain on bail against
7
the existing sureties/bond till the conclusion of the trial unless
he misuses the concession of bail and in that eventuality the
prosecution would be at liberty to approach this Court for
recalling of the bail.
11. This appeal as well as the connected Writ Petition

No. 604-P/2021 are disposed of accordingly.
