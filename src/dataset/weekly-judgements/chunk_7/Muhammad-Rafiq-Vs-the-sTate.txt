JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioners (1) Muhammad Rafiq and (2)

Aqib Abdullah Khan, seek bail in case FiR

No.101/2015 dated 21.05.2015, registered

under Sections 2(S), 32, 79, 121 and 178

Customs Act, 1969 punishable under Clauses

8, 89, 14 and 63 of Section 156 (1) ibid Act

r/w Transshipment Rules, Chapter XIV,

Notified vide SRO 45091)/2001 dated

18.06.2001, in Police Station FIR/AHTC,

Peshawar.

2. Accusations against the petitioners

are that of replacing containerized imported

high-value/high tariff goods with low-value-

tarrif goods, en-routed from Karachi to

Peshawar.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.
4. It appears from the record that both

the petitioners are neither owners of the

containers nor the goods but are drivers.

Being drivers, they on the instructions of

absconding co-accused Imran Customs

Agent took their vehicles/ containers to the

godown where some other unknown

persons/accused by breaking the seals,

unloaded the high tariff goods and loaded

low value good. It is yet to be determined

during trial as to whether the petitioners had

knowledge and intention with the principal

accused Imran about the alleged replacement

of the goods because they are not

beneficiaries and being drivers were bound to

follow the directions. This aspect of the case,

makes their case arguable for the purpose of

bail.

5. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Both the petitioners are admitted to bail

provided each one of them furnishes bail

bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two

sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned Trial Court. The

sureties must be local, reliable and men of

means.
