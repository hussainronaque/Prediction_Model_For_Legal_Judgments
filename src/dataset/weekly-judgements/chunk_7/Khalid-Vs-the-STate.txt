JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Khalid, seeks bail in case FIR No.555

dated 01.07.2015, registered under sections 15

and 17 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act and

section 7 Anti Terrorism Act, at Police Station

Badhaber, Peshawar, wherein he is charged for

having been found in possession of total 12410

live rounds of different bores from secret

cavities of his vehicle bearing registration

No.9917 KR-Sindh on 01.07.2015.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. No doubt, the petitioner has allegedly

been shown arrested red handed alongwith huge

quantity of ammunitions of various bores, but no

material whatsoever has been collected during

investigation to show his nexus with any

terrorist activities or his previous involvement in

cases of terrorism. On query, learned AAG on

behalf of the State, also fairly and frankly

conceded that record is silent qua involvement

of the petitioner in any terrorist activities or that

the recovered ammunitions were _ being

transported by him for the purpose of terrorism.

In the above eventualities, applicability of S.7

ATA, requires further probe and it is a case of

mere possession falls within the ambit of

sections 15 and 17 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Arms Act, 2013, punishments of which do not

fall within the Restrictive limb of $.497 Cr.P.C.

and in such like cases bail is a rule and refusal

thereof an exception. On the face of record, I see

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

no exceptional circumstance to clog the way of

bail to petitioner.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided

he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties each in the like

amount to the satisfaction of learned Trial

Court/Judge Special Court ATC, Peshawar. The

sureties must be local, reliable and men of

means.
