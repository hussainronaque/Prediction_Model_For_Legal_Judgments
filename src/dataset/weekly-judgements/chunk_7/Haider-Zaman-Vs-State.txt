ORDER

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, J:- Petitioner Haider Zaman,
seeks his release on post arrest bail in case FIR No.44
dated 20.01.2015, registered under sections
302/324/114/34 PPC, in Police Station Hoti Mardan, on
two fold grounds i.e. merits and statutory delay in
conclusion of his trial.

2. As per contents of FIR, petitioner along with
co-accused Gohar Ali, Wajid Ali and Tahir, is charged for
committing the murder of Kashif deceased with firearm, an
attempt to commit the murder of complainant Taseer as
well as causing him firearm injuries on 20.01.2015 at 08.30
hours, near Mayar Pull, on a motive of previous blood

feud.
3. Sardar Ali father of complainant Taseer along with
Junior of Mr. Yousaf Shah Mohmand, Advocate, appeared
before the Court, submitted Wakalat nama of his counsel
and requested for adjournment on the ground of non-
availability of his counsel. Since, time was already
provided to the complainant on 04.10.2017 to engage a
counsel, therefore, being a bail matter, cannot be kept
pending for indefinite period on such pretext, hence,
arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner and learned
AAG for the State heard and record perused with their able
assistance.

4. Since, trial of the petitioner and his co-accused is
already in progress so much so that some of the
prosecution evidence has also been recorded, therefore, this
Court will not dilate upon the grounds for bail on merits
agitated by learned counsel for the petitioner during his
arguments lets it may prejudice the case of either side.

5. As regards the plea of bail of the petitioner on
statutory ground, it appears from the record that the
petitioner is behind the bars since 03.08.2015. Challan
against him was submitted before the learned Trial Court
on 17.09.2015, wherein he was charge sheeted on
28.10.2015. In the meantime, co-accused Gohar and Tahir
were arrested and submission of supplementary challans
against them led the learned trial Court to framing of fresh

formal charge on 28.10.2015. Since, 28.10.2015, till date
only four PWs have been examined. The material
prosecution evidence which also includes the testimony of
complainant is yet to be recorded. Various order sheets of
the learned Trial Court reveal that the trial of the petitioner
is being delayed due to non-availability/ non-appearance of
the complainant, who reportedly has proceeded abroad 1.e.
Saudi Arabi in connection with earning his livelihood.
Perusal of the last order sheet of the learned Trial Court
further reveals that that last opportunity was provided to
the prosecution to produce complainant for recording his
evidence but invain. Father of complainant present in the
Court, when asked qua the whereabouts of complainant, he
stated at the bar he is in Saudi Arabia, however, he did not
give any reasonable time about his return to the country.
The petitioner is behind the bars for the last more the two
years awaiting conclusion of his trial. There seems no
possibility rather probability of appearance of the
complainant. Though, in such like circumstances the
petitioner may recourse to the provisions of section 344 or
265-K ete of the Code of Criminal Procedure, before the
learned Trial Court, especially enacted to meet such like
situation, however, at the same time, the 3" proviso to
section 497 Cr.P.C. also gives right to him to ask for his
bail on the ground of delay in conclusion of trial. Speedy
trial is inalienable right of every accused. Unnecessary

delay in trial of an accused would amount to denial of
justice. The Primary object behind the view is that a
mistaken relief of bail can be repaired by convicting the
accused at the end of trial, if proved guilty, but no proper
reparation can be offered to an accused in case of his/her
acquittal in the long run. Right of an accused to be enlarged
on bail under 3™ proviso to section 497 Cr.P.C. is a
statutory right and such right is left to the discretion of the
Court which is to be exercised judiciously. No doubt, such
discretion can be refused to an accused in the
circumstances when the court reaches to the conclusion
that the delay in the conclusion of the trial is occasioned by
the accused or anybody acting on his behalf. However, if
the delay alleged is not occasioned by the accused or any
person acting on his/her behalf then the discretion of bail
should be exercised in favour of the accused.

6. For the reasons discussed above, petitioner has
made out a case of bail under 3“ Proviso to section 497
Cr.P.C., hence, this petition is allowed and he is admitted
to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
rupees three lacs with two local, reliable and resourceful
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Trial Court.
