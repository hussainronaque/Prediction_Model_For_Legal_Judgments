MOHAMMAD _ IBRAHIM _ KHAN, J:-.
After being enmeshed in case FIR No.163
dated 03.03.2022, registered under Sections
489-F/420 PPC, at Police Station MRS,
Kohat, petitioner Farman Hussain is looking
for his post arrest bail.

2. As per contents of FIR registered on
the basis of acceptance of application filed
under Section 22-A Cr.PC, by complainant
Hamid Jamil Khan, Principal Garrison Cadet

College, Kohat, vide order of learned Justice
of Peace/ Addl: Sessions Judge-VII, Kohat,
a Departmental inquiry was conducted
against petitioner, then serving as Director,
Finance, Garrison Cadet College, Kohat, on
account of his involvement in illegal and
immoral activities. At conclusion of inquiry,
petitioner was found guilty of committing
misappropriation, cheating, fraud and
embezzlement in the bank account of
amount of Rs. 37,538,329/-, who was
dismissed from service. On assurance and
commitment of petitioner qua return of said
amount, he handed over different cheques
to the complainant for encashing the same,
out of which first cheque bearing
No.1749529175 of Rs.50,00,000/- dated
30.09.2021, on presentation before Muslim
Commercial Bank, Bannu road, was
dishonored due to insufficient funds. The
complainant approached the local police as
well as the DPO, Kohat for registration of
the case against petitioner but no heed was

paid to him, therefore, he filed application
under Section 22-A Cr.PC before the Justice
of Peace, Kohat; which was allowed vide
order dated 23.02.2022, thereby directing
the SHO concerned to register the FIR
against petitioner. On the basis of which,
present case was registered.

3. I have heard learned counsel for
the parties and gone through the record.

4. Learned counsel for petitioner
besides the quantum of sentence at the most
would extend to three years or with fine or
with both, has relied upon the judgments of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan and
this Court, reported in cases of “Abdul
Saboor Vs The State through A.G. KPK
and_ another” (2022, SCMR_ 592) and
“Muhammad Ishaq Vs The State and

another” (2018 YLR Note 140 Peshawar)

respectively and prayed for grant of bail to
the petitioner.

5. Inversely, learned AAG
appearing on behalf of the State assisted by

learned counsel for complainant, opposed
the bail on the ground of personal assurance
of the petitioner by filing an affidavit before
the competent authority/ complainant, that
as he has committed the offence falling
within the meaning of Section 489-F PPC
(dishonestly issuing a cheque) besides 408
PPC (criminal breach of trust by clerk or
servant), is liable for the return of amount
and has furnished series of cheques.

6. This Court is well aware of
dishonoring of the cheques which even if
become part of prosecution evidence and
bring home the charges would entail
punishment to the maximum 3 years or with
fine or with both but it is also to be taken
into consideration that when there is an
exception for refusal of bail even for the
offence where grant of bail is a rule, bail
may be and can be refused. Moreover, the
apex Court has repeatedly held that the mere
fact that an offence does not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497(1) Cr.PC,

would not mean that such an offence had
become a bailable offence. The discretion
still remains with the competent Court to
consider whether a person accused of such
an offence does or does not deserve the
grant of bail in accordance with the
established norms governing the exercise of
such a power. “Afzaal Ahmed vs The
State” (2003 SCMR 573), “ Muhammad
Afzal vs The State” (1997 SCMR 278) &
“Imtiaz Ahmed vs The State” (PLD 1997
SC _ 545). It is not a rule of universal
application. Each case has to be seen
through its own fact and circumstances and
the concession of grant of bail cannot be
exercised in a way which can be termed as
arbitrary, fanciful or perverse. No malafide
or ulterior motive has been attributed on the
part of complainant to falsely implicate the
petitioner in the case. Before his dismissal
from service, petitioner was serving as
Director, Finance, Garrison Cadet College,
Kohat, who has robbed the said college by

committing criminal breach of trust. He was
entrusted with the fees of the students and
other finances, which were earned by their
parents through hard means. He was having
complete dominion over the said money.
Tentatively by filing his affidavit and
executing an agreement with the college
administration of his own sweet will,
provided cheques of different nominations
for its payment on different dates, the very
first cheque being dishonoured due to
insufficient fund, which are in detail
mentioned in the agreement deed dated
12.09.2020, would certainly be a big blow to
his enlargement on bail which will serve as
an exception and would lean the Court to
dismiss this bail application.

7. In view of above, this bail
petition is dismissed, however, the petitioner
is facilitated for an early outcome of the trial
of this case by filing challan before the
competent Court where the trial be held
expeditiously. It is too left entirely to the

Investigation Officer of this case/ District
Public Prosecutor concerned to levy Section
408 PPC, as an added section in the First
Information Report followed by submission
of the challan under the same section of law
and also to the learned Court vested with the
trial to charge the accused (Farman Hussain)
accordingly while framing of the charge.
Announced.
