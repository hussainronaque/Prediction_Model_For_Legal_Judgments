JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN_ KHAN, _J:-Instant appeal under
section 32 of the National Accountability Ordinance
(NAO) 1999, filed by Iftikhar Hussain, the appellant, is
directed against the judgment/order dated 06.11.2014,
passed by the learned Judge Accountability Court No.1,
Peshawar, whereby Plea Bargain’s request of the appellant
was approved, and he was convicted under section 10 of
the NAO, 1999.

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the
instant appeal are that the National Accountability Bureau
(NAB) was inquiring and investigating into a case of
illegal and unauthorized purchase of Transformers for
PK.12, PK-13 and PK-14 by the Officers/Officials of

Public Health Engineering Department Nowshera.
Allegation against the appellant was that he being a
contractor supplied sub-standard Transformers of different
KVs under exorbitant rates and thereby caused huge loss to
the National Exchequer. The appellant was arrested and on
16.10.2014, he filed an application for plea bargain in the
Court of learned Administrative Judge Accountability
Court No.1, Peshawar, which was allowed, consequently,
the appellant was released after having arranged a total
payment of Rs.10,125000/- to the Public Exchequer vide
impugned order dated 06.11.2014.

3. Against the order/judgment dated 06.11.2014, the
appellant filed Writ Petition No.473-P/2015, before this
Court, which along with other writ petitions of co-accused,
was dismissed through a consolidated judgment dated
03.10.2017, being not maintainable on the ground that the
appellant under section 32 of the NAO, 1999 has an
alternative and efficacious remedy to file appeal against the
impugned order. Being discontented, the appellant filed
Civil Petition No.4815 of 2017 before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court against the aforesaid order which along
with CP No.4428 of 2017, was dismissed through a
consolidated order dated 08.01.2018, with the observation
that the appellant, if so advised, may file appeal before this
Court, hence, this appeal.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard

and record perused.
5. On legal premises, record depicts that the
impugned order has been passed on 06.11.2014 by the
Accountability Court No.1, Peshawar, whereby approving
the request of plea bargain of the appellant he was
convicted under section 10 and sentenced under section 15
of the NAO, 1999. The impugned order was appealable
under section 32(a) of the NAO, 1999, which for the sake
of convenience and ready reference is reproduced below:-

32. Appeal (and Revision):

(a) Any person convicted or the Prosecutor
General Accountability, if so directed by
the Chairman NAB, aggrieved by the
final judgment and order of the court
under this Ordinance may, within ten
days of the final judgment and order of
the Court prefer an appeal to the High
Court of the Province where the Court is
situated:

Provided that no appeal shall lie
against any interlocutory order of the
Court.

(b) All Appeals against the final judgment,
filed before the High court will be heard
by a Bench of not less than two judges
constituted by the Chief Justice of High
Court and shall be finally disposed of
within thirty days of the filing of the

appeal.
(c) No. revision shall lie against any

interlocutory order of the Court.
6. The appellant instead of filing appeal, filed WP
No.473-P/2015, which was dismissed on the same ground
that the appellant has an alternate and efficacious remedy
under section 32 of NAO, 1999, to file appeal against the
impugned order. Relevant part of the judgment is
reproduced below:-
“In view of the above, the impression and
intention of the legislature is very clear as plea
bargain amounts to confession, without
contesting the allegation and as_ such
confession amounts to conviction, therefore,
the plea of deeming clause would not held the
petitioner and under the special law he was
supposed to have filed an appeal and not the
writ petition. Moreover, the petitioner has not
executed any affidavit that he is willing to
face the charges, in case the plea bargain is
reversed, because reversal of plea bargain in
the charge against the accused still exists and
to be tried on merits. (Emphasis supplied).
7. The appellant instead honouring and following the
judgment (supra) of this Court, filed Civil Petition No.4815
of 2017, before the Hon’ble Supreme Court which was

dismissed along with CP No.4428 of 2017 through a
consolidated order dated 08.01.2018, in the following
manner:-

“Learned ASC appearing on behalf of the

petitioners, contended that once the High Court

come to the conclusion that appeal was an

adequate remedy in the circumstances of the

case, it should not have discussed the merits of

the case. Be all that as it may, since the writ

petition has been dismissed by the High Court

as being un-maintainable, we would not

interfere with the impugned judgment. These

petitions are thus, dismissed. However, the

petitioners, if so advised, may file appeals

before the High Court.”
8. In view of the above backdrop, the appellant has
filed the instant appeal. The impugned order has been
passed on 06.11.2014. Under Section 32 of the NAO,
1999, the appellant was bound to file appeal within ten
days, but he did not. This Court while dismissing his writ
petition, in unequivocal words ruled that writ petition is
not competent because the impugned order is appealable,
but the appellant despite that resorted to Hon’ble Supreme
Court, where his Civil Petition was dismissed vide order
08.01.2018, in the above quoted terms. The appellant, after
decision of the august supreme Court has filed, the instant
appeal 15.09.2018 i.e. after a period of more than eight

months, which is hopelessly time barred. Even if the
period spent in between filing of writ petition and civil
Petition before this Court and august apex court,
respectively, is excluded, the appeal is barred by eight
months. No application for condonation of delay has been

filed by the appellant. In case titled, “Gen.(R) Parvez

Musharraf vs Nadeem Ahmed (Advocate) and another)
(PLD 2014 Supreme Court 585), it has been held by the

Hon’ble Supreme Court that:-

“Principle of audi alteram partem or that
nobody should be condemned unheard was a
principle of natural justice, however, facts of
each case had to be considered before delay
could be condoned and such principle could not
be made an inflexible rule to give license to
someone who knowing fully well that a lis was
pending against him or that a judgment had
been passed against him refused to appear and
when the judgment was passed failed to
challenge the same in time.”

Similarly, in a recent case CA No.1522 of 2013, titled,

6

‘Haji Wajdad Vs _ Provincial Government through

Secretary Board of Revenue Government _ of

99

Balochistan uetta ete” decided on 15.09.2020,

following the ratio of judgment (supra) has held as under:-

“It has by now been settled that, limitation
would run even against void affecting rights
of any person. And no one can _ seek

condonation of delay by challenging solely
on the said basis. The aggrieved person who
files a belated claim against an alleged void
order would have to first plead his
knowledge thereof, and then prove the same
by cogent and reliable evidence, so as to
legally justify his such claim to be within the
period of limitation from the date of his
knowledge”.
9. On merit, the appellant had submitted application

for plea bargain on 16.10.2014 i.e. at the very next date of
his arrest, which is duly signed by him and his counsel.
The application was referred to the Director General NAB
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa having the delegated powers to
accept the same or otherwise. On 31.10.2014, statement of
Syed Daud Ali Shah, Junior Investigation Officer, NAB
was recorded wherein he exhibited the application of the
petitioner for approval of plea bargain as Exh.PB.6.
Statement of the appellant was also recorded on the same
day wherein he voluntarily and without any objection
recorded his statement in the Court. Besides, the entire
amount of plea bargain i.e. Rs.95,15000/- was deposited by
the petitioner through Cheque dated 29.10.2014 in favour
of Chairman NAB, Islamabad. The appellant was having
fifteen days time during which period he has not retracted
from his plea. During entire proceedings the petitioner
remained present before the trial Court but he never
objected over the same. All these circumstances are

sufficient to prove that his plea bargain was based on his
free consent. An iota of material is not available on file to
remotely show any pressure, coercion or duress on the
appellant to make plea bargain.

10. The argument of learned counsel for the appellant
that the plea bargain has been made during inquiry,
therefore, has no legal authenticity is misconceived.
Record depicts that initially inquiry was authorized in the
matter which was later on converted into investigation.
The appellant was arrested during investigation and on the
next date of his arrest, he requested for plea bargain.

11. The amount embezzled by the appellant was the
public property. Due to supply and installation of
sub-standard Electric Transformers, the appellant has not
only caused huge loss to the Government exchequer, but
has also caused inconvenience to the general public.
Despite his willful plea bargain he kept indulge the
respondents NAB in frivolous litigation from the year 2014
till date. After getting liberty through plea bargain, the
appellant entangled the respondents in the litigation up to
the Hon’ble Supreme Court so as to quench his thirst of
revenge by using the courts as a tool. In this view of the
matter, the conduct of the appellant by no stretch of
imagination can be encouraged or countenanced. We have
noted that increase in frivolous and uncalled for litigations
has risen to an alarming and unmanageable degree. Racks

of the Courts have become insufficient for adjusting and
regulating the files of such like litigations. Here, it would
not be out of the context to say that Judicial System is
grievously affected by the habitual and wonted litigants by
frivolous and uncalled for litigations. It has become an
established practice to entangle the opposite party in false
litigations to make it suffer despite knowing the fact that
the matter brought before the court will bore no fruit.
Though, sections 35 and 35-A of the Code of Civil
Procedure, empower the court to impose cost and special
cost upon a party involved in frivolous litigation, however,
in the prevailing circumstances, it does not adequately
cater the nagging situation. For curbing false, frivolous and
vexatious litigations by a party, proper legislation is need
of the day. Such like, false, frivolous and luxurious
litigations, are not only wasting time of the courts, but also
burdened the rival party i.e. private respondents and
Provincial or Federal Governments with heavy expenses.
Case in hand is one of the instance, wherein the petitioner
being involve in a case of corruption, at the very outset
agreed and submitted application to the competent court of
law for allowing him to deposit a portion of amount earned
through corruption. He was allowed by the Court,
consequently, he on deposit of agreed amount, availed the
benefit of release, however, after sometime, by taking a
summersault, he filed a writ petition before this court,

which was dismissed on merit as well as being not
10

maintainable. He then agitated the same grievance before
the august Supreme Court by filing civil petition, which
was also dismissed. The appellant once again brought the
same grievance before this Court through instant appeal,
filed with a delay of more than eight months, that too,
without any application or request for condonation of
delay. We are clear in our view that the appellant
desperately kept the respondents engaged to the hilt since
2014 in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation in
various Courts. He has wasted the judicial time of various
courts for the last almost six years.

12. On consideration of totality of the facts and
circumstances as discussed above, we could not find any
substance in the hopelessly time barred appeal, which is
hereby dismissed with costs which we quantified as rupees
one million, to be paid/deposited by the appellant in the
Government exchequer. Needless to say that we are
imposing the cost to follow the fundamental principle that
wrong doer should not be allowed to get benefit out of
frivolous litigation
