JUDGMENT

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- This Jail Criminal Appeal,
filed by Mst. Shakira, the appellant, is directed against
the judgment dated 05.12.2022, passed by learned
ASJ/Judge Model Criminal Trial Court, Mardan,
whereby the appellant having been found guilty of
committing the Qatl-e-Amd of Mst. Marjina and
Azkan, has been convicted under section 302 (b) PPC
and sentenced to imprisonment for life as Ta’azir on
two counts and to pay Rs.4,00,000/- as compensation
under section 544-A Cr.P.C., to legal heirs of the
deceased and in default thereof to further undergo six
months simple imprisonment, vide case FIR No.78
dated 16.01.2019, registered under sections 302/34

PPC, at Police Station Jabbar, District Mardan. Benefit
of Section 382-B Cr.P.C., has been extended to the
appellant.

2. The prosecution’s case as per First Information
Report (FIR) Exh.PA is that on 16.01.2019 at 1900
hours, Kiramat Ullah complainant (PW.12), in
company of dead bodies of his daughter, namely,
Mst. Marjina and grandson, namely, Azkan aged 2/3
years, reported to Abdul Sattar Khan SI (PW.11) in
Casualty Hospital Mardan to the effect that on
16.01.2019 he was present in his house, situated in
Sawal Dher Mardan, when received information about
murder of his daughter and grandson named above in
the house of Habib Ullah (acquitted co-accused), on
which he rushed to the spot where he learnt that her
deceased daughter and grandson had come to the house
of Habib Ullah for Khatmul Quran, where they were
done to death by Mr. Shakira (appellant) with firearm.
He alleged that the incident is witnessed by
Mst. Madiha and other inmates of the house. His
report was recorded into the shape of Murasila
Exh.PA/1 on the basis of which FIR Exh.PA was
registered against the appellant and co-accused Habib
Ullah.

3. On completion of investigation challan was
submitted against both the accused. After facing

regular trial, accused Habib Ullah was acquitted while
appellant was convicted and sentenced as mentioned in
the initial paragraph of this judgment, hence, this
appeal.
4. During arguments it came to limelight that on
13.06.2019 when the case was fixed for framing of
charge, the appellant submitted an application before
the learned Trial Court that she being suffering from
mental disorder, she be examined through Standing
Medical Board. The learned trial Court instead of
allowing her request, placed on file the application
with the observation the appellant will be medically
examined at proper time, either on the request of
learned defence counsel or APP for the State and
framed charge against the appellant, where question
“Do you plead guilty to the charge? was replied by
the appellant in the following words:-

“Yes I plead my guilt. I have

committed the offence but at_the

time of commission of offence I had

lost_my senses. Moreover, I was

apprehending death at the hands of

deceased Mst. Marjina, therefore, I

committed the offence due to said

apprehension.”
Stance of the appellant regarding her mental illness is

also manifest from her reply to the charge but the
learned trial Court despite that, invited the
prosecution’s evidence and proceeded with the trial.
5. The matter does not end here; on 30.11.2019
learned counsel for the defence once again submitted
an application for postponement of proceedings against
the appellant due to her mental illness under section
465 Cr.P.C. Notice of the application was given to the
State and case was fixed for arguments on the said
application for 14.12.2019, nevertheless, no order was
passed thereafter on the application, rather the trial
against the appellant was concluded and she was
ultimately convicted and sentenced.
6. The claim of mental illness of the appellant has
been categorically admitted by complainant Kiramat
Ullah (PW.12) in his examination in chief in the
following words:-
“Stated that Mst. Marjina deceased was my
daughter and deceased Azkan was my
grandson. I was informed by my son
Amanat Gul through mobile that his
(Amanat Gul’s) wife and minor son have
been murdered by Mst. Shakira, who_is
mentally retorted.”

7. Even at this stage when the complainant
himself admitted the mental illness of the appellant;
the learned Trial Court did not bother to refer the

appellant to the Standing Medical Board for
examination and thereafter to proceed with the case in
accordance with law, rather opted to conclude the trial
without adverting to the provisions of section 465
Cr.P.C. which provides that if any person before a
Court of Sessions or a High Court appears to the court
at his trial to be of unsound mind and consequently
incapable of making his defence the court shall, in the
first instance, try the fact of such unsoundness and
incapacity, and if the Court is satisfied of the fact, it
shall record a finding to that effect and shall postpone
further proceedings in the case and the trial of the fact
of unsoundness of mind and incapacity of the accused
shall be deemed to be part of his trial before the court.
In this case despite repeated requests of the appellant
regarding her mental incapacity as well as admission
of complainant about illness of the appellant, the
mandatory provisions of section 465 Cr.P.C. were not
complied with. The Hon’ble Supreme Court while
dealing with identical controversy in case titled,
“Sirajuddin Vs Afzal Khan and another” (PLD
1997 Supreme Court 847) has held that:-

“Whenever question of insanity is
brought to the notice of the court it shall
satisfy itself in the manner provided
under the law as to whether the person is
capable of understanding the trial and

defending himself. Medical evidence is
of utomost importance for such

satisfaction”.

In the recent past the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its
authoritative judgment rendered in case titled, “Most.
Safia Bano_and_ another _Vs_ Home Department

Government of Punjab through Secretary and others”
(PLD 2021 Supreme Court _488), after elaborate

discussion on section 84 PPC and sections 464 and 465
Cr.P.C. and referring to precedent settled by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the past, has answered questions “How
should the trial court deal with the claim that due to
mental illness, an accused is incapable of making
his/her defence? and “Whether the trial court can form
a prima facie subjective view regarding the incapability
of the accused to make his/her defence without seeking
the opinion of the medical expert? in the following
manner:-
“Once the court has formed a prima facie

tentative opinion, that the accused may be
incapable of understanding the proceedings

of trial or make his/her defence, it becomes

obligatory upon the court to embark upon
conducting an inquiry to decide the issue of
incapacity of the accused to face trial due to

mental illness. Medical opinion is sine qua
non in such an inquiry. For this purpose, the

Court must get the accused examined by a
Medical Board, to be notified by the
Provincial Government, consisting of
qualified medical experts in the field of
mental health, to examine the accused person
and opine whether accused is capable or
otherwise to understand the proceedings of
trial and make his/her defence. The
report/opinion of the Medical Board must not
be a mere diagnosis of a mental illness or
absence thereof. It must be a detailed and
structured report with specific reference to
psychopathology (if any) in the mental
functions of consciousness, intellect,
thinking, mood, emotions, perceptions,
cognition, judgment and insight. The head of
the Medical Board shall then be examined as
Court witness and such examination shall be
reduced in writing. Both the prosecution and
defence should be given an opportunity to
cross-examine him in support of their
respective stance. Thereafter, if the accused
wishes to adduce any evidence in support of
his/her claim, then he/she should be allowed
to produce such evidence, including expert
opinion with the prosecution given an
opportunity to cross-examined. Similarly, the
prosecution may also be allowed to produce
evidence which it deems relevant to this
preliminary issue with opportunity given to

the defence to cross-examine. It is upon the
consideration of this evidence procured and
adduced before the Court that finding on this
question of fact i.e. the capability of the
accused to face trial within the contemplation
of sections 464 and 465 Cr.P.C. shall be

recorded by the Court.”

8. Deriving wisdom and placing reliance on the
judgments (supra) of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, we
without dilating upon merits of the case, set-aside the
conviction and sentences of the appellant recorded by
the learned trial court vide judgment dated 05.12.2022,
and remand the case to the learned trial Court with
direction to conduct an inquiry regarding mental
illness of the appellant after examining her through
Standing Medical Board consisting of qualified
medical experts in the field of mental health, who shall
opine whether the appellant is capable or otherwise to
understand the proceedings of trial and make her
defence. The head of the Medical Board shall then be
examined as Court witness and both, the prosecution
and defence, should be given an opportunity to cross-
examine him in support of their respective stance.
Thereafter, if the appellant wishes to adduce any
evidence in support of her claim, she should be
allowed to produce such evidence. Similarly, the
prosecution may also be allowed to produce evidence

which it deems relevant to the controversy with
opportunity given to the defence to cross-examine
prosecution evidence. After considering the evidence
procured and adduced, the learned trial court shall
determine fact ie. the capability of the appellant to
face trial and proceed with the case in accordance with
law. During proceedings before the learned trial court,
the appellant shall be treated as an under trial prisoner.

9. The Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this
court, after obtaining permission of Hon’ble the Chief
Justice, shall send copy of this judgment to the learned
Sessions Judges of each District of the Province of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who shall onward circulate
copy thereof amongst all the criminal Courts/Special
Courts in his/her concerned District for guidance and
strict compliance in the future.
