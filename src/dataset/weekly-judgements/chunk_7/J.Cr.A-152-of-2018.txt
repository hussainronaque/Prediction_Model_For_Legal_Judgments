4. . After completion of investigation,
complete challan was put in Court and the appellant
was formally indicted for the offences to which he
did not plead guilty. Prosecution produced nine (09)
PWs in support of the allegations against the
appellant and closed the evidence. When examined
u/s 342, €rP.C on 24.08.2013, the appellant/convict
denied the allegation of prosecution, however, he
neither recorded his own statement on oath nor
produced any witness his defence. It is pertinent to
note here: that complainant submitted application for
recording additional statement of the appellant u/s
342, Cr.P.C which was accepted vide order dated
11.12.2013 and additional statement of the appellant
ws 342, Cr.P.C. was recorded on 11.12.2013
wherein ‘he recorded his answers against additional
Question Nos. 16 and 17. On conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court vide judgment dated 05.05.2014
convicted him u/s 302(b) PPC for the murders of his
wives ‘and sentenced him to undergo life
imprisonment on two counts.

5. The appellant/convict preferred JCr.A
No. 156-M/2014 before this Court through jail
authorities. During the course of arguments in the

said appeal, it was brought into the notice of this

Court that charge u/s 202 PPC and 13 A.O had not
been framed against the appellant, therefore, this
Court accepted the appeal vide judgment dated
16.10.2017 by setting aside the judgment of the trial
Court and remanded the case to trial Court with the
directions to frame amended charge against the
appellant by indicting him u/s 202 PPC and 13 A.O
as well and after recording statements of necessary
PWs, the trial Court was further directed to rewrite
the judgment afresh.

After remand of the case, the learned
trial Court framed fresh charge against the appellant
u/s 202 PPC & 13 A.O on 16.11.2017 to which he
did ‘not plead guilty. The complainant side
submitted an application with regard to non-
examination of the PWs on the leftover sections 202
PPC and 13 A.O on the ground that some of the
PWs already examined were dead whereas the
complainant was abroad. The said application was
supported by State by relying upon the statements
of PWs already recorded during the pre-remand
proceedings.

On completion of post-remand trial
proceedings, the learned trial Court vide judgment

dated 15.05.2018 again convicted the present

Hon'ble Mr Justice Wiger Ahmad
‘Tafamul/PS*

appellant for committing murders of his wives and
sentenced him in the manner as discussed in detail
in the first para of this judgment. Hence, this appeal.
vA We have heard the arguments of
learned counsel for the parties including the learned
A.A.G. and perused the record with their able
assistance..

8. No doubt, the occurrence had taken
place at unknown date and time and the matter was
brought into the notice of police after considerable
period of time but keeping in view the attending
circumstances of the present case, prosecution could
neither be held responsible for the delayed report nor
could be burdened to produce an eye witness of the
occurrence. Admittedly, both the deceased ladies
were wives of the present appellant and their dead
bodies have been recovered from a room of his
house in presence of responsible police officers,
Executive Magistrate as well as team of doctors
including two lady doctors one of whom was

examined before the Court as PW-9.

9. In the first phase, prosecution has

discharged its onus to prove that dead bodies of the

two wives of the present appellant had been

os: Hon’ble Mr. tustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Henvbte Mr Justice Winer Ahmad
Tajamul/Ps*

-8-

recovered from his residential house. In this regard,
Aman Ullah and complainant Wasi Ullah were
examined as PW-1 and PW-3 respectively. The
former is nephew of deceased Mst. Bakht Sultana
who duly identified her dead body during the course
of exhumation. During cross-examination, he
admitted that the present appellant was present in
custody of police during excavation of the grave and
further admitted that he had dug out the grave
through mattock and spade which were available in
the house of the appellant. In response to a question
of defence counsel, PW-1 further stated that the
present appellant had disclosed that the grave was of
his two wives. This witness has duly attested
identification memo of the grave (Ex.PW-1/1), |
recovery memo of dead bodies (Ex.PW-1/2) and

identification meme of dead bodies (Ex.PW-1/3).

Complainant Wasi Ullah is son of
deceased Mst. Sherin Mahal from her previous
husband late Amir Khan, brother of the present
appellant. After death of her previous husband, the
present appellant contracted marriage with her.

During the course of exhumation, complainant duly

Hon'ble Mr. justice Winer Ahmad
Tajamnul/Ps* |

-9-
identified dead body of his mother. The complainant
has put his signatures on recovery memo Ex.PW-1/2
regarding dead bodies of the two ladies as welis the
memo (Ex.PW-2/2) regarding handing over back of

the dead bodies for reburial.

. ‘ Bacha Munir (PW-2) was also present
at the time when dead bodies of the two ladies were
recovered from a combined grave inside the house
of the present appellant, besides he is marginal
witness of recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1 through
which empties of 7.62 bore and a spent bullet were

taken into possession from the place of occurrence.

Police have also recovered the crime
weapon.frém the present appellant at the time of his
arrest from the house of his maternal cousin on the
date of exhumation. Prosecution has examined Amir
Dad Khan as PW-6 in support of the aforesaid
récovery-of crime weapon which has matched with
the crime empties recovered from the Spot as is

evident from FSL report Ex.PW-4/6.

All the above referred documents
prepared’ by Investigating Officer Muhammad Siraj

Khan S.I (PW-4) and signed/thumb impressed by the

oa: Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtlag Ibrahim
Honthis Me Justice Wiger Ahmad
-10-

PWs nained ‘above, were duly attested by Executive

Magistrate Mian Ayan Ullah (PW-7). All the PWs
including the I.O and Executive Magistrate have
been subjected to lengthy cross-examination but
nothing could be brought on the record from them to
create a reasonable suspicion with regard to the

process of exhumation.

10. '. The team of doctors comprising of
Dr. Bushra Naureen WMO, Dr. Matiul Haq MO,
Dr. Shabana WMO and Miss Shaheen (Charge -
Nurse) had visited the spot for the purpose of
exhumation who have prepared the exhumation
report Ex.PW-9/1 after completion of the process.
Dr. Bushra Naureen has appeared before the trial
Court as (PW-9) in support of the said report and
confirmed présence of firearm injuries on bodies of
both the deceased. Thus, the circumstantial evidence
discussed above corroborate the allegation against
the appellant that he had committed murders of his
wives and thereafter buried them in a room of his

house.

il. The appellant/convict has led the police
and team of doctors to the place where he had

buried his wives after committing their murders

through ‘firing. The récovery of dead bodies from
his residential house is a strong piece of
circumstantial evidence against him which alone is
sufficient’ to prove that none else but he had

committed murders of his wives. In the case of “Sh.

Muhammad Amjad V/s. The State” (PLD 2003 S.C
704) the Hon’ble apex Court while discussing
recovery of dead body of the deceased child from
the house under the control of accused in the said

case, observed that:

“33. All above pieces of circumstantial evidence
when combined together provided a strong chain
of circumstances leading to the irresistible
conclusion that it was the appellant and the
appellant alone; who had killed the deceased. It
was also established that the bungalow in
question was in possession of the appellant from
where the dead body was recovered. It was also
established by an unimpeachable evidence that
recoveries of dead body, car and other articles
were: made on the lead, provided by the
appellant. All above pieces of evidence under
Article 40 ibid are admissible and were proved
by conclusive evidence”.

12. Prosecution has established through
unbreakable chain of circumstantial evidence that
the present appellant was involved in committing
murders of his two wives, hence, prosecution has
discharged its onus. Although, it is settled principle

of law that prosecution is bound to prove its case

-12-

against the accused and the said burden could not be
shifted to } accused but keeping in view the
relationship of the two deceased with the present
appellant, he was at least bound to offer explanation
regarding disappearance of his wives otherwise he
would cast ‘a shadow of doubt on himself. Though
has taken the plea of alibi during his examination
under section 342, CrP.c by stating that he had
proceeded to Kashmir for earning his livelihood and
when returned to his house one day prior to his
arrest after two months and twenty days, he found
his wives missing with further assertions that he was
trying to find traces of his missing wives but the
complainant arrested him through police with mala
fide as he himself with others was involved in the
murders of his wives but the above plea of the
appellant was nowhere suggested to the PWs nor the
same does find a fit place in the attending
circumstances of the case. Admittedly the
occurrence has taken place in 2011 and long before
the said year the world had turned into a global
village because of effective communication
resources through modern technology in shape of
cellular phones. It does not appeal to prudent mind

that the appellant during his alleged stay in Kashmir

OB: Hon’ole Mr. fustice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon’bie Mr. Justice Wigar Atmad
Tajemuyrss|

-13-

never contacted his wives especially when there was
no other male member in his house to protect them
and help them in bringing ration and other necessary
things of daily use for them. Moreso, it cannot be
expected from an ordinary man to presume that his
wives were living safe and sound lives without
confronting any disease or accident. Thus, the plea
raised by the appellant could not be accepted in the
mentioned circumstances rather he has made a lame
endeavor to save his skin by raising the plea of alibi.
In such situation when the plea raised by the
appellant could not be accepted being absurd and
irrational, he was bound to explain that what had
happened to his wives and how their dead bodies
were buried inside a room of his house. While
highlighting such responsibility of the accused in the
case of Saeed Ahmad Vs. The State reported as 2015
SCMR 710, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan

observed that:

~ 14, That with regard to vulnerable
members of society, such as children, women
and the infirm, who were living with the accused
or were last in his company the accused ought to
offer some explanation of what happened to
them. If instead he remains silent or offers a
false explanation he casts a shadow upon
himself. This does not mean that the burden of
proof has shifted onto the accused as it is for the
prosecution to prove its case, however, in respect
of the helpless or the weak that require

bb: Hon'ble Mr, Justice tehtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiosr Ahmed
Torrmutyes*|

-14.

protection or care it would not be sufficient for
the accused to stay silent in circumstances which
tend to incriminate him, and if he elects to do so
he lightens the burden of the prosecution. Article
122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order too
stipulates that if a particular fact is especially
within the knowledge of any person the burden
of proving that fact is upon him. In the present
case the prosecution had established its case
against the appellant; two eye-witnesses had
deposed against him and the medical evidence
confirmed strangulation of the deceased. The
appellant did not attend to the last rites of his
wife who had died whilst residing with him, he
also did not inform the police nor took his wife
to a hospital and disappeared for two months,
such circumstances corroborate the prosecution
case in the absence of the appellant offering a
reasonable explanation for his unnatural
conduct. .

13. | Admittedly, wives of the appellant have
met unnatural deaths through firing as per.
exhumation“ report. The appellant has neither
announced their funeral prayers according to custom
of the area nor made any report to police nor there is
any evidence to show that he had taken his wives in
injured condition to hospital for saving their lives.
This conduct of the appellant is relevant under
Article 122 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984
according to which if a particular fact is especially
within the knowledge of any person the burden of
proving that fact is upon him. Thus, in light of his
failure to offer explanation regarding the afore-

referred unnatural happening inside his house, we

oe: Hon'ble Mr. Justica Ishtleg tbrahim
Hon‘ble Mr Justice Wiger Ahmad
-15-

reach to the irresistible conclusion that the present
appellant has killed his wives and thereafter secretly
buried them in a room of his house to conceal his

crime.

Before winding up the above
discussion, we deem it appropriate to meet the
objection of learned counsel for the complainant
with regard to non-specification of the quantum of
sentence on two counts by learned trial Court.
Though the learned trial Court has not specifically
mentioned the words ‘two counts’ while awarding
the sentences of life imprisonment to appellant but
the concluding para of the judgment transpires that
while awarding the sentence of life imprisonment to
him, the name of each deceased was specifically
mentioned which implied means that the said

sentence was on two counts.

14, In light of what has been discussed
above, the learned trial Court has convicted the
appellant through a well-reasoned judgment after
correct appreciation of evidence on record besides
the sentences awarded to him by trial Court are just
and appropriate in circumstances of the case,

therefore, the impugned judgment calls for no

interference by this Court. Resultantly, this appeal,

being devoid of merits, is accordingly dismissed.
