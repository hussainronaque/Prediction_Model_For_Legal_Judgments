JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Muhammad Irfan, seeks bail in case FIR No.416 dated
17.06.2015, registered under sections 302/34 PPC in Police
Station Urmar, wherein he alongwith co-accused Javed
(already on bail), is charged for committing the Qatl-e-
Amd of Kamran Shah deceased.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the record that neither
complainant nor anybody esle has furnished the ocular
account of the incident. Though petitioner has been
directly charged by complainant in the FIR for the murder
of the deceased, but has not furnished the source of his
satisfaction qua complicity of the petitioner in the
commission of offence. Similarly, according to the

allegations in the FIR, the deceased was done to death by

the accused by throwing him in a well known as “Ghughal
Zai Baba Well”, but as per autopsy report, firearm injury
was found on the person of the deceased. The petitioner
has not confessed his guilt before the competent court of
law. Co-accused Javed, whose role is identical to that of
the petitioner has already been granted bail by this court
against which no BCA has been filed, therefore, on the
principle of consistency, the petitioner is also entitled to
concession of bail.

4. Accordingly, this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided he
furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
