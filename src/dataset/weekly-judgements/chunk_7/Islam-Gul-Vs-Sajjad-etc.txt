ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

This appeal, filed by appellant Islam Gul, calls

in question the legality and property of judgment

dated 18.07.2011, rendered by learned Trial

Court/ Additional Sessions Judge-V, Peshawar,

whereby he convicted and sentenced the

appellant as under:-

Under Section 302 (b) PPC:- For

deceased, to undergo imprisonment

for life and to pay Rs.1,00,000/- as

compensation within the meaning of

§8.544-A Cr.P.C. to LRs of the

deceased or in default thereof to

Gul, to undergo 10 years R.I.

Both the sentences have been

directed to run concurrently. Benefit

of §.382-B Cr.P.C. has been

The prosecution case is that

on

15.02.2009 at 2010 hours, complainant Sajjad

(PW.5), in injured condition, in company of his

brother Himayat Ullah (PW.6), reported to local

police in Tangi hospital Charsadda that on the

fateful night, after offering “Isha prayer” in

village Mosque, when he alongwith his father

Hayat Gul reached near their house situated in

“Rehmat Kala”, Islam Gul (appellant-convict

herein) alongwith absconding co-accused Abdul

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

Hakeem, already ambushed there, opened fire at

them, with the intention to commit their

qatl-e-Amd, as a result, his father got hit and

died on the spot, while he sustained injuries; that

his sister Mst. Najia Begum, wife of the

absconding co-accused Abdul Hakeem, due to

strained relation with her husband, has left her

house and is residing with them, which became

motive behind the incident.

3. Report of the complainant was reduced

into writing in the shape of murasila Exh.PA/1

by Fazal Hadi SI (PW.8), on the basis of which,

FIR No.104 dated 15.02.2009 under sections

302/324/34 PPC, was registered in Police

Station Umarzai. He prepared injury sheet of

injured Sajjad Exh.PW.8/1, injury sheet and

inquest report of deceased Hayat Gul

Exh.PW.8/2 and Exh.PW.8/3 and referred the

injured for medical examination as well as

shifted the dead body of the deceassed to the

4. Sabz Ali Khan SI — conducted

investigation in the case. He proceeded to the

spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB on

pointation of eyewitness Himayat Ullah. During

spot inspection, he secured bloodstained earth

and pebbles from the places of the deceased and

injured vide recovery memo Exh.PW.3/2, took

into possession 13 empties of 7.62 bore vide

recovery memo Exh.PW.10/1. Vide recovery

memo Exh.PW.10/2, he took into possession

the last worn bloodstained garments of the

deceased. Since accused were avoiding their

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

lawful arrest, therefore, he initiated proceedings

under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C. against them,

sent the bloodstained articles and the empties to

the FSL, reports whereof are Exh.PZ and

Exh.PZ/1, recorded statements of the PWs under

section 161 Cr.P.C. and on completion of

investigation, handed over case file to the SHO,

who submitted challan under section 512

Cr.P.C. against the accused.

5. Later on, appellant-accused was arrested

and supplementary challan was submitted

against him before the learned Trial Court,

where he was formally charge sheeted, to which

he pleaded not guilty and claimed Trial. To

bring home the guilt of appellant, prosecution

examined as many as eleven witnesses. After

closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of

the appellant was recorded under section 342

Cr.P.C., wherein he denied the prosecution

allegations and professed his innocence. He

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

declined to be examined on oath however, opted

to produce evidence in defence. Gohar Ali was

produced in defence as DW.1. On conclusion of

trial, the learned Trial Court, after hearing both

the sides, vide impugned judgment convicted

and sentenced the appellant, as mentioned

above, hence, this appeal.

6. Learned counsel for the appellant

argued that being a night occurrence,

complainant has not disclosed about any source

of light on the spot therefore, identification of

the accused is highly doubtful; that

non-mentioning of specific kind of weapons by

the complainant in his report, used in the

commission of offence, is another fact which

speaks that he was not able to identify the

assailant/ assailants; that PW Himayat Ullah is

not named in the FIR as an _ eyewitness,

therefore, his testimony cannot be believed; that

charge has been exaggerated because as per FSL

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

report, all 13 empties of 7.62, taken from the

spot have been fired from single weapon; that

the impugned judgment being based on surmises

and conjecture is liable to be set at naught.

7. Conversely, learned AAG assisted

by learned counsel for the complainant

contended that appellant is directly charged by

injured complainant in a promptly lodged report;

that keeping in view the distance of few paces

between the accused and the complainant as

well as their close relation with each other,

question of mistaken identity even in the dark

does not arise; that injured complainant and PW

Himayat Ullah have furnished truthful account

of the occurrence and defence failed to shatter

their testimony; that recovery of blood from the

spot, the bloodstained garments of the deceased

and injured coupled with positive Serologist

report and recovery of 13 crime empties from

10

the spot, corroborate the ocular account; that

prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant

through overwhelming ocular — evidence

supported by medical and _ circumstantial

evidence, therefore, the learned Trial Court was

justified by holding the appellant guilty of the

offence. They sought dismissal of the appeal.

8. The incident is nocturnal having

taken place at 07.50 p.m. after “Isha prayer

time” in the month of February. The crime

venue is a thoroughfare of “Rehmat Kala”, near

the house of the complainant. Complainant

Sajjad has not disclosed about availability of any

source of light on the spot at the time of incident,

nor has any source of light been taken into

possession by Investigating Officer during spot

inspection nor shown in the site plan Exh.PB.

Complainant has also not given specific kind of the

weapon used in the commission of offence by the

assailant. The argument of the learned counsel

11

for the complainant as well as the finding of the

learned Trial Court that since the accused and

complainant party are relatives, therefore, a

relative can identify a relative even in the dark

from close proximity of 5 to 6 paces on the basis

of features and structure, are unpersuasive

because on this analogy believing the

identification of the accused, would amount to

presumption and presumption how much strong

may be, cannot be a substitute of proof. Had

there been any conversation between the parties

before the occurrence, then the aforesaid

argument and finding of the learned Trial Court,

would have some force, but such is not the case

of the prosecution. The site plan has not been

prepared at the  pointation of injured

complainant, rather on the pointation of one

Himayat Ullah, who does not figure anywhere in

the FIR as an eyewitness, therefore, the distance

of 5 to 6 paces between the complainant and the

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

12

accused given by him, cannot be believed

because it does not appeal to our mind that the

assailant selecting a night time especially for

concealing his identity, would commit such

stupidity and blunder to come so closer to his

target. The FSL report qua 13 empties of 7.62

bore to have been fired from single weapon, is

another strong piece of evidence indicating

towards the inability of complainant to identify

the number of assailant and makes the

identification highly doubtful. In view of the

above, we are firm in our view that albeit,

complainant Sajjad sustained injuries in the

incident, on the basis of which his presence

cannot be denied at the relevant time of incident,

yet we are firm in our view that he was not at all

able to identify the assailant because of the

darkness, therefore, his testimony by virtue of

having stamp of injuries, cannot be blindly believed

and relied upon. It has been held by the Apex Court

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

13

in plethora of judgments that though presence of

an injured witness on the spot at the relevant

time of incident cannot be denied, but mere

injuries on his person, cannot be a certificate of

his truthfulness.

9. So far as the testimony of Himayat

Ullah (PW.6), who poses himself to be the

eyewitness of the incident, suffice it to say that

he does not figure anywhere as an eyewitness in

the initial report. He is the brother of

complainant and in his presence the incident had

allegedly been reported which he signed as a

rider. Had he been present at the relevant time of

incident, being brother of the complainant, the

complainant would have disclosed him as

eyewitness or at least PW Himayat Ullah while

verifying the report of complainant could have

brought this aspect into notice of the author of

murasila, but such is not the position herein,

which shows that PW Himayat Ullah is a

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

14

procured witness, therefore, his testimony has

wrongly been taken into consideration and relied

upon by the learned Trial Court. It has been held

by the Apex Court in case titled, “Rashid

Ahmed Vs Muhammad Nawaz and others”

(2006 SCMR 1152), that testimony of the

prosecution witness not mentioned in the FIR,

but introduced subsequently, had no evidentiary

value. Taking guidance from the judgment of the

Apex Court, we straight-away exclude the

testimony of PW Himayat Ullah from

consideration.

10. In view of the above discussion we have

reached to an irresistible conclusion that though

injured Sajjad sustained injuries in the incident,

but he was not in a position at all to identify the

assailant and this aspect of the case alone would

be sufficient to destroy the entire edifice of the

prosecution case.

15

11. The identification of the appellant

being highly doubtful, cast serious doubt in the

prosecution case, benefit of which would be

extended to the appellant not as a matter of

grace or concession but as a matter of right. The

rule of benefit of doubt is essential a rule of

prudence, which cannot be ignored while

dispensing justice in accordance with law.

Conviction must be based on unimpeachable

evidence and certainty of guilt and any doubt

arising in the prosecution case, must be resolved

in favour of the accused. The said rule is based

on the maxim that “it is better that ten guilty

persons be acquitted rather than one innocent

person be convicted”, which occupied a pivotal

place in the Islamic Law and is enforced strictly

in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet

(PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in

releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in

punishing an innocent”. Reliance placed on case

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

16

titled, “Muhammad Khan and another versus the

State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and case titled

“Muhammad Ikram Vs the State” (2009 SCMR

230).

12. The learned Trial Court failed to

evaluate the available evidence in its true

perspective and thus reached to erroneous

conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the

offence. We, by allowing this appeal, set aside

the conviction and sentences of the appellant

recorded by the learned Trial Court vide

impugned judgment dated 18.07.2011, and

hereby acquit him of the charges levelled against

him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not

required in any other case.

These are reasons of our short order of

even date, which read as follow:-

“For reasons to be recorded later

on, this appeal is allowed. The

conviction and sentences of the

17

appellant, namely, Islam Gul,

awarded to him in case FIR no.104

dated 15.02.2009, under sections

302/324/34 PPC, Police Station

Umarzai District Charsadda by

learned Additional Sessions Judge-

V, Charsadda vide impugned

judgment dated 18.07.2011 are set

aside and he is acquitted of the

charges levelled against him. He be

released from jail forthwith, if not

required in any other case”.
