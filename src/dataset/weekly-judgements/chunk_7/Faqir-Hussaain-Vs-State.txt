JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Faqir Hussain, seeks bail in case FIR

No.375 dated 23.06.2015, registered under

sections 324/427/34 PPC, in Police Station

Parang Charsadda, wherein he alongwith

co-accused Ihsanullah and Amanat, is charged

for attempting at the lives of complainant and

his sons Sajjad Ahmad and Waqas Ahmed by

firing at them, as a result, motorcar parked

inside their house was hit while they luckily

remained unscathed. A brawl inter-se petitioner

Faqir Hussain and sons of the complainant has

been alleged as motive behind the incident.

2. None on behalf of the complainant has

sustained any injury in the incident due to

alleged firing of the petitioner, therefore, at the

moment, applicability of section 324 PPC and

intention to do the complainant party away, is a

debatable question to be properly answered by

the prosecution during trial after recording

evidence whereas punishment of section 427

PPC, does not fall within the Restrictive limb of

S.497 Cr.P.C., hence, the case of the petitioner

being arguable for the purpose of bail, I am

inclined to exercise the discretion of bail in his

favour.

3. Accordingly, the petition is allowed.

Petitioner is admitted to bail provided he

furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/-

with two local and reliable sureties each in the

like amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa

Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned.
