by learned Sessions Judge Hangu and on conclusion of
trial, both having been found guilty of abducting
Muhammad Yasir, a minor boy of 7/8 years, and

2. Against their conviction and sentences,

filed Cr.R. No.33-P of 2019, seeking enhancement of
sentences of the convicts/respondents from life

3. As both the appeals and the criminal
revision petition are emanating from one and the same
judgment dated 09.02.2019, of the learned Trial Court,
rendered in one and the same FIR, therefore, we
propose to decide the same through this single
judgment.
4. The prosecution’s case in brief is that on

17.09.2017 Alam Jan complainant (PW.14) submitted
an application/complaint Exh.PW.9/1 to SHO Police
Station Thall District Hangu to the effect that on
30.08.2017 at about 12.00 noon, his minor son,
namely, Muhammad Yasir aged about 7/8 years, had
gone missing from “Bannu Chowk Israfeel Market
Thall”. He came to know from footages of CCTV
Cameras installed on Israfeel Market and United Bank
Thall that his son has been abducted by Moulana
Imdad Ullah (appellant), a prayer leader (Pesh Imam)
of village Boland Khel and when he contacted and
asked him about his son, appellant Imdad Ullah told
him that he will hand him over the minor at 0300
hours; that later on, when he tried to contact appellant
Imdad Ullah, his both cell phone Nos.0313-1333600
and 03029896060 were switched off; that he is
satisfied that his minor son has been abducted by
Moulana Imdad Ullah. On the complaint/application
of the complainant FIR Exh.PA was registered in
Police Station Thall by Mohib Ullah SI (PW.9) and on
the same day he arrested appellant Imdad Ullah at
Chapperi road along with appellant Muhammad Tahir.
On cursory interrogation of appellant Imdad Ullah at
the spot of his arrest, he disclosed that he has killed
minor Muhammad Yasir by putting big stones on his
body in Khadimak Pahar. Mohib Ullah SI, issued his

arrest card Exh.PW.9/2 and Exh.PW.9/3 of the
appellant and thereafter on the pointation/discovery of
appellant Imdad Ullah, recovered the dead body of the
minor deceased in presence of Badshah Zar (PW.3)
and Doctor Muhammad Ayaz, vide pointation memo
Exhs.PC/2. On the spot, he telephonically informed
Abdur Rehman SI (PW.10), the Investigating Officer
of the case, to reach the spot, who accordingly
proceeded to Khadimak pahar where the appellants
were handed over to him. Abdur Rehman SI (PW.10),
prepared injury sheet Exh.PW.9/4 and inquest report
Exh.PW.9/5 of the deceased as well as prepared sketch
of the place of recovery of dead body of the deceased
Exh.PB/1, recorded statements of the PWs under
section 161 Cr.P.C. During spot inspection, he
recovered and took into possession stones stained with
blood and fats vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/1. He
also took into possession USB containing footages of
CCTV Cameras, produced by complainant through
recovery memo in presence of PWs Jamshid and Sahib
Gul and the last worn clothes of the deceased stained
with flash and fats vide recovery memo Exh.PW.6/2,
obtained physical remand of the appellants and
interrogated them. During interrogation appellant
Muhammad Tahir disclosed that his motorcycle was
used by appellant Imdadullah for taking the minor

deceased to Khadimak hill which is parked in “Dar ul
”

Uloom” Thall. He recovered the said motorcycle
Exh.P.1 along with its registration Exh.P.2 and took
the same through recovery memo Exh.PW.10/2 in
presence of witnesses. He also took into possession
CDR of mobile numbers of the appellants consisting of
41 sheets Exh.PW.10/3, sent a bottle containing pieces
of flash and hairs of the deceased for DNA through
constable Mir Jang to the Laboratory and received
report of KMC in this regard which is Exh.PW.10/5.
He obtained photographs from USB and took the same
into possession through recovery memo Exh.PW.10/7,
produced appellant Imdad ullah before the learned
Judicial Magistrate where he recorded his confessional
statement, whereas statement of appellant Muhammad
Tahir was recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C. He
inserted section 203 PPC against appellant Muhammad
Tahir, obtained blood of parents of the deceased for the
purpose of DNA and sent the same along with parcels
No.3 and 4, containing material of dead body of the
deceased, to Punjab Forensic Science Agency report of
DNA is Exh.PW.10/15-A, recorded statements of the
PWs under section 161 Cr.P.C. and on completion of
investigation handed over case file to the SHO, who
submitted challan against the appellants before the

learned trial Court.
5. On receipt of challan by the learned trial
Court, the appellants were formally charge sheeted to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To
prove its case, the prosecution examined as many as
fifteen witnesses. After closure of the prosecution’s
evidence, statements of the appellants were recorded
under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied the
prosecution allegations and professed their innocence.
They, however, declined to be examined on oath under
section 340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce evidence in
defence. Appellant Imdad Ullah also retracted his
judicial confession. On conclusion of trial, the learned
trial court, after hearing both the sides convicted and
sentenced the appellants as mentioned above.

6. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties advanced at the bar and
with their able assistance perused the record and
evidence available on file.

7. Before adverting to merits of the case, we
deem it appropriate to first decide Cr.Misc.18-P of
2023, filed by appellant Imdad Ullah along with appeal
for condonation of delay in filing appeal. The
impugned judgment has been passed on 09.02.2019,
against which appellant Imdad Ullah has filed appeal
on 12.06.2023 i.e. after a period of more than four

years. It appears from order sheet dated 09.02.2019, of
the learned trial court that after pronouncement of the
judgment, the appellant was handed over copy thereof
on the same day. To this effect signature of appellant
Imdad Ullah was also been obtained on the margin of
order sheet of the said date. In the application, the
appellant has alleged that he being behind the bars was
unable to engage a counsel while none from his family
members is pursuing his case and that he is also
ignorant of law, therefore, he could not file appeal
within the stipulated period of limitation.

8. It is an admitted position — that
Superintendent Jail has not forwarded any appeal on
behalf of appellant Imdad Ullah despite the fact that
appellant being confined in jail was under his
supervision. It was obligation of the Superintendent
concerned Jail to facilitate the appellant in filing
appeal within the prescribed period of limitation as
required under Rule 90 of the Pakistan Prisons Rules,
1894. For ready reference rule (ibid) is reproduced
below:-

“Rule 90. Facilities to prisoners for
filing Appeals:-The Superintendent

shall inform every convicted prisoner,
on first admission to prison, of the
period within which an appeal from the
order under which he has_ been
committed to prison may be filed, if the
prisoner desires to appeal, every facility

shall be given to him for the purpose. A
request for appeal, made with the
period allowed, shall be attended to
forthwith.”

An iota of material is not available on file to show
that appellant Imdad Ullah was informed by the
Superintendent Jail and his desire to file or not to file
appeal against his conviction and sentence has been
obtained. The appellant being prayer leader must not
be acquainted with the legal technicalities and its
consequences. The question of condonation of delay
in filing appeal by a convict beyond the period of
limitation came up before the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case titled, “Muhammad Bakhsh alias
Muhammadi vs the State” (1985 SCMR 72),
wherein delay of 680 days was condoned due to
sentence of life imprisonment and the appeal was
decided on merit. Similarly, in case titled,
“Muhammad Nawaz vs the State” (PLD 2002
Supreme Court 287), the Hon’ble Supreme Court
has condoned the delay of 145 days in filing petition
for leave to appeal by the convict. The worthy
Lahore High Court, Lahore, while dealing with the
controversy of filing appeal by the convict person
beyond the period of limitation in case titled,

“Lehrasab Hussain vs the State” (2011 MLD
1564) has held that:-
“Admittedly, the appellant had been in the
jail for a period of more than nine years
before filing of the appeal. The appeal filed
by his co-convict abated due to his demise.
The Superintendent Jail should have
obtained and forwarded the appeal of the
appellant along with his co-convict as he
was under an obligation to facilitate him in
filing the appeal within limitation as
required under Rule 90 of the Pakistan
Prisons Rules, 1894. The  appellant’s
contention that he remained under bona fide
mistake that it was forwarded and his
relatives had also preferred appeal
constitutes a valid ground for condonation of
delay in the appeal against conviction. The
technicalities should not hamper the court of
justice and the powers regarding
condonation under Section 5 of the
Limitation Act, 1908, should be liberally
exercised to ensure administration of justice
in its true spirit. In this respect reliance is
placed on the case law reported as Mian
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif Vs the State
(PLD 2009 SC 814).

In case titled, “Ali Askar vs the State” (2018 MLD
1608), this court while condoning delay in filing
appeal by the convict, the appeal was heard and

decided on merit.
10

9. Taking guidance and placing reliance on the
judgments (supra), we, while taking into
consideration the long sentence of life imprisonment
awarded to the appellant Imdad Ullah, allow his
application for condonation of delay, resultantly, his
appeal is being decided on merit along with appeal
of appellant Muhammad Tahir.

10. It appears from record that none has furnished
ocular account of the incident. The entire case of the
prosecution’s hinges upon the confessional statement of
the appellant Imdad Ullah and circumstantial evidence
collected during investigation in support thereof. As
per version of complainant on 30.08.2017 at noon
time, his son Muhammad Yasir went missing and on
17.09.2017, he after watching footages of CCTV
Cameras installed at the spot came to know that he
has been abducted by appellant Imdad Ullah, hence,
he submitted a written application/complaint to SHO
Police Station Thall charging therein directly appellant
Imdad Ullah for abduction of Muhammad Yasir.
Undeniably, there is delay of about 17 days in reporting
the matter; however, this shows bana fide of the
complainant that he was not interested in charging
innocent people. Similarly, keeping in view the
customs and traditions of the area to which

the complainant belongs where people in the cases
11

of abduction apprehending death of the abductee,
prefer silence till finding any clue qua whereabouts
of the abductee. Had there been any enmity or ill
will of the complainant with appellant Imdad Ullah,
he could easily charge him on the very first day of
the incident. Record depicts that soon after report of
the complainant, appellant Imdad Ullah along with
co-appellant Muhammad Tahir was arrested at
Chapperi road and on the same day, on the
discovery/pointation of appellant Imdad Ullah, the
dead body of the minor deceased was recovered in
decomposed form from Khadimak Pahar. Appellant
Imdad Ullah also recorded confessional statement
before the learned Judicial Magistrate on
21.09.2017, wherein he while narrating the entire
episode of abduction of the minor deceased from
Thall Bazaar to Khadimak Pahar, confessed
committing his murder in the said Pahar. Though,
during trial, he has retracted his judicial confession,
but it is settled law that conviction of an accused can
be recorded on the basis of retracted judicial
confession, if the same is proved voluntary, true and
corroborated by other strong circumstances of the
case. Mere denial of an accused from his confession
in statement under section 342 Cr.P.C. would not

make his confessional statement inadmissible. In
12

case titled, “Manjeet Singh vs the State” (PLD
2006 Supreme Court 30), it has been held by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court that retracted confessional
statement either judicial or extra judicial, if found
truthful and confidence inspiring as well as qualified
the test of voluntariness can be used for conviction,
without looking for any other sort of corroboration.
The Hon’ble Apex court in the judgment (supra) has
further observed that no rule of criminal
administration of justice existed to the effect that the
court having found the retracted confession
voluntary and true must look for the corroboration
and that in absence of corroborative evidence,
conviction cannot be maintained. Retraction of a
judicial or extra judicial confession itself is not an
infirmity to be considered sufficient to withhold the
conviction, because evidentiary value of a
confession is not to be diminished by the mere fact
that it was retracted by the maker at the trial. Even
an independent corroboration thereof from other
sources direct or circumstantial, cannot be insisted
in every case as a mandatory rule, rather the rule of
corroboration is applied by way of abundant caution
and is a case depending entirely on the confessional
statement of a person or only on the circumstantial

evidence, and this rule is applied more cautiously.
13

11. To determine as to whether the confessional
statement of the appellant Imdad Ullah is voluntary,
true and corroborated by other strong circumstances
of the case? We would like to reproduce his
statement below by translating the same from Urdu
to English and thereafter to dilate upon the evidence
collected and produced by the prosecution in
corroboration thereof:-

“Stated that, I am Pesh Imam in a Mosque of

village, Boland Khel. On 30.08.2017 at 1200 noon,
I picked Muhammad Yasir deceased from shop of
his father Alam Jan, situated in Israfeel Market
Thall Bazaar and took him to the shop of one
Naveed, situated in Mir Khabi Thull. There my
co-villager Muhammad Tahir was present in a
room, situated adjacent to the shop of Naveed. I
along with Muhammad Yasir deceased stayed in
the said room with Muhammad Tahir. I demanded
from him his motorbike bearing registration
No.F.1348-Hangu, but he told me that the
motorbike has been taken by shopkeeper Naveed
to Thull Bazaar. After sometime, shopkeeper
Naveed returned, parked the motorbike and handed
over its key to Muhamamd Tahir. Shopkeer Naved
after some conversation with us left the room. I
then took key of motorbike from Muhammad Tahir
and told him that I am going to commit murder of
Muhammad Yasir deceased, as his father Alam Jan

and uncle Muhammad Umar have blamed me for
14

keeping illicit relation with boys, as a result, I am
being removed from the position of Pesh Imam.
Before, I had tried to kill Muhammad Umar and
Alam Jan, uncle and father of Muhammad Yasir
deceased, but remained unsuccessful. After that I
along with Muhammad Yasir left the shop and
reached Khadimak Pahar on motorbike. I parked
the motorcycle in the bottom of hill and took
Muhammad Yasir up to the hill where I sit him in a
ditch and placed big stones on his body from legs
upto his head. I then return on the motorbike to the
room of Muhammad Tahir. After taking meal with
him and Naveed, at assar time I re-visited the
crime spot and noticed that minor Muhammad
Yasir has died. This is my statement”.

12. It is manifest from record that on arrest of
the appellant Imdad Ullah on 17.09.2017, Mohib
Ullah SI (PW.9), on his pointation has recovered the
dead body of deceased from Khadimak phar, lying
under the stones vide pointation memo Exh.PC/2, in
presence of PWs Badshah Zar and Muhammad
Ayaz. Badshah Zar while appearing as PW.3 has
deposed that he accompanied Mohib Ullah SI
accompanied to Khadimak Ghar where on the
pointation of appellant Imdad Ullah the dead body
of Muhammad Yasir deceased lying under the
stones, was recovered. To this effect pointation

memo Exh.PC/2 was prepared by the SHO which
15

correct bears my signature. Similar is testimony of
Abdul Rehman SI, the investigating Officer (PW.10)
of the case, who has deposed that he was
telephonically informed by SHO on which he
reached Khadimak Hill and in his presence the dead
body of the deceased was recovered on the
pointation of the appellant Imdad Ullah. He
prepared injury sheet and inquest report of the
deceased and shifted his dead body to the hospital
for post mortem examination. Youaf Khan ASI
(PW.1) is another witness of the pointation memo
who has testified in line with the above named PWs
by stating that the dead body of the deceased was
recovered on the pointation of the appellant Imdad
Ullah in his presence.

13. Naveed Ahmad while appearing as PW.4
deposed that on 30.08.2017 at about noon time, he
was present in his shop when appellant Mohammad
Tahir came there. He took key of motorbike from
him and proceeded to Thall bazaar; that on his return
after 15/20 minutes he saw appellant Imdad Ullah
along with Mohammad Yasir in a room adjacent to
his shop with appellant Mohammad Tahir; that
appellant Imdad Ullah took key of motorcycle from
Muhammad Tahir and took Muhammad Yasir

deceased along with him on the motorbike; that after
16

1 % hour, appellant Imdad Ullah returned alone on
the motorcycle; thereafter we all took meal and
departed from each other.

14. Record divulges that the motorcycle bearing
registration No.1248 used in the commission of
offence has also been taken into possession and duly
exhibited during trial. Momin Khan (PW.7) has
identified the dead body of the deceased boy.

15. Azam Shah, owner of Israfeel Market has
been examined as PW.13. He has deposed that he is
owner of Israfeel Market situated in Bannu Chowk
Thall bazaar; that he had installed CCTV Cameras
in the market at different places for security
measures; that he has handed over record of CCTV
footage of 30.08.2017 to Alam Jan complainant in
which the accused Imdad Ullah and deceased can
been seen together. Amazingly, this witness has not
been cross-examined by the defence meaning
thereby that his testimony remained unchallenged.
All the footages of the CCTV cameras have been
taken into possession by the I.O. and exhibited
during trial.

16. The above discussed oral and circumstantial
evidence fully corroborate the confessional
statement of appellant Imdad Ullah. Similarly, the

testimony of Dr. Imran Khan (PW.2), who has
17

conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased
also support the confessional statement of the
appellant. He while appearing in the witness box
has stated that the dead body of the deceased was
fully decomposed and there was deep fracture on his
frontal skull. He opined the probable time between
death and postmortem as 15-20 days, meaning
thereby that the occurrence has taken place in
between 30.08.2027 and 17.09.2017. The
prosecution witnesses have been subjected to
lengthy and taxing cross examination but defence
failed to create any dent in their testimony.

17. Syed Mansoor Shah Bukhari, Judicial
Magistrate Hangu, who has recorded confessional
statement of the appellant while appearing as PW.11
deposed that on 21.09.2017 at 01.00 PM, Abdul
Rehman SI, produced appellant Imdad Ullah before
him for recording his confessional statement. After
observing all legal formalities and providing
sufficient time to him for pondering over on his
statement, he recorded his statement Exh.PW.11/2.
The memorandum of inquiry is Exh.W.11/1 and
certificate is Exh.PW.11/3. This witness has also
been subjected to lengthy cross-examination by the
defence but nothing of the sort that the confessional

statement of the appellant was involuntary and result
18

of torture, coercion or inducement could be
extracted from his mouth.

18. For what has been discussed above, we are
firm in our view to hold that confessional statement
of the appellant Imdad Ullah is voluntary, true and
free from any force and inducement and is
corroborated by strong oral, circumstantial and
medical evidence. The learned trial Court while
appreciating the prosecution evidence and the
confessional statement of the appellant Imdad Ullah
has arrived at a right conclusion by holding him
guilty of the offence to which no exception can be
taken.

19. So far as the findings of the learned trial
court with regard to guilt of appellant Muhammad
Tahir are concerned, the same are not based on
proper appreciation of evidence. Except a single
circumstance that his motorcycle was used by
appellant Imdad Ullah for taking the deceased to the
spot, no other evidence, much less concrete has been
brought on record to prove his nexus with appellant
Imdad Ullah in the commission of offence. The
prosecution has failed to prove his mens rea and
actus reus in the commission of offence to his role,

hence, findings of the learned trial court to the
19

extent of his conviction are not sustainable in the
eye of law.

20. Now the moot question is what should the
quantum of sentence to be awarded to the appellant
Imdad Ullah, so as to meet the ends of justice. We
have observed certain inconsistencies of minor
dimension in the prosecution evidence which though
are not so fatal to warrant acquittal of the accused,
however, the same can be taken as mitigating
circumstance in the matter of sentence in light of
ratio of judgment in case titled, “Falak Sher vs the

State” (NLR 2000 Criminal 188 Supreme Court),
wherein it has been held that:-

“In the overall circumstances of the case,
where motive has become suspect and where
the prosecution version suffers from
inconsistencies other than of a fatal character,
it appears proper not to resort to the death
penalty, touching the guilt of the accused. For
such reasons the appeal is partly allowed
converting the capital punishment awarded
by the High court, into life imprisonment
coupled with fine and identical provisions, as
to distribution of compensation under section
544-A Cr.P.C. returned by the trial court
together with the benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C. of the same code”.

Reliance in this regard can also be placed on 1980
SCMR 859 and 1993 SCMR 1660. In the case of
Israr Ali vs. The State reported in 2007 SCMR 525,

it has been ruled by the Hon’bble bench that
20

question of sentence demands utmost care on part of
the Court dealing with life and liberties of people
and that accused person(s) is/are also entitled to
extenuating benefit of doubt on the question of
sentence. Again, in the case of Muhammad Riaz and
another vs the State and another reported in 2007
SCMR 1413, it was observed by the Hon’able
Supreme Court that no doubt, normal penalty for an
act of commission of Qatl-i-Amd provided under
law is death, but since life imprisonment also being
a legal sentence for such offence must be kept in
mind wherever the facts and circumstances warrant
mitigation of sentence, because no hard and fast rule
can be applied in each and every case.

21. Accordingly, appeal filed by appellant
Imdad Ullah being meritless is hereby dismissed,
resultantly, his conviction and sentences recorded by
the learned trial court vide judgment dated
09.02.2019 are maintained.

22. Connected Cr.A. No.207-P of 2019, filed by
appellant Muhammad Tahir is _ allowed,
consequently, his conviction and sentences recorded
by the learned trial court vide judgment dated
09.02.2019 are hereby set aside and he is acquitted

from the charge leveled against him in this case. He
21

be set at liberty forthwith, if not confined in any
other case.

23. On acquittal of appellant Muhammad Tahir
and maintaining the conviction and sentences of the
convict Imdad Ullah, connected Cr.R. No.33-P of
2019, stands dismissed.
