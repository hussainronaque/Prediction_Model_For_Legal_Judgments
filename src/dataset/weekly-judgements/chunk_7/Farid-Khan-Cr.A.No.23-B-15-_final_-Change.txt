2. Feeling dis-satisfied with the judgment dated

3. Appellant Farid Khan also faced trial in case FIR

No.165 dated 25.5.1994 registered under Sections 302/324/353

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC was extended to

him.

Both the sentences were ordered to run

consecutively ”.

4. Against this judgment of conviction and sentence

dated 04.8.1997, the appellant filed J.Cr.A.No.24-B/2015. Since

Imran/*
both the matters are interconnected and for the following reasons,

both the appeals ie. Cr.A.No.23-B/2015 and J.Cr.A.No.24-

B/2015 are being disposed of through this single judgment.

5. On 23.5.1994 at 1730 hours, complainant

Saifullah Khan (PW-3) made report to PW-9 Dost Muhammad

Khan SHO on the spot that on the eventful day he alongwith his

son Sultan Khan were present in the baithak (chowk) of village.

One Aziz-ur-Rahman, partner and working as mistry with his son

at D.I.Khan, came there at ‘pashin gaza vela’ and sat alongwith

his son on a cot. The complainant went to the house and brought

tea when in the meanwhile appellant Farid Khan armed with

Kalashnikov and co-accused Zahoor Khan (empty handed) came

there and sat near to them on cot. The complainant offered them

tea, the appellant did not accept while co-accused Zahoor Khan

after taking tea, shook hand with them and left. Having covering

few paces, the appellant suddenly returned and started firing with

his Kalashnikov on Aziz-ur-Rahman. As a result, Aziz-ur-

Rahman and his son Sultan Khan got hit and died on the spot.

After the occurrence both the accused ran away. The occurrence

was stated to be witnessed by co-villagers. On the report of the

Imran/*
complainant murasila (Ex.PA/1) was drafted and sent to the

Police Station. Hence, FIR No.164 dated 23.5.1994 under

Sections 302/34 PPC was registered at Police Station Ghoriwala,

Bannu.

6. In connection with case FIR No.223 dated

03.7.1993 under Sections 302/324/34 PPC Police Station

Ghoriwala, Bannu and case FIR No.164 dated 23.5.1994 under

Sections 302/34 PPC of same Police Station, the local police

received information regarding presence of appellant in his

house. Meharban Khan ASI (PW-7) alongwith Muhammad Iqbal

IHC No.903, Salim Khan HC No.1140, Rustam LHC No.792

(PW-8), Naqibullah No.104, Naeemullah No.38, Sher Ali Shah

No.1159, Umar Ayaz No.1158 (PW-9), Nasrullah No.879,

Sarwar Jan No.246 and Gullom No.832 armed with

Kalashnikovs cordoned off the house of the appellant.

Complainant Meharban Khan ASI, Muhammad Iqbal IHC

No.903, Naqibullah No.104 and Umar Ayaz No.1158 entered the

house. The appellant armed with Kalashnikov came out of his

residential room and started firing with intention to kill the police

party. As a result, Muhammad Iqbal IHC No.903 and Nagibullah

Imran/*
No.104 got hit and fell on the ground while complainant and

Constable Umar Ayaz escaped unhurt. The police party also

retaliated the firing but the appellant escaped and disappeared in

‘abadi’. Nagibullah FC No.104 died on the spot while

Muhammad Iqbal No.903 was shifted to the hospital in injured

condition where later on he also succumbed to his injuries.

Murasila (Ex.PA/1) was drafted and sent to the police station.

Hence, case FIR No.165 dated 25.5.1994 under Sections

302/324/353 PPC was registered at Police Station Ghoriwala,

Bannu.

7. After completion of investigation, in case FIR

No.164 challan was submitted against the appellant and co-

accused Zahoor Khan before the learned trial Court and the trial

culminated into acquittal of co-accused Zahoor Khan and

conviction of the present appellant, who was sentenced as above,

vide judgment dated 02.9.1999.

8. Similarly, on completion of investigation, in case

FIR No.165, challan was submitted against the appellant before

the learned trial Court and on conclusion of trial he was

Imran/*
convicted and sentenced as mentioned above vide judgment

dated 04.8.1997.

9. At the very outset, when learned counsel for the

appellant was confronted with the situation that both the appeals

having been filed on 25.02.2015 challenging the judgments dated

02.9.1999 and 04.8.1997, are hopelessly time barred and the

delay has not been properly explained, he frankly conceded that

he would not press the appeal on merits but requested that the

sentences awarded to the appellant may be ordered to run

concurrently as required under section 35 read with section 397

Cr.P.C. The learned Addl: A.G. for the State assisted by private

counsel for the complainant half-heartedly refuted the arguments

of learned counsel for the appellant.

10. As the learned counsel for the appellant did not

press the appeals on merits, therefore, we will refrain from

discussing merits of the case. The record reveals that while

pronouncing conviction and sentences of the appellant in both

the cases, the learned trial Court has ordered that all the

sentences shall run consecutively. In this respect the apex Court

Imran/*
in case titled “Shah Hussain Vs. The State” reported as (PLD

2009 Supreme Court 460), held that:-

“A perusal of proviso (a) to subsection (2) of
section 35, Cr.PC., indicates that it prohibits
the giving of consecutive sentence in one trial
beyond the period of fourteen years, the
maximum sentence, short of the death
sentence, which could be imposed on an
offender before the promulgation of the Law
Reforms Ordinance, 1972. The said provision
(section 35, Cr.PC) appears to be in
consonance with the scheme and intendment
of the Pakistan Penal Code that an offender
Should only suffer the maximum sentence of
imprisonment for any heinous crime (as it
stood until 1972) which should not exceed
fourteen years. Therefore, the imposition of
the sentence of life imprisonment (which
means 25 years’ R.I., plus seven years’ R.I.
under section 307, PPC would be inconsistent
with the intendment of the provisions of
proviso (a) to subsection (2) of section 35,
Cr.PC, inasmuch as the maximum punishment
prescribed for heinous offences shall be
exceeded. The difficulty in this case can be
overcome if the sentences awarded to the
appellant in respect of the two convictions
under section 302, PPC and under section 307,
PPC in one and the same trial are directed to
run concurrently instead of running

consecutively”.

Imran/*
11. Likewise, Section 397 of the Criminal Procedure

Code, 1898 provides that:

“When a person already undergoing a
sentence of imprisonment or
imprisonment for life is sentenced to
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life,
such imprisonment, or imprisonment for
life shall commence at the expiration of
the imprisonment, or imprisonment for
life to which he has been previously
sentenced, unless the Court directs that
the subsequent sentence shall run
concurrently with such previous

sentence.”

12. In this respect the Apex Court in case titled,

“Mst. Shahista Bibi and another Vs. Superintendent Central

Jail, Mach and 2 others” reported as PLD 2015 Supreme

Court 15, held that:

“Besides the provisions of section 35,
Cr.P.C. the provisions of section 397,
Cr.P.C. altogether provide entirely a
different proposition widening the scope
of discretion of the Court to direct that
sentences of imprisonment or that of life
imprisonment awarded at the same trial

or at two different trials but successively,

Imran/*
Imran/*

Shall run concurrently. Once the
Legislation has conferred the above
discretion in the Court then in hardship
cases, Courts are required to seriously
take into consideration the same to the
benefit of the accused so that to minimize
and liquidate the hardship treatment, the
accused person is to get and to liquidate
the same as far as possible. In a situation
like the present one, the Court of law
cannot fold up its hands to deny the
benefit of the said beneficial provision to
an accused person because denial in
such a case would amount to a ruthless
treatment to him/her and he/she would
certainly die while undergoing such long
imprisonment in prison. Thus, the
benefit conferred upon the appellant/
appellants through amnesty given by the
Government, if the benefit of directing
the sentences to run concurrently is
denied to him/them, would brought at
naught and ultimately the object of the
same would be squarely defeated and
that too, under the circumstances when
the provision of S.397, Cr.P.C. confers
wide discretion on the Court and
unfettered one to extend such benefit to
the accused in a case of peculiar nature
like the present one. Thus, construing
the beneficial provision in favour of the
accused would clearly meet the ends of

justice and interpreting the same to the
10

contrary would certainly defeat the

same”.

In this regard reliance is also placed on case

titled, “Ali Fouzan Vs. The State and others” reported in 2013 P

Cr.LJ 652.

13. For what has been discussed above, both the

appeals are dismissed. However, it is held that all the sentences

awarded to appellant Farid Khan in case FIR 164 and FIR

No.165 are to run concurrently. Office is directed to send a copy

of this judgment immediately to the Superintendent Jail, Bannu,

who is directed to do the needful at his end, in accordance with

law.
