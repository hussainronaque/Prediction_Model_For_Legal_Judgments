ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-Petitioners

1. Ikhtiar 2. Kashif and 3. Gul Muhammad, seek bail in

case FIR No.274 dated 16.08.2014, registered under

sections 302/324/34 PPC, in Police Station Regi wherein

they alongwith absconding co-accused Imtiaz are charged

for committing the murder of Nishad Khan on 16.08.2014

at 15.30 hours inside the Baithak of complainant Taza

Khan, with firearms.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. Admittedly, the role of firing at the deceased has

been specifically attributed to absconding to-accused

Imtiaz. The only role attributed to present petitioners is that

they while aiming their weapons at the complainant

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

warned him not to move, and later on, when the
complainant tried to apprehend absconding co-accused
Imtiaz after murder of his son, the petitioners opened fire
at the complainant, but it proved in effective. On tentative
assessment of the material the petitioners have not actively
participated in the murder of the deceased, therefore, their
common intention with the principal absconding
co-accused as well as their intention to kill the complainant
who was at their mercy is yet to be determined during trial
after recording evidence, which makes the case of the
petitioners arguable for the purpose of bail. It is settled
law that bail may not be refused merely on the ground that
accused are directly charged in the F.I.R for a heinous
offence, when otherwise, they are found entitled to the
concession of bail because mistaken relief of bail, can be
repaired by convicting the accused, if proved guilty at the
trial, but no proper reparation can be offered for their
unjustified incarceration, albeit, their acquittal in the long
run. As on merits, case of bail has been made out,

therefore, mere absconsion of the petitioners cannot be a

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

ground for refusal of bail in light of ratio of judgment
of the Apex Court in case titled, “Mitho Pitafi Vs The
State” 2009S CM R 299.

4. For the reasons discussed above, this petition
is allowed. Accused/petitioners are admitted to bail
provided each one of them furnishes bail bonds in the sum
of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and resourceful
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD concerned.
