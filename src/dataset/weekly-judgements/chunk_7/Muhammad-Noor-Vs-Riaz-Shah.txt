JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANT, J.- At a trial held

by learned Additional Sessions Judge-V, Kohat, appellant

Muhammad Noor having been found guilty of murder and

attempt to commit murder, vide judgment dated 17.05.2012,

was convicted and sentenced under section 302 (b) PPC to

undergo life imprisonment and to pay Rs.1,00,000/-, as

compensation to LRs of deceased, in terms of S.544-A Cr.P.C.

or in default thereof to undergo 01 year S.I. more and under

section 324 PPC to suffer 10 years R.I. Both the sentences

have been directed to run concurrently and benefit of S.382-B

Cr.P.C. has been extended to him.

2. Appellant-convict has questioned his conviction and

sentences through the instant appeal, while Riaz Shah

petitioner/complainant by way of conmected§= Cr.R.

No.81-P/2012, is seeking enhancement of sentence of the

convict from life imprisonment to normal penalty of death. As

both are stemming out from one and the same judgment of

the learned Trial Court dated 17.05.2012, therefore, are to be

disposed of through this common judgment.

3. The epitome of the prosecution case is that on

27.02.205 at 2115 hours, complainant Riaz Shah (PW.6), in

company of dead body of Zahir Shah, reported to local police in

emergency of LMH, Kohat that on the fateful day, he alongwith

the deceased was on the way to the mosque of Mohallah

Nandar Khel to offer "Maghrib prayer” and when reached

near Government Girls Middle School Dhoda Sharif, Muhammad

Noor (appellant-convict herein) alongwith Raza Khan and

Farman absconding co-accused, duly armed with Kalashnikovs

emerged there; that on command of accused Raza Khan,

appellant and absconding co-accused Farman, opened fire at

them with intention to do them away, resultantly, deceased got

hit and died on the spot while he luckily remained unscathed.

An oral altercation little before the incident has been alleged as

cause behind the incident.

4. Shaukat Salim SHO (PW.7) incorporated the

report of complainant into murasila Exh.PA/1 and sent the

same to Police Station, on the basis of which FIR No.159 dated

27.02.2005 under sections 302/324/109/34 PPC, was

registered in Police Station Saddar, Kohat. He prepared injury

sheet and inquest report Exh.PW.7/1 and Exh.PW.7/2 of the

deceased and referred his dead body to the mortuary for

post-mortem examination.

5. Dr. Ghulam Qadir (PW.4) conducted autopsy on the

dead body of the deceased on 27.02.2005 at 08.30 p.m. and

found the following injuries on his person:-

1. Firearm entry wound size V4 x % inch on medial of
right elbow joint.

forearm size V2 x Y2 inch.

12. Firearm exit wound on the later side of right upper

13. Firearm exit wound on the lower lateral side of right

Opinion: According to opinion of the Medical Officer, death of

the deceased occurred due to injuries to his vital organs like

heart, pleurae and liver as a result of firearm injuries. Probable

time between death and injury has been observed by him as

“Instantaneous” while between death and postmortem as “0-3

hours”.

6. Abdul Latif SI (PW.10), proceeded to the spot and

during spot inspection, secured bloodstained earth from the

place of deceased as well as 09 empties of 7.62 bore from the

places of the accused. He also took into possession the last

worn bloodstained garments of the deceased Vide recovery

memo Exh.PC/1, recorded statements of the PWs under

section 161 Cr.P.C. and sent the bloodstained articles to the

FSL. On next day of the incident, Muhammad Hussain Khan SI

(PW.11) prepared site plan Exh.PW.11/1 on the pointation of

complainant, placed on file postmortem report of the deceased,

recorded statements of the witnesses, initiated proceedings

under sections 204 and 87 Cr.P.C., placed on file FSL report

Exh.PZ qua the bloodstained articles and on completion of

investigation handed over case file to SHO Jehangir Khan, who

submitted challan in terms of S.512 Cr.P.C. against the

accused.

7. After arrest of the appellant by Shah Duran SHO

vide arrest card Exh.PW.1/1 and completion of necessary

investigation, challan was submitted against him before the

learned Trial Court, where he was formally charge sheeted to

which he pleaded not guilty and claimed Trial. To bring home

the guilt of appellant, prosecution examined as many as eleven

witnesses. After closure of the prosecution evidence, statement

of the appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.,

wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and professed

his innocence. He, however, neither wished to be examined on

oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor opted to produce

evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, learned Trial Court,

after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the

appellant as mentioned above.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant-convict argued

that appellant is innocent and has been implicated falsely by

complainant on mere suspicions; that the occurrence is unseen

while complainant being nephew of the deceased is procured

witness, who miserably failed to establish his presence on the

spot at the time of incident through some _ physical

circumstances that’s why the incident has been reported with

three hours delay, after due deliberation consultation and

preliminary investigation; that medical evidence totally negates

the ocular account; that charge has been exaggerated as

according to medical evidence, the incident seems to be the

doing of single person; that appellant has not confessed his

guilt before any competent court of law nor anything

incriminating to connect him with the offence has been

recovered either from his direct or indirect possession; that the

alleged crime empties have not been sent to the FSL for

analysis; that in absence of direct confidence inspiring

evidence, mere recovery of crime empties, blood from the spot,

bloodstained clothes of the deceased coupled with positive

Serologist report, being corroborative pieces of evidence would

not be sufficient to prove the guilt of appellant; that similarly,

conviction cannot be sustained on abscondance of accused

alone which is only a suspicious circumstance having no value

by itself in absence of direct evidence; that prosecution

evidence is suffering from material contradictions and

discrepancies creating doubts in the mode and manner of the

incident, benefit of which should have been extended to the

appellant not as a matter of grace but as matter of right by

the learned Trial Court, therefore, the impugned judgment

being based on surmises and conjectures is liable to be

reversed.

9. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant contended that appellant has been

charged directly alongwith his absconding co-accused for

committing the murder of the deceased; that ocular account

furnished by complainant being straightforward, confidence

inspiring and supported by medical evidence and recoveries

from the spot, has rightly been believed by the learned Trial

Court; that defence failed to shatter the testimony of

complainant; that in presence of direct evidence of the

complainant, mere non-sending of empties to the FSL, would

not damage the prosecution case; that soon after the incident

appellant went into hiding and remained fugitive from law for

noticeable period for which no explanation, much less

plausible, has been furnished by him, which is another

corroborative piece of evidence proving his guilty conscious;

that prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellant through

cogent and confidence inspiring ocular evidence supported by

corroborative pieces of evidence as well as medical evidence,

therefore, the learned Trial Court was justified by holding him

guilty of the offence. They contended that when the guilt of

the appellant was proved and there was no mitigating

circumstance, the learned Trial Court ought to have awarded

him maximum penalty of death. They sought dismissal of the

appeal and requested for enhancement of sentence of the

convict.

10. We have considered the respective submissions

of learned counsel for the parties and learned AAG for the

State. Record perused with their able assistance.

11. According to complainant Riaz Shah (PW.6), the

occurrence took place near GGMS, Dhoda Sharif at 1815 hours,

on a thoroughfare which has been reported by him on the

same day at 2115 hours in LMH, Kohat i.e. after a delay of

three hours. Non-availability of transport on the spot has been

advanced a cause of the delay in lodging report, but in cross-

examination complainant admits that vegetables supply to

entire Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from village Dhoda Sharif via

transport and a proper road leads to Kohat from the village.

This admission of complainant squarely proves availability of

transport in the said village, therefore, his explanation qua

delay in reporting the incident after long three hours does not

appeal to a prudent mind. The lying of dead body on the spot

for more than two hours, when the house of complainant is

10

situated in little distance of 10 minutes walk, is beyond our

comprehension as in such eventualities he could have shifted

the dead body to the house and after arranging the vehicle

could shift to the hospital. In view of the above, we are firm in

our view that the time of three hours has been consumed in

procuring the presence of complainant and deliberation and

consultation to charge accused after thought. Guidance in this

regard can be derived from case titled, “Mehmood Ahmad

and 3 others Vs the State and another” (1995 SCMR

127). Moreso, time of report as alleged by the complainant is

09.15 p.m. whereafter Medical Officer conducted autopsy on

the dead body of the deceased. In cross-examination,

complainant categorically stated that it was about 8.30 p.m.

when the dead body of the deceased was being shifted to the

hospital from the spot and that they reached hospital within

thirty or thirty five minutes, but postmortem report of the

deceased speaks otherwise wherein the time of examination of

dead body of the deceased has been given as 08.30 p.m.

Dr. Ghulam Qadir (PW.4) deposed that he conducted autopsy

on the dead body of the deceased at 08.30 p.m. which comes

11

to be about 45 minutes prior to time of report, negating the

time of report alleged by complainant. We are confronted with

two contradictory versions about time of report, one furnished

by complainant, and the other by Medical Officer. However,

version of complainant is unbelievable because if the dead

body of the deceased was on the spot at 8.30 p.m, how the

Medical Officer was able to conduct autopsy. Rather the

peculiar facts and circumstances of the case suggest that the

dead body of the deceased had already been shifted to the

hospital by the people in absence of complainant and after

preliminary investigation and postmortem report, complainant

was procured and introduced as an eyewitness and lodger of

report, as the incident has not been reported directly in Police

Station in shape of FIR, rather in the shape of murasila and it

has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,

“Muhammad Asif Vs the State” (2008 SCMR 1001) that

FIRs, which are not recorded at Police Station, suffer from the

inherent presumption that same were recorded after due

deliberation.

12

12. The oral altercation between the parties prior to

incident remained unproved. No shred of evidence whatsoever

has been led to prove as to where and in whose presence the

said altercation took place and what was the bone of

contention of said altercation. It is settled law that where the

motive remains unproved, then the ocular account would be

considered with great care and caution. Complainant Riaz

Shah, no doubt appeared as solitary witness, who happens to

be the first cousin of the deceased. No doubt, conviction can

be recorded on the basis of solitary statement of a witness

having close relation with the deceased or victim provided the

same is trustworthy, confidence inspiring and corroborated by

strong circumstances of the case. Besides, an eyewitness who

claimed his presence at the spot, to make his testimony

believable and reliable, must satisfy the mind of the court

through some physical circumstances or through some

corroborative evidence about his presence at the spot.

13. PW Riaz Shah posing himself to be the eyewitness

of the occurrence has been shown in the site plan at point No.2

in close proximity of 5 paces from the deceased. Two accused

13

including the appellant have been attributed the role of firing at

the deceased and complainant with automatic weapons i.e.

Kalashnikovs, which eject number of shots in seconds. It is not

the case of complainant that he was not fired at by the

accused rather he also charged the accused for attempting at

his life, in the circumstances, much damage should have been

caused to him, being in close proximity of the accused at a

distance of 7/8 paces and squarely at their mercy. His escape

or let off by the assailant, keeping in view the norms of

criminals of the society, where in such eventualities such like

witnesses are never spared due to risk of leaving evidence

behind the crime as well as apprehension of revenge by such

witness in future. This aspect of the prosecution case coupled

with the above discussed aspects; create serious doubts about

presence of the complainant on the spot with the deceased at

the time of incident. Had he been present, damage to him at

the hands of assailant/assailants was natural. He has not

showed his hands or clothes smeared with the blood of the

deceased because it would be against a natural human conduct

that someone real cousin will be lying on the spot dead and he

14

would not even bother to touch him. The normal human

conduct in such eventualities would definitely be to take his

beloved in lap. No witness, much less independent has been

examined to prove presence of complainant with the deceased

at the relevant time, therefore, his testimony, which otherwise,

is suffering from material contradictions and discrepancies has

wrongly been believed and relied upon by the learned Trial

Court.

14. As regard medical evidence, the same totally

negates the ocular account. Dr. Ghulam Qadir PW.4 in cross

examination deposed that dimension of all entrance wounds on

the person of the deceased was one and the same except

wound No.7, which is blunt injury. Complainant has never

stated about infliction of any blunt injury on the person of the

deceased. Besides, same dimension of all entrance wounds

reflects the incidents to be the doing of single person in

absence of FSL report qua the recovered empties of 7.62 bore

which have not been sent to the FSL for analysis to determine

as to whether these had been fired from one or more than one

weapon. This aspect of the case, also create doubt in the

15

prosecution case that the occurrence has not taken place in the

mode and manner as alleged by the complainant.

15. Mere recovery of blood from the spot, bloodstained

last worn garments of the deceased coupled with positive

Serologist report and recovery of empties from the spot, in

absence of direct evidence, would not be sufficient to sustain

conviction of accused in capital charge. Such recoveries are

always considered as corroborative pieces of evidence, which

are always taken into consideration alongwith direct evidence

and not in isolation.

16. No doubt, proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C.

were initiated and completed against the appellant, however,

he has denied his abscondence in his statement under section

342 Cr.P.C. It is settled law that abscondence alone, cannot

be a substitute of real evidence. It has been observed by the

apex Court in Farman Ali and others’ case (PLD 1980 SC

201) that abscondence by itself would be of no avail to

prosecution in absence of any other evidence against the

absconding accused. Mere abscondence of accused would not

be enough to sustain his conviction. Reliance can also be

16

placed on case titled, “Muhammad Vs Pesham Khan

(1986 SCMR 823).

17. For the forgoing reasons, we are of the firm view

that prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt of

appellant through cogent and confidence inspiring evidence

beyond shadow of doubt. The prosecution evidence is pregnant

with doubts and according to golden principle of benefit of

doubt one substantial doubt would be enough for acquittal of

the accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is essentially a rule

of prudence, which cannot be ignored while dispensing justice

in accordance with law. Conviction must be based on

unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and any doubt

arising in the prosecution case, must be resolved in favour of

the accused. The said rule is based on the maxim “ it is better

that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent

person be convicted” which occupied a pivotal place in the

Islamic Law and is enforced strictly in view of the saying of the

Holy Prophet (PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in

releasing a criminal is better than his mistake in punishing an

innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be derived from the

17

judgments of the apex court in case titled, "Muhammad
Khan and another Vs the State” (1999 SCMR 1220) and
case titled, ‘Muhammad Ikram Vs the State” (2009
SCMR 230).. The learned trial Court has not evaluated the
evidence in its true perspective and thus reached to an
erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant guilty of the
offence. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed. Convection and
sentences of the appellant are set aside and he is acquitted of
the charges leveled against him. He be set at liberty forthwith,
if not required in any other case.

18. On acquittal of the appellant/convict, connected
Cr.R. No.81-P/2012, titled, “Riaz Shah Vs Muhammad Noor etc”
has become infructuous, which stands dismissed as such.
These are the reasons for our short order of even date.

Copy of this judgment be sent to the then
learned Trial Judge, for future guidance.

Announced.
