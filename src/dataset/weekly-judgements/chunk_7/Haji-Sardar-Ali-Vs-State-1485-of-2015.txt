ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Haji Sardar Ali, seeks bail in case FIR No.230 dated
14.03.2015, registered under section 489-F PPC, in Police
Station City Mardan.

2. Allegations against the petitioner are that in
connection with a joint business he handed over a cheque
No.347323203 dated 11.12.2014 to complainant Yar
Muhammad in respect of an amount of Rs.50,00,000/-
(fifty lacs) outstanding against him in connection with a
joint business, which on presentation before Bank Alfalah
Mardan road, was dishonoured to du insufficient amount in
the account of the petitioner, hence, this case.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Petitioner is charged for issuance of Cheque,
which has allegedly been dishonoured on presentation

before the concerned Bank. Admittedly, punishment

provided for the offence under section 489-F PPC
imprisonment for three years or fine or both. The gravity of
the offence how high so ever may be and whatever type of
transaction is involved, but in no case, the punishment may
be greater than the one provided under the Statue, rather it
can be lesser than the one provided in the Statue in case of
leniency of the Court in light of the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case. The scheme of Section 497
Cr.P.C. is to release an accused on bail if his case does not
fall within the Prohibitory Clause of S.497 Cr.P.C. as in
such like cases bail is a rule and refusal thereof an
exception. Above all, punishment provided for the offence
under section 489-F PPC, is imprisonment for three years
or fine or both and it is settled law that when two types of
sentences are provided for an offence then the lesser
punishment is to be considered by the Courts for the
purposes of bail. In the circumstances, offence under
section 489-F PPC not only does not fall within the
Prohibitory limb of Section 497 Cr.P.C., but is deemed to
be bailable when only the sentence of fine is taken into
consideration. In case, titled, “Riaz Jaffar Natiq Vs
Muhammad Nadeem Dar and others” 2011 S C M R,
1708, the august Apex Court by following the principles

laid down in case titled, “Zafar Iqbal Vs Muhammad

Anwar and others” ( 2009 SCMR 1488), granted bail to
the accused on the ground of not falling the punishment of
the offence within the Prohibitory Clause of Section 497
Cr.P.C. and in that case a Cheque of rupees twenty
Millions was dishonoured,

3. Deriving wisdom from the judgments of the
Apex Court (Supra), I allow this petition and release the
petitioner on bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the
sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and
resourceful sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD
concerned.
