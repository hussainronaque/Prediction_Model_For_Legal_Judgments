IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT,
MINGORA BENCH (DAR-UL-QAZA), SWAT
(Judicial Department)

Cr.M B.A. No. 199-M/2017.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 24.5.2017.

Petitioner:- (Inamullah) by Oazi Farid Ahmad
Advocate.

Respondents:- (the State & I another) by Mr.
Rafig Ahmad, Astt: Advocate General and Mr.

Rashid Ali Khan, Advocate.

MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.- By his order

dated 21.04.2017, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi-III Swat rejected
the bail petition for the detailed reasons
mentioned therein in Cr.M B.A. No. 163/4 of
the year 2017 arising out of case FIR No. 301
dated 21.03.2017 for the offences covered under
sections 489-F, 420 PPC registered at Police

Station Mingora District Swat.

2. This is an attempt for the grant of
bail under the grounds taken in the missive of

petition with the following outlook:-
Nawab

"It is therefore, humbly prayed, by

accepting the instant bail petition the

accused may kindly be released on bail.

Any other relief whatsoever be awarded to

Petitioner if this august Court deems fit

otherwise."
3. Qasim Khan came up with his
report that after a cheque bearing No. 25978998
dated 03.03.2017 was dishonored from the
respective Bank, in order to lodge an FIR the
matter was registered through Mad No. 23 of
the daily diary dated 17.03.2017. It pertains to
fraud committed upon him for an amount of
Rs. 9,40,000/- given for purchase of golden
ornaments. When were not delivered, for the
return of said amount a cheque was furnished.
By this act the Petitioner is trying to digest
handsome amount, who shall be brought to

justice.

4. Having heard arguments of the
learned counsel for the Petitioner, learned

counsel for the complainant and learned A.A.G
Nawab

for the State, record with their assistance gone

through.

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

relied on PLJ 2016 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 617 "
Haji Sardar _Ali_vs_ Yar _ Muhammad_and
others", 2014 P Cr. LJ 1060 (Peshawar) "
Muhammad _Igqbal_Khan_ys_the State and
another", 2011 SCMR_ 1708 " Riaz Jafar
Natig vs Muhammad Nadeem Dar and others"
and 2014 YLR 497 (Sindh) " Syed Qamar
Alam_vs_the State. In the light of these
precedents, specially in view of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan made a prayer for
grant of bail in favour of the Petitioner as mere
pendency of criminal case under alike offences
is no ground for refusal of bail. Inversely,
learned counsel for the complainant referred to
2016 MLD 451 (Peshawar) " Jamal Shah vs
the _State_and_another", 2014 MLD _ 433
Sindh) " Farhaj Ahmed vs the State", 2013

YLR 1603 (Lahore) " Sardar Bahadar Mughal

ys the State and another", 2012 P Cr. LJ 1956

(@eshawar) " Makhdoom Zada Abdul Karim
Nawab

vs_the State and another", 2012 P Cr. LJ 918
(Sindh) _and"Muhammad_Naseem_vs__ the
State". Thereby opposing the grant of bail on
the pretext that the Petitioner is habitual being
involved in similar kind of offences previously,
besides a huge amount of the complainant is at
stake, so at present in view of the dictums of the
Hon'ble higher Courts no exceptional ground

exist for grant of bail.

6. As far as the referral of cases
registered against the accused/Petitioner and on
its basis being not entitled to the concession of
bail is concerned, suffice it to say, it pertains to
previous report vide FIR No. 1003 dated
05.10.2016 under sections 489-F, 420 PPC
registered at Police Station Mingora. In view of
the ibid FIR the matter was later on patched up
between the parties. However another FIR
bearing No. 542 has been referred to, wherein
accused/Petitioner has been given role to have
shared common intention with other co-accused
and has not been directly charged for a definite

sum. When an accused being charged under
Nawab

similar offence within the meaning of section
489-F PPC for dishonestly issuing a cheque, it
has been held in case cited as 2014 YLR 497
Sindh) " Syed Qamar Ali vs the State" in the

following manner:-

"mere pendency of another criminal
case, or registration of another FIR
against accused, could not be held as
valid ground for refusal of bail; and
unless it was brought on record that
accused had been convicted in a case of
alike nature. Accused having made out a
case for grant of bail, he was admitted to

bail, in circumstances."
7. Whereas section 420 PPC _ is
bailable and under section 489-F PPC when an
accused is charged he might be refused bail if at
all there are reasons to believe that some
exceptional reason exist for refusal. In this case,
there is no specific reason available on the
record as to why accused/Petitioner being
involved in offence of alike nature the
punishment of which would entail to three years
would be refused bail, if otherwise he is not
previously convicted under the similar type of

case.
Nawab

8. The Petitioner is entitled to the
concession of bail. He is asked to furnish bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two
lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who
shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable

and men of means.

9. It would not be out of place to
mention here that the observations rendered
above are purely tentative in nature by all
counts and the learned Trial Court Judge would
be at liberty to apply his own judicial mind
without being prejudice to the findings

delivered in this judgment.

These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.

Dt: 24.05.2017. JUDGE
