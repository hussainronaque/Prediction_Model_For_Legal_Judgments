which was dismissed on 01.02.2017.

3. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned State counsel,

record with their assistance gone through.

4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

relied on 2016 YER 865 (Peshawar) "'" Naik

Amal ys the State and another", 2017 YLR 93

(Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court) "Mir Nawaz vs
the State", 2012 P Cr. LJ 1883 (Peshawar) "

Cr. L J 1667 (Peshawar) "Bahadur Said vs the

Shahid Raziq alias Shahid vs the State" and
prayed for the grant of bail in favour of
accused/Petitioner. Inversely learned counsel

for the complainant referred to 2008 SCMR 678

"" Muhammad Rafique vs the State", 2004 P
Cr. LJ 962 (Lahore) "' Liagat Ali vs the State",
2003 _YLR_ 2131 (Karachi) "" Jumman_alias

678 "" Muhammad Rafique vs the State. In the
light of wisdom contained in these dictums of
the Hon'ble superior Courts prayed for utter

dismissal of the bail application.

5. Just after the occurrence, the
Petitioner was apprehended by the police
officials, whose card of arrest is dated
30.12.2016. The Petitioner is named in the First
Information Report, who alongwith, while
sharing common intention of his brothers he is
charged for effective firing upon the
complainant. Keeping the nature of the injury
being inflicted to the complainant, the dictum
laid down in the judgment cited as NER 2009
Criminal 175 titled as "' Sadullah vs the State",

reads as under:-

(c) S324. Fact that injury to
complainant was not on vital and
sensitive part of his body would, as such,
bring the case of accused outside
embargo of S. 497 (1) which would
disentitle accused to grant of bail.

It has been held in 2008 SCMR 678

titled as!â€™ Muhammad Rafique vs the State" that

"accused was attributed role of direct firing at the
complainant who had sustained injuries on the

lower part of his body. Fact that there was no

Nawab
Nawab

injury on the sensitive part of the body of the
complainant, would not as such bring the case out
of the purview of the prohibitory clause of S. 497

(1) Cr. P.C."

6. Admittedly this is a cross case of the
case FIR No. 254 dated 30.12.2016 registered
under sections 302,34 PPC at Levy Post Sakhakot.
In the cross case complainant of this case has been
refused bail. Parties are cousins inter se, therefore
propriety demands that if one party in a cross case
has been refused bail then similar treatment should
be given to the other party, if there are reasons to
believe that the party seeking bail per role does not

entitle him to bail.

7. In view of the above, this Petition for
the grant of bail has got no force, which is hereby

dismissed.
