IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Accused/ petitioner, Murad

Ali, involved in case F.I.R No. 527, dated 09.08.2015,

under sections 302/324//34 PPC of Police Station, Lakki

Marwat, was refused bail by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-IV, Lakki Marwat, vide its order dated
21.11.2015. He has moved this further application

through his counsel for the same relief.

2. The allegations against the accused/ petitioner, as

per F.I.R, referred to above, are that on 09.08.2015 at

0730 hours, complainant Malik Zafrullah reported the

matter in the Civil hospital, Lakki Marwat that on the

eventful day, at 0635 hours, he alongwith other deceased

Thsanullah, injured Fidaullah, his brothers, proceeded to

“Maila Bazar” Lakki Marwat for purchasing house hold

articles; that at some distance from their house, at matled

road Michan Khel to Begu Khel near house of

complainant towards Muhallah Michan Khel,

accused/petitioner Murad Ali alongwith other accused

Mirzali, armed with kalashnikvs while Taj Ali Khan

armed with repeater residents of Michan Khel were

already standing there; that on seeing complainant party,

all the accused started firing at them with their respective

weapons with intend to commit their qatl-i-amd,

resultantly, from firing of accused/ petitioner Murad Ali,
Thsanullah (brother of complainant), while from the firing

of accused Mirzali, Fidaullah, his other brother were hit,

while he (complainant) luckily escaped unhurt. Accused

decamped from the spot. When he attended his brother

Thsanullah, he was expired there and then, while his other

brother Fidaullah was got injured. Motive is stated to be a

dispute of landed property in between them. Hence all the

accused were booked in FIR, ibid for the said offence.

3. I have heard the exhaustive arguments of the

learned counsel for the parties, A.A. G for the state and

have gone through the record with their valuable

assistance.

4. The objection against the petitioner is that he

has been charged specifically by name for “Qatl-i-amd”

of deceased Ihsanullah, whereas the occurrence had been

witnessed not only by the complainant but also by the

injured PW, who alongwith the complainant in company

of the deceased were on the way to market. From the

place of occurrence, 47 crimes empties wee recovered,
alongwith blood stained earth and 3 crime empties of .12

bore.

5. The post mortem report of the deceased and

that of the injured PW, fully prima facie corroborate the

version of the prosecution.

6. The petitioner had succeeded twice to get

bail before arrest but never appeared before the court of

Sessions, however, this court, thereafter not confirming

his bail before arrest, was taken into custody by the local

police on 21/10/2015.

7. This Court, while confirming bail before

arrest of the co-accused in the same case, has already

given its findings on merit of the case, in regard to the

petitioner in hand. In case in hand, one young innocent

person has been murdered while the other one was

seriously injured and the petitioner has been attributed

specific role of firing at the deceased. The medical as

well as rest of the circumstantial evidence, and ocular eye

witness accounts of two persons, supports and prima facie
corroborate the prosecution version. Keeping in view,

the evidence so far collected by investigating agency,

prima facie connect the petitioner with the commission of

the offence of “Qatl-i-amd”, which entails, capital

punishment, squarely falls within prohibitory clause of

section 497 Cr.P.C.

8. It is by now settled proposition of law, that

at bail granting stage, only evidence shall be tentatively

assessed and deeper appreciation of evidence is not

requirement of law, rather not permissible.

9. The contention of the learned counsel, that,

it is a case of two versions and the complainant party,

were also charged in the cross FIR No.528 under section

324 PPC at the same police station and the time of

occurrence is also the same, where one person from

accused side had sustained serious fire Arms injuries, is

not conceivable at this stage, for the sole reason, that the

complainant of FIR No.528 is not mentioned at any

category in the present case. According to the
complainant in case FIR No.528, he was hit by firing of

injured PW and other accused therein had made

indiscriminate firing but not a single crime empty has

been recovered therefrom the alleged place of occurrence

of cross FIR No.528.

10. The record of cross FIR No.528 is also

placed in this case, whereas the place of occurrence, in

both the alleged occurrence is different. A road is existing

between every two alleged place of occurrence.

11. Mere plea of cross version, could not be a

ground for release of an accused, however, the

complainant of cross FIR No.528 had not stated a single

word, in regard to all the accused, mentioned in the

instant case. The complainant in case FIR No.528 has

also not disclosed anything in regard to the present

occurrence and not related by any degree with the present

accused.

12. Any how as that it may be, that there is

another case FIR, against the PWs of this case and they
are on bail, the non-recovery of crime empties, blood

stained earth, therefrom the alleged place of occurrence,

as pointed out to the investigation officer, in cross FIR

No.528 creates serious doubts, in regard to the time and

place as alleged therein, which would be properly dealt

with by trial court. Presently, the petitioner is involved

and prima facie, connected with a serious offence of

“Qatl-i-amd”, and all the surrounding facts and

circumstances, fully supported the prosecution version.

13. Therefore, for the reasons mentioned herein

above this petition is dismissed accordingly.

Announced.
