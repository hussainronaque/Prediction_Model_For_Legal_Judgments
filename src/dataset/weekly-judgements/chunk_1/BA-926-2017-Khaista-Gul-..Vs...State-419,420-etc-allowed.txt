JUDGMENT

Date of hearing................. 19.06.2017..........

Petitioner: | (Khaista Gul) by Mr. Alam Sher Khan,
Advocate.

Respondent :( State) by Mr. Moeen-ud-Din Humayun, AAG.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through the instant
petition, the accused/petitioner is seeking post arrest
bail in case FIR No.304 dated 14.04.2017 under
sections 419/420/268/471/34 PPC r/w 3/4 Prohibition
(Enforcement of Hadd) Order and Section 14
Foreigners Act, of Police Station Gulbahar, District
Peshawar.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the
crime report is that, during gasht, Zahid Khan ASI
received a spy information that accused-petitioner
Khaista Gul has prepared a forged CNIC in the name
of Islam Gul, and with the help of accused Liaqat Ali
son of Gul Muhammad resident of Village Rashid
Gari would attempt to transport liquor and for this
purpose he is present at Afridi bridge with Tapka

(gallon) containing liquor. On the receipt of this
information the complainant alongwith other police
officials went to the spot, apprehended the
accused/petitioner and recovered four Tapkay
containing 120 liquor litters. On his personal search a
forged (as alleged) coloured photo copy of CNIC
bearing No.17301-1291899-7 in the name of Islam
Gul son of Shehbaz Khan was recovered from his
front pocket. On cursory interrogation the accused
disclosed that the contraband is jointly owned by him
and co-accused Liaqat Ali. The accused was taken
into custody on the spot.

3. The learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner sought bail on the following
grounds;

i. That sections 419/420/468/471 PPC and
14 Foreigners Act are not applicable
under the attending circumstances of the
case.

il. His second contention was that section
419/420/468/471 and article 3/4 P.O are
not hit by the restrictive clause of
section 497 Cr.P.C.

iii. Thirdly that the accused/petitioner is not
a previous convict and is no longer
required for the purpose of investigation.

iv. That the FSL report of the sample of
contraband/liquor is not available on the

record.
4. The learned AAG appearing on behalf of
the State vehemently opposed the contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioner and argued that huge
quantity of contraband/liquor was recovered from the
possession of the accused/petitioner, therefore he is
not entitled for bail.

5. I have given my anxious consideration to
the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioner and State.

6. Perusal of record reveals that the
Investigation Officer has neither obtained FSL report
in respect of the contraband liquor nor verified the
CNIC in question from NADRA to ascertain its
genuineness or otherwise. During arguments the
learned counsel for the accused/petitioner produced
original CNIC of the brother of the accused, namely,
Islam Gul for perusal of the Court, copy whereof is
already appended with the bail application. Scanning
of record further reveals that name of the father of the
accused/petitioner and Islam Gul are one and the
same. So far as Section 14 Foreigners Act is
concermed, the evidence against the accused is still to
be evaluated and it is yet to be seen as to whether it is
applicable under the attending circumstances of the

case or not. The learned counsel for the petitioner
drew my attention to a decision of a Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan in case of “Haji Wali Muhammad
vs. The State” reported in 1969 SCMR-233. The
Supreme Court held as under:-
“As a general rule on a charge of the
kind made in this case not invoking a
sentence of death or transportation for
life, bail should ordinarily be allowed
disregarding the grounds of the
seriousness or anti-social nature of the
offence, unless there are strong grounds,
in the shape of evidence for the belief
that he is guilty”.
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner
also placed reliance on PLD 1988 Karachi-64,
wherein the accused was charged under section
14-Foreigners Order, 1951, Article 3(a) he was
allowed bail. Reliance can well be made on MLD
2017 Page 259, wherein it was held that bail cannot
be denied to the accused, when it is a well settled
Principle of law that bail cannot be withheld as
conviction in advance. The rest of the sections do not
fall within the prohibition contained in Section 497
Cr.P.C. Moreover, the accused/petitioner is neither
required for the purpose of investigation nor he is

previous convict. Therefore, I am of the opinion that

the reasonable grounds do exist for believing that the
matter requires further probe into the guilt of the
accused/petitioner.

8. In view of above, this petition is accepted
and the accused/petitioner is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.2,00,000/-
(Rupees two lac) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the learned
Illaqa/Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the

sureties must be local, reliable and men of means.

Announced.
