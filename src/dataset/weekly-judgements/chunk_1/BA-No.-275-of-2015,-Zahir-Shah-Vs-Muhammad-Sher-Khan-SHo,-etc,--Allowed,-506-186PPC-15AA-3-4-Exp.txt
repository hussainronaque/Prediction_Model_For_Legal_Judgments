B.A No. 275-B of 2015
JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 20.11.2015

Appellant-Petitioner: By __ Sultan _ Mehmood
Khan,Advocate.

Respondent : State by Qudrat Ullah

Khan Gandapur, AAG.

TKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.--- Zahir Shah, the

accused/ petitioner involved in case F.I.R No. 178

dated 27.09.2015, under section 56/186 PPC, 15

AA, 5 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Explosive Substances

Act, 3/4 P.O of Police Station Marian, Bannu, was

refused bail by the learned Additional Sessions

Judge,-I, Bannu, vide order dated 14.10.2015. He

has moved this further application through counsel

for his release on bail.
2. Brief facts of the case, as per FIR, are

that there were complaints against Zahir Shah that

he is involved in the business of selling (desi) local-

made wine. After obtaining search warrant, the

complainant Muhammad Bashir Khan SHO,

alongwith Police Nafri and lady constables, under

the leadership of Syed Khan DSP Range, raided at

the house of accused-petitioner, as a result of which

the local police recovered, a Kalashnikov with fit

magazine, containing 20 live rounds of 7.62 bore, a

spare magazine containing 15 live rounds of 7.62

bore, a 30 bore pistol with fit magazine containing 5

rounds of 30 bore, a bandolier containing three hand

grenades and eight plastic drums containing total

240 liter vine. Accused-petitioner was arrested,

murasila was drafted, which culminated into above

mentioned FIR.

3. Learned counsel ffor petitioner

contended that the charges leveled against the
accused-petitioner are vogue, not specific in so far

as the section 5 of Explosive Act, is concern, while

rest of the offences for which the petitioner has

charged does not carry punishment of death, life or

above 10 years; that the case against the accused-

petitioner is that of further inquiry, as the alleged

recovery of explosive substance, had not effected

therefrom the personal possession of the petitioner;

that the petitioner has been sent to judicial custody

and no more required for further investigation into

the case.

4. On the other hand, learned AAG on

behalf of the State, contended that, the accused-

petitioner has committed a schedule offence, which

is exclusively triable by the Anti-terrorism Court

(ATC) but the petitioner had not approached, the

competent court, therefore, this petition is not

competent.
5. I have heard learned counsel for the

parties and have also gone through the record, in

view of the argument, rendered by learned counsel.

6. Prior to discuss, tentatively, the merits

of the case for the purpose of bail, it would be not

out of context to resolve the objection of learned

AAG, whereas on the same ground bail petition of

petitioner, has been dismissed by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge, below.

7. The learned Additional Sessions Judge,

has held that, the offence for which the petitioner

has charged in the F.I.R by the local police, is

exclusively triable by the Anti-terrorism Court

(ATC) therefore, the concession of bail was declined

to the petitioner.

8. It is admitted fact, conceivable

thereefrom the available record, that petitioner has

been charged under section 15 AA and 5 Explosive
(It is not known whether the section of law applied

against the petitioner would be construed as “section

5 of the Explosive Substances Act, or Explosive

Act) However, keeping in view the explosive

allegedly recovered therefrom the petitioner are

hand grenades, which falls within the ambit of 5 of

the Explosive Substances Act, the offence of

unlawful possession of explosive as defined

thereunder Antiterrorism Act, 1997 (ATA) falls

within the clause “ee” of section 6(2) of the ATA,

which is punishable under section 7(ff) of ATA,

wherein the punishment provided shall not be less

than 14 years, but may extend to imprisonment for

life. However, petitioner has not been charged,

under section 7 (ff) of the ATA.

9. In so far, the question of jurisdiction of

the ordinary court is concerned, the learned

Additional Sessions Judge has not properly
construed the provision of section 21 (G) of the

ATA, which read as:

21-G. Trial of offences. All offences
under this Act, shall be tried
exclusively by the Anti-Terrorism

Court established under this Act.

So the offences, mentioned in the schedule of ATA,
shall also be exclusively tried by the ATC, but mere
having any unlawful explosive is not included in the

3" schedule item 4, which read as:

THE THIRD SCHEDULE.

4. Without prejudice to the
generality of the above paragraphs,
the anti-terrorism Court to the
exclusion of any other Court shall try
the offences relating to the following,
namely:--

(i

(ii) Use of  fire-arms or
explosives by any device, including
bomb blast in a mosque,
imambargah, church, temple or any

other place of worship, whether or
not any hurt or damage is caused
thereby; or

(iii) firing or use of explosives
by any device, including bomb blast

in the Court premises.
So, the offence, as alleged in the FIR, allegedly
committed by the petitioner does not occupy any
place, within the purview of schedule 3™ item 4

thereof.

10. Section 15 (e) of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013, could be read as:

“has in his possession or under his
control any arms or ammunition in
contravention of the provision of
section 9;

Shall be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which may
extend to seven years or with fine,
which may extend to two lacs, or

with both.”
11. Subsection (i) (a) (iv) of section 3 of
Arms Act, 2013, include grenade within the

definition of ammunition, which read as:
“Ammunition” includes---

(iv) All types of grenades, bombs,
rockets, mines and fuels for flame

throwers;

12. While Section 5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

Explosive Substances Act, 2013 read as:

5. Punishment for making or
possessing explosives under
suspicious circumstances.--- Any
person who makes of knowingly has
in possession or under his control
any explosive substance, under such
circumstances as to give rise to a
reasonable suspicion that he is not
making it or does not have it in his
possession or under his control for a
lawful object, shall, unless he can
show that he made it or had it in his
possession or under his control for a
lawful object, be punishable wit
imprisonment for a term which may

extend to fourteen years.
13. But this court could not bypass the

provision of section 71 of the PPC, which read as:

“71. Limit of punishment of
offence made up of several offences.
Where anything which is an offence
is made up of parts, any of which
parts is itself an offence, the offender
shall not be punished with the
punishment of more than one of such
his offences, unless it be so expressly
provided.

Where anything is an offence falling
within two or more _ separate
definitions of any law in force for the
time being by which offences are
defined or punished, or

where several acts, of which one or
more than one would by itself or
themselves constitute an offence,
constitute, when combined, a
different offence, the offender shall
not be punished with a more severe
punishment than the Court which
tries him could award for any one of

such offences.
-10-

14. The explosive grenade is not directly

recovered therefrom the exclusive possession of the

petitioner nor on its pointation, while keeping in

view the provision of section 71 of the PPC, there is

likelyhood that, petitioner even if found guilty,

would be extended, the benefit of section 71 of the

PPC, which, makes the case against the petitioner

that of further inquiry, as no other offence allegedly

committed by the petitioner falls within the

prohibition clause of section 497 Cr.PC. The search

of joint residential house of the accused-petitioner,

wherefrom the explosive substance, ammunition etc

were allegedly recovered, not carried out in presence

of private witnesses. I did not find any expert report

in regard to the grenade, although other arms,

allegedly recovered, were sent to the FSL and the

FSL report is placed on record. Mere, recovery of

any alleged explosive substance, without expert

opinion would not withhold the concession of bail to
-l1ll-

an accused. Reliance may be placed on “Ihsanullah

Vs. the State” (PLD 1995 Peshawar 106).

15. For the aforestated reasons, this bail

petition is accepted and the petitioner be released on

bail, provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of

Rs.200000/- (two lac) with two sureties each in the

like amount to the satisfaction of Illqa/ Judicial

Magistrate concerned.
