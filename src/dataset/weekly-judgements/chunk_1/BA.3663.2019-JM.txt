JUDGMENT

sR A

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the petition in hand, the

petitioner, Roidad Khan seeks his post arrest bail in case
FIR No. 65 dated 08.10.2019 under sections 302-
PPC/15-AA, P.S. Jamrod (District Khyber). Same relief
was however declined to him by the leaned trial Court
vide order dated 26.11.2019.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the complainant
reported the matter to local police in terms that on the
eventful day his son left the house for Isha prayer, but
did not return home. On 03.10.2019, he was informed
that his son is lying dead in the ground of Ghazali Public
School, when reached the spot, he found his son
murdered with firearm. Initially he charged nobody for

the commission of offence, however, later on, the
present accused was charged for the murder of his son,
hence the instant petition for bail.

3. Argument of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record gone through.

4.  Perusal of record reveals that initially nobody was
charged for the commission of offence. It so happened,
when the complainant recorded his 164 Cr.P.C statement
before the learned Judicial Magistrate on 17.10.2019,
after a considerable delay and without disclosing his
source of information and stated that his son was put to
death by the present petitioner.

5. Being an unseen occurrence, there is no direct
evidence to prima facie connect the present accused with
the commission of offence. Be that as it may, suffice it
to say that the evidence regarding last mobile contact in
absence of any corroborative evidence is a weak type of
evidence, especially when it has not been mentioned in
the FIR that at what time deceased was lastly seen in the
company of the accused.

6. So far as recovery of weapon of offence and burnt
mobile of deceased are concerned, the same were not
recovered from the direct possession of the accused,
which would also require pro & contra evidence during
trial. In this regard reliance could be safely placed on

case law reported in 2017 SCMR 61, 2014 SCMR 12.
7. In the circumstances, case of accused-petitioner
will require further probe to establish his involvement in
the commission of offence through reliable evidence as
provided under Sub-Section (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C,
where grant of bail is a rule and refusal thereof is an
exception. Petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest
and is no more required for further investigation.

8. Moreover, it has been held time and again by the
august Supreme Court that bail does not mean acquittal
of accused but only change of custody from Government
agencies to the sureties, who on furnishing bonds take
responsibility to produce the accused whenever and
wherever required to be produced. Reliance could be
placed on case reported in 2008 SCMR_807_ “Haji
Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

9. Before parting with the order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded
above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of bail
petition and not intended to influence the mind of trial Court,
which is free to appraise the evidence strictly in accordance

with law and merits of the case and; as per law laid down in

(1996 SCMR 1845).

10. In view of the above discussion and on tentative
assessment of material available on file, a case arguable

for the grant of bail is made out. Resultantly, this
petition is allowed and the accused-petitioner, named
above, is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties, each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate, concerned, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

11. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of
even date.
