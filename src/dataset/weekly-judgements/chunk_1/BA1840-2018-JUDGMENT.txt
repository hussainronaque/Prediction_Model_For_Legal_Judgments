WAQAR AHMAD SETH, CJ: - Accused-petitioner,
Muhammad Ali alias Ali son of Nabi Gul, charged in case
vide FIR No. 579 dated 04.07.2018, under section
302/114/34 PPC, registered in Police Station Sarband,
Peshawar, has approached this Court for his release on bail,
which was refused to him by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-V, Peshawar, vide order dated 03.09.2018.

2. As per contents of FIR, the case of prosecution
is that, complainant Abdur Raziq, present in HMC, while
reporting the matter to police has stated that he was present

with his deceased mother, when his maternal uncle Wazir

i Gul alongwith accused-petitioner and co-accused Sher Ali
son of Nabi Gul and Nabi Gul son of Gul Raheem came in
order to settle the matter, and during talks, accused exchange
hot words with his deceased mother, and upon the
instigation of accused-petitioner and his father i.e. co-
accused Nabi Gul, accused Sher Ali opened indiscriminate
firing upon his mother with the intention to kill her, due to
which she got hit and on way to hospital, succumbed to the
injuries, hence the instant FIR.

3. I have heard learned counsel for the parties,
learned AAG for the State and available record gone
through.

4. Be that as it may, record suggests that accused-
petitioner alongwith co-accused Sher Ali & Nabi Gul have
been charged by the complainant Abdur Raziq, who happens
to be the brother in law of accused-petitioner and co-accused
Sher Ali for the murder of his mother, reportedly killed
during Jirga talks, duly witnessed by Mst. Saira & Lubna,
who on 11.7.2018, while recording their statement under
section 164 Cr.PC have reiterated the contents of FIR.

yi Present accused-petitioner though directly been charged in
the FIR, but has been given the role of ‘Lalkara’ on which
his brother co-accused attacked the mother of complainant
with his respective weapon of offence, which was recovered
from the possession of co-accused Sher Ali and vide
Forensic Science Laboratory, report dated 2.8.2018, the
recovered empty shell match with the pistol, so recovered
and nothing qua active role or any weapon, has stated to be
in his possession during the alleged occurrence, therefore,
the role of Lalkara and its effect, so attributed to the present
accused-petitioner would determined during trial, after
recording of evidence, as co-accused also attributed the said
role has died on 23.7.2018 in Jail Hospital. Accused-
petitioner in the case, is simply blamed for raising ‘Lalkara’
for killing the deceased, and in that connection, he had not
been ascribed with any role of fire upon the deceased. FIR
had not revealed that accused was armed with any weapon at
relevant time. Reliance is placed on 2014 YLR-200.
Furthermore, no overt act in the commission of offence,
except for raising “Lalkara” and no doubt, the proclamation

hb of “Lalkara” was not mere proverbial but commanding one
and for which the petitioner could be held liable for
abetment, and its punishment would not fall within the
prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C. After, arrest,
accused-petitioner has been investigated / interrogated but
nothing beneficial or recovery / discovery has been brought
on record and nor he has confessed the guilt. Investigation in
the case is complete and he is no more required to the
prosecution for investigation etc, and keeping him behind
the bars for indefinite would serve no useful purpose, that
too; falling within the ambit of subection-2 of section 497
Cr.PC. Moreover, a mistaken relief of bail may be repaired
by convicting the accused, if proved guilty, but no proper
reparation can be offered for his unjustified incarceration,
albeit, his acquittal in the long run. Reliance is placed on the
case of Zaigham Ashraf versus the State and_others,

reported in 2016 SCMR-18.

5. From the tentative assessment of record
petitioner has made out a case arguable for the purpose of
bail, resultantly the same is allowed and accused-petitioner

yi be released on bail, provided he furnishes bail bonds to the
tune of Rs. 2, 00,000/- with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa / Duty Magistrate, who
shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

6. Needless to mention here that the tentative
made hereinabove are tentative in nature and shall not

prejudice the case of either side during trial.

7. These are the reasons of my short order of even date.
