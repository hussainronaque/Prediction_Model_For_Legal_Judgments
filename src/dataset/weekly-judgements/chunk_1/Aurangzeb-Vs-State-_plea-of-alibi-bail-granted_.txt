ORDER

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Aurangzeb, being unsuccessful before the two courts
below to get the concession of post arrest bail, through this
further petition, seeks the same concession from this Court,
in case FIR No.311 dated 22.08.2015, registered under
sections 302/324/427/34 PPC, in Police Station Lahor,
District Swabi.

2. On 22.08.2015 at 14.30 hours, complainant
Danish, in company of dead body of his brother Shahzad
Khan deceased reported to local police that on fateful day
he alongwith his mother Mst. Samina and deceased while
returning home from the house of his relative in a motorcar
No.LX-57, when reached “Sawabi Jehangira road Beka
Shakh”, petitioner Aurangzeb alongwith his son Shah Zeb
(absconding co-accused), duly armed with firearms present

there, opened fire at them with the intention to commit

their Qatl-e-Amd, as a result, the deceased got hit and died
on the spot, while he and his mother luckily remained
unscathed. Damage to his motor car due to firing of the
accused has also been alleged. A dispute over landed
property is stated to be a motive behind the incident.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner while
arguing the case on merits contended that the incident is
unseen and alleged eyewitnesses Danish and Mst. Samina,
being brother and mother of the deceased, respectively, are
procured witnesses. He while referring to the dimensions
of injuries on the person of the deceased in autopsy report
contended that charge has been exaggerated. He, however,
strongly stressed for release of the petitioner on bail on the
plea of alibi by contending that petitioner left Pakistan for
Abdu Dhabi on 20.08.2015 at 04.15 hours i.e. (two days
prior to the incident) from Benazir International Airport
Islamabad, and landed there in UAE on 20.08.2015 at
08.40 hours, wherefrom he left for Bangkok Thailand and
landed in Airport of Bangkok at 18.20 hours on the same
day; that getting knowledge of his false involvement in the
instant case, the petitioner on 24.08.2015 at 23.00 hours,
reached Pakistan and landed at Lahore airport. He
produced original passport and Boarding Pass of the

petitioner qua his above travelling for perusal of the Court

(original seen and returned). He further contended that
petitioner took the plea of alibi soon after his arrival to
Pakistan by submitting application to DIG Mardan Region,
on which inquiry was conducted and according to report of
the Inquiry Officer furnished on the basis of record of the
concemed Airports, petitioner was abroad on the day and
time of occurrence. He contended that the plea of alibi of
petitioner get supports from the documentary evidence of
the Airports, his passport, ticket and boarding card coupled
with the opinion of the Inquiry Officer; therefore, he is
entitled to the concession of bail. He placed reliance on the
following judgments:-

. 19980 SCMR 920

. 1997 SCMR 1829

. PLD 1998 Supreme Court 97.

. PLD 2006 (Lahore) 689

. 2015 YLR (Lahore) 2441

. 2012 MLD (Sindh) 1876
. 2013 P Cr L J (Peshawar) 1318.

4. Conversely, learned counsel for the
complainant while controverting the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner on merits contended that
petitioner is directly charged for murder of the deceased by
the eyewitnesses in a promptly lodged report eliminating
the possibility of consultation and deliberation; that being a
broad daylight incident, question of mistaken identity does

not arise; that autopsy report of the deceased and

recoveries from the spot supports the ocular version and
prima facie connects the petitioner with the commission of
offence. On plea of alibi, learned counsel contended such
plea cannot be taken into consideration at bail stage, rather
can be considered by the Trial Court in light of the
evidence led by prosecution and defence during trial. He
added that if such plea is allowed at this stage it would
amount to giving of a clear chit of acquittal to the accused
before the learned Trial Court. In support of his
contentions he placed reliance on the following
judgments:-

. 2013 SCMR 385

. 2012 SCMR 707

. 2015 P Cr L J (Peshawar) 1083
. 2010 PCr LJ (Peshawar) 1386

5. Learned AAG adopted the arguments of
learned counsel for the complainant.

6. I have considered the exhaustive arguments
advanced from either side.

7. Since the main stress of the arguments from
both the sides was on the plea of alibi, therefore, I would
like to dilate upon the same to the extent of bail.

8. Plea of alibi is that form of defence through
which accused attempts to prove that he was in some other
place at the time when alleged offence was committed.

Alibi is Latin word, which means elsewhere. Plea of alibi

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

means that accused was physically not present at the time
of commission of offence. When the accused suggests to
the Court that he was somewhere else at the time of
commission of alleged offence, such suggestion is called
“plea of alibi’. In simple words the plea of absence of a
accused person from the place of occurrence at the time of
the commission of offence is called the plea of alibi, which
should be raised at the earliest time/ stage.

9. In the instant case the incident took place on
22.08.2015 at 13.30 hours and the petitioner alongwith
absconding co-accused has been charged directly in the
FIR by complainant for murder of the deceased. Petitioner
submitted application to DIG Mardan Region alleging his
innocence on the plea of alibi that two days prior to the
incident i.e. 20.08.2015 he left Pakistan for Abu Dhabi and
from Abu Dhabi to Bangkok and returned Pakistan on
24.08.2015. The application was marked to Hazrat Nabi
Khan Inspector Police Station Yar Hussain Swabi for
inquiry, who after conducting inquiry, submitted report.
During pendency of the instant proceeding, on 26.10.2015,
learned counsel for the petitioner requested for requisition
of the Inquiry report and personal attendance of Inspector
Hazrat Nabi, resultantly, he was summoned for

28.10.2015, on which date, he turned up alongwith Inquiry

report. After hearing the arguments, the case was posted to
30.10.2015, but while writing judgment the inquiry was
being found incomplete was directed to be returned to the
Inquiry Officer on 30.10.2015 with following observations:

“The case was fixed for order. It appears from
the record that besides merits, petitioner
Aurangzeb is also seeking bail on plea of alibi.
During the course of arguments the said plea
was strongly pressed by his counsel. He
contended that petitioner left Pakistan for Abu
Dhabi on 20.08.2015 i.e. two days prior to the
incident, wherefrom he allegedly proceeded to
Bangkok, where on getting information qua his
false involvement in the instant case, the
petitioner rushed to Pakistan on 24.08.2015.
While writing judgment, it revealed
from inquiry report conducted by Hazrat Nabi
Khan Inspector Police Station Yar Hussain, on
the application of the petitioner regarding his
plea of alibi that on one hand, the I.O. has not
furnished any final opinion qua _ the
authenticity or otherwise of the plea of alibi of
the petitioner, while on the other hand, he has
not recorded the statements of the concerned
officials of the relevant departments/sections
of the Airports wherefrom the petitioner
departed from Pakistan and arrived back to
Pakistan. He has neither taken into possession
the passport of the petitioner, the boarding
pass/card of the concerned airports in respect
of his travelling well as other relevant record
from emigration department of the airports.
Besides, it is the era of advance technology
and in each airport CCTV cameras are
installed for the purpose of surveillance of the
passengers entering into the airports in respect
of their travelling. But the I.O. has not taken
pain to collect all these material for digging the
truth. He has also not verified about the
travelling ticket of the petitioner. It is case of
murder, on one hand precious life of the
deceased while on the other hand the liberty of
the petitioner claiming innocence are involved.
The Enquiry Officer has only placed on file a

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

copy of R-11 (Travel History) of the petitioner
from Federal Investigation Agency Integrated
Board Management System, but this document
too does not bear any stamp or signature of the
responsible Officer and well in its bottom it
has been mentioned that the same is not for
Court use. The I.O. has also annexed an
undertaking tendered by the complainant and
Legal heirs of the deceased regarding their
stance qua involvement of the petitioner in the
commission of offence. There was no need of
annexing this document with the inquiry. What
was essential and inevitable in the matter has
not been done by the Enquiry Officer. The real
job of the Enquiry Officer, was to unearth the
real facts by collecting all relevant material in
respect of the travelling of the petitioner
coupled with the statements of the concerned
officials of the airports, in light whereof he had
to furnish his opinion, which though would not
be binding upon the court, but an inquiry
without final opinion of the Enquiry Officer in
light of what he has collected, would not be
complete and would serve no purpose. The
purpose of an inquiry is always to dig out the
real facts without any fear and favour in the
interest of justice.

In view of the above, order could not
be announced. The inquiry qua the plea of
alibi of the petitioner has not been properly
conducted, therefore, in the interest of justice,
the same is returned to Hazrat Nabi Inspector
Police Station Yar Hussain, with the direction
to re-inquire the plea of alibi of the petitioner
in light of observations made in the order and
to submit report within a fortnight, positively
and to appear in person on the next date i.e.
16.11.2015”.

10. In light of the above directions, Hazrat Nabi
Khan Inspector, after completing the inquiry resubmitted
his report. According to his opinion furnished on the basis
of documentary evidence collected from Benazir

International Airport Islamabad and Lahore Airport in

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

connection with the passport number of the petitioner i.e.
AJ-5094182, the petitioner left Pakistan on 20.08.2015 for
Abu Dhabi wherefrom he left for Thailand Bangkok on the
same day and reached there at 18.20 hours. He returned to
Pakistan on 24.08.2015 at Lahore Airport. All the relevant
documents showing exit and entry of the petitioner on the
relevant dates in the Airports of Pakistan have been
annexed with the inquiry report. Besides, the Inquiry
Officer in his opinion has categorically mentioned that
keeping in view the travelling record of the petitioner,
according to which on 20.08.2015, he left Pakistan for Abu
Dhabi, his participation and presence on the spot at the
time of commission of offence on 22.08.2015, is beyond
his understanding. The relevant words of the Inquiry

Officer read as under:-

No doubt, the opinion of the I.O or the inquiry Officer in
respect of plea of alibi of the accused is not binding upon
the Court, but it can be considered for grant of bail, if same
is based on sound reasoning. Apart from above, this court
by itself examined the original passport, ticket and
boarding Card of the petitioner, showing his departure

from Pakistan on 20.08.2015 to Abu Dhabi at 0840 hours,

via flight EY 408 and his arrival to Pakistan on 24.08.2015
at 19.40 hours at Lahore via flight TG345. Thus, the plea
of alibi taken by the petitioner is not only, prima facie,
supported by the documents available on the record but
augmented by report of the Inquiry Officer.

11. True that normally the Courts are reluctant to
consider plea of alibi at bail stage, but this is not a
principle of universal applicability and in appropriate cases
where a strong plea of alibi has been put forward without
any loss of time and the same has been found to be
authentic, Court can grant bail on the plea of alibi. In case
titled “Khalid Javai Vs the State (PLD 1978 SC 256) the
the Hon’ble Supreme Court granted bail to the accused on
the plea of alibi. The learned Lahore High Court in case
titled, “Arshad Mehmood Vs the State” (PLD 2006
Lahore 689), case titled, “Malik Noor Ahmad and
others Vs the state (PLD 1993 Lahore 500), case titled,
“Iqbal Ahmad and two others Vs the State ” (1989 P
Cr L J 2122” has granted bail to the accused on the plea
of alibi. I would like to refer case titled, “Malik
Muhammad Saleem and others Vs Arshad Siddiq and 2
others” (1997 SCMR_ 1829), wherein in similar
circumstances the august Apex Court refused to cancel the

bail granted to the accused on the plea of alibi by the

10

august High Court. The relevant Paragraph of the
judgment read as under:-

“We have already referred to the discussion of
the three relevant authorities referred to by the
learned counsel for the petitioner in the
petitions but see no reason to come to the
conclusion that the learned Judge in the High
Court had acted unreasonably or perversely in
declining the cancellation of bail to the two
accused-respondents and granting bail to the
two other respondents in the two petitions. The
crux of the matter is that the learned Judge in
the High Court had himself “examined the
Passport, P.I.A. Ticket and other documents”
produced by the learned counsel for Kamran
Siddique and Laiq Siddique and had reached
the conclusion that the plea of alibi taken by the
said respondents was not only prima facie
supported by the documents available on the
record but was augmented by the report of
ASDPO Chamkani recorded by him on
22.12.1996”.

In case titled, “Ajmal Khan Vs Liaqat Hayat and
another” (PLD 1998 Supreme Court 97), the Hon’ble
Supreme Court granted bail to the accused on the plea of
alibi by observing as under:-

“Bail can be granted in a case of capital

charge on the plea of alibi if peculiar facts

and circumstances of that case so justify”.
In case titled, “Muhammad Azeem and others Vs the
State and others” (2015 YLR (Lahore) 2441 )_ the
learned Lahore High Court while granting bail to the

accused observed that plea of alibi raised in a bail matter

11

may not be outrightly rejected and can be gone into for the
purpose of grant or refusal of bail.

12. Deriving wisdom from the judgments (supra)
and keeping in view the mandate of S.497 Cr.P.C. which
does not contain any restriction on court’s power to assess
tentatively the material placed before it for the purpose of
grant or refusal of bail. Such material would not only be
the material collected in favour of the prosecution and
against an accused but would include all the material in
favour of the prosecution as well as in favour of the
defence. Court, however, had to refrain directly or
indirectly from giving any conclusive finding on the
question of guilt or innocence of accused. On tentative
assessment of the material available on record, I am not
going to give any findings qua innocence of the petitioner
in light of his plea of alibi rather would just hold that in
presence of documentary evidence in support of plea of
alibi of the petitioner coupled with the opinion of the
Inquiry Officer, at the moment the case of the petitioner is
that of the two versions, which one is correct, is yet to be
determined during trial, however, it makes the case of the
petitioner that of further inquiry into his guilt within the
meaning of sub-section 2 of $.497 Cr.P.C. and when an

accused became entitled to bail as of right under section

12

497 (2) Cr.P.C. the same cannot not be withheld as a
punishment on mere ground of he being directly charged
for heinous offence. It is settled law that a mistaken relief
of bail can be repaired by convicting the accused, if proved
guilty at the end of trial, but no proper reparation can be
offered to an accused for his unjustified incarceration,
albeit his acquittal in the long run.

13. For what has been discussed above, this
petition is allowed. The accused/petitioner is admitted to
bail provided he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and resourceful
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD concerned.

14. Before parting with the judgment, I would
like to point out that the observations made in the bail
granting being based on tentative assessment of the
material for the purpose of disposal of bail application
only, will not influence the mind of the learned Trial Court,
which shall decide the case on merits by appraising the
evidence strictly according to its merits on the available
evidence.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
