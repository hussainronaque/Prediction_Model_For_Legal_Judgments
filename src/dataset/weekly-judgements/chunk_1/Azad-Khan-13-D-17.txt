JUDGMENT SHEET
IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, D.LKHAN BENCH
(Judicial Department)

CrMQ No. 13-D of 2017
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 11.07.2017
Appellant-petitioner Azad Khan by Gul Tiaz Khan Marwat
advocate.
Respondent State by Mr. Adnan Ali Khan AAG and Mr.

Shaukat Ullah Bhittani Advocate for complainant

MUHAMMAD _AYUB_ KHAN, J.- Through the instant
petition under section 561-A Cr.P.C, the petitioner Azad
Khan seeks quashment of order dated 19.4.2017 rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan,
whereby an amount of Rs.5000/- as cost was imposed

upon him.

2. The petitioner was facing trial before learned
Judicial Magistrate-II, D.I.Khan in case FIR No.322 dated
21.5.2011 registered under section 381-A PPC at police
station Cantt: D.I.Khan when non-bailable warrant of
arrest was issued against him, against which he filed
criminal revision before learned Sessions Judge, D.I. Khan.
This revision petition was accepted by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-I, D.I.Khan vide judgment dated

19.4.2017 on cost of Rs.5,000/- to be paid to the
-2-

complainant within the meaning of section 344-A Cr.P.C
read with chapter I.D Para-15 of High Court rules and
orders which has been assailed through the instant

petition.

3. I have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the petitioner, learned Assistant Advocate General
representing the State and learned counsel for respondent

No.2 and have gone through the available record.

4. Perusal of impugned order reveals that revision
petition of the petitioner was accepted on cost of
Rs.5000/- to be paid to complainant within the meaning of
section 344-A Cr.P.C read with chapter I.D Para-15 of
High Court Rules and orders as, according to learned
Additional Sessions Judge, conduct of the petitioner
before the trial Court was not gentle. In order to
understand the spirit of above provisions, I deem it
appropriate to reproduce section 344-A Cr.P.C and
chapter I.D Para-15 of High Curt Rules and Orders which
are as follow:-
“344A. Conclusion of trial....The Court
shall, upon taking cognizance of a case under
sections 354-A, 376, 377 and 377B of the
Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860),
decide the case within three months failing
which the matter shall be brought by the Court

to the notice of the Chief Justice of the High
Court concerned for appropriate directions.”
“15. Cost of adjournment---The attention of

Criminal Courts is drawn to 20 P.R.1904 (Cr.)

in which it was held that the expression ‘on

such terms as it thinks fit’ in section 344 of the

Code gives the Court power to award costs for

an adjournment to the party to whom loss is

caused by such adjournment.”
Perusal of section 344-A Cr.P.C reveals that it has been
wrongly misinterpreted by learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I, D.I.Khan as it does not relate to cost as imposed,
but deals with disposal of cases under sections 354-A,
376, 377 and 377B PPC. Similarly, chapter I.D Para-15 of
High Court Rules and orders relates to the cost to be
imposed on adjournment of the case. In the instant case, it
was not imposed because of any adjournment but due to
conduct of petitioner and that too before the trial Court. In
my opinion, the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,
D.I.Khan failed to comprehend the meaning and spirit of
above reproduced provisions of law and wrongly imposed

cost of Rs.5000/-. Thus the impugned order to the extent

of imposition of cost is not sustainable.

5. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition is accepted and the impugned judgment dated
19.4.2017 to the extent of imposition of cost is set aside.
Announced.

Dt-:11.7.2017.
