JUDGMENT

Te CR

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the petition in hand,

petitioner (Umair) seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR
No.1101 dated 04.11.2019 u/s 377/511-PPC 1/w 53 CPA,
PS Tahkal (Peshawar). Same relief was declined to him
by the learned Trial Court vide order dated 21.11.2019.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the present
petitioner was charged by the complainant for trying to
subject his minor son to unnatural sexual intercourse.
Accordingly, FIR ibid was registered and the accused-
petitioner was taken into custody, hence the instant
petition for bail.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the occurrence took

place on 04.11.2019 at 16:30 hrs, but report was lodged
at 21:00 hrs after delay of about 4 and half hrs without
any plausible explanation.

5. No doubt, the contents of FIR show that the
present case was merely a case of an attempt which had
remained abortive or a case of a mere preparation. the
complainant has though charged accused for the
commission of offence, but no medical examination of
the victim was conducted, even nothing has been sent to
FSL for swab analysis. No incriminating evidence is
available on record to prima facie connect the accused-
petitioner with the commission of crime. Besides, no
other eyewitnesses stated to have attracted towards the
spot have been cited so as to support the version of
complainant. Reliance is placed on 2019 P.Cr.L.J_899.
& 2016 SCMR 2176.

6. _ So far as applicability of sections 53 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(hereinafter to be referred as the Act of 2010), is
concerned, it depicts that this law was_ specially
introduced/enacted and promulgated in the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa with particular purposes i.e. to provide for
the care, protection, maintenance, welfare, training,
education, rehabilitation and reintegration of ‘children at

risk’ in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference, the preamble of the Act

of 2010, is reproduced below:-

who

"WHEREAS, it is expedient to provide for the care,
protection, maintenance, welfare, training, education,
rehabilitation and reintegration of children at risk in
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa".

"Child at risk" has been defined under section 2(1)(e)
of the Act in the following words:-

"Child at risk" means a child in need of protection,

is at risk, including an orphan, child with
disabilities, child of migrant workers, child
working and or living on the street, child in
conflict with the law and child living in extreme
poverty.

is found begging; or

is found without having any home or settled
place of abode or without any ostensible
meaning of subsistence; or

has a parent or guardian who is unfit or
incapacitated to exercise control over the child;
or

lives in a brothel or with a prostitute or
frequently visits any place being used for the
purpose of prostitution or is found to associate
with any prostitute or any other person who
leads an immoral or depraved life; or

is being or is likely to be abused or exploited
for immoral or illegal purposes or gain; or

is beyond the parental control; or
is imprisoned with the mother or born in jail;

has lost his parents or one of the parents and has
no adequate source of income; or

is victim of an offence punishable under this
Act or any other law for the time being in force
and his parent or guardian is convicted or
accused for the commission of such offence; Or

is left abandoned by his parent or parents as the
case may be, which will include a child born out
of wedlock and left abandoned by his parent;
7. Keeping the Preamble of the Act in juxtaposition
with the definition of the "Child at risk" as contemplated
under section 2(1)(e) of the Act coupled with the facts
and circumstances of the instant case it could not be
ascertained as to whether the alleged victim, falls under
the definition of "child at risk" or otherwise. In such an
eventuality, the applicability of section 53 of the Act of
2010 as well as Section 511 PPC, to the case of petitioner
is yet a begging question. Wisdom can be derived from

case law reported in 2016 SCMR 1523, 2014 MLD 190
& 2018 YLR Note 114.

8. In such eventuality, when the child did not fall
under the definition of “child at risk’ as provided under
Section 53, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and
Welfare Act, 2010; and when except the solitary
statement of complainant without any medical support,
no other incriminating evidence is available on record to
show any nexus of the accused-petitioner with the
commission of crime, this Court could not withhold the

concession of bail, at least, at this stage.

9. Investigation in the case is complete and accused-
petitioner is no more required to the prosecution for the

very purpose. The accused-petitioner is a minor and in
view of the above stated facts, his case calls for further
inquiry under Sub-Section (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C as
well, therefore, the situation tilts the scales of justice in

favour of bail rather than jail.

10. Apart from the above, it has been held time and
again by the august Supreme Court that bail does not
mean acquittal of accused but only change of custody
from Government agencies to the sureties, who on
furnishing bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to be produced.
Reliance could be placed on case reported in 2008 SCMR
807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

11. Before parting with this order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded
above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of
bail petition and not intended to influence the mind of
trial Court, which is free to appraise the evidence strictly
in accordance with law and merits of the case.

12. For what has been discussed above and on
tentative assessment of material available on file, a case
arguable for the grant of bail is made out. Consequently,
this bail application is allowed and accused-petitioner,
named above, is admitted to bail provided he furnishes

bail bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

13. Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
