25.6.2015 under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997 registered at Police Station A.NF.
Kohat. He has been refused bail by the learned Judge Special
Court (CNS), Peshawar vide his order dated 11.7.2015.

2. Allegation against petitioner is that on 25.6.2015,

3. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as

well as the learned Special Prosecutor for ANF/State and have

gone through the record.

4. Perusal of the record would reveal that the

contraband was recovered from the truck on the pointation of

petitioner, which was being driven by him, hence, keeping in

view the recovery of huge quantity of narcotics weighing

4.800 grams about which report of the FSL is also in the

positive and the offence being non bailable and falls within the

mischief of Section 51 of the CNSA read with 497(1), Cr.PC.,

the petitioner is not entitled to the concession of bail.

5. Recently, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the

case of Socha Gul vs. The State (2015 SCMR 1077) has

held that:
“We have perused the case record and seen
that the offence, for which the petitioner
~ has been charged, falls under section 9 (c)
of CNS Act of 1997, as the quantity of

narcotic substance (charas) recovered from
his possession is four kilograms. The
samples of charas contained in four
packets were separately taken, sealed fn

the spot, and report of Forensic Science
Laboratory has been received in the
positive. In such circumstances, at this
stage no case for grant of bail is made out,
merely for the reason that in the case of
Jamal-ud-Din_ (supra) the honourable two
member Bench of this Court has admitted
the accused to bail with the observation
that, while hearing a petition for grant of
bail, the Court is not to keep in view the
maximum sentence provided by the statute
for the charged offence, but the one which
is likely to be entailed.

From the above reproduction, intent
and scheme of the legislator is quite clear
about the quantum of prescribed
punishment under section 9 (c) (ibid),
which could be either death or
imprisonment for life or an imprisonment
for a term which may extent to fourteen
years, in addition to fine upto one million
rupees. In our opinion, in such
circumstances, neither categorization of
sentencing nor any guess work or
speculative exercise could be undertaken
by the Court at bail stage to enlarge an
accused on bail in such crimes, which will
amount to pre-empting the mind of the trial
Court, controlling its powers in the matter
of sentencing an accused and determining
the quantum of sentence upon his
conviction”.

6. In view of the above, this bail petition, having no a

merit, is dismissed.
