Appellant-Petitioner: Nasir Khan By Mr. M.
Sadeeq Khan, Advocate.

Respondent: By Mr. Shah Hussain

Khan, Advocate, State

By Qudrat Ullah Khan,

A.A.G.
MUHAMMAD YOUNIS  THAHEEM, _J.-
Petitioner Nasir Khan involved in case F.I.R No.
453 dated 19.08.2011, under sections 324/34, of
Police Station Saddar Bannu was refused bail by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-I, Bannu, vide its
order dated 15.12.2015. He has moved this further
application through counsel for his release on bail.
2. The allegations against the accused/
petitioner as per F.I.R referred to above are that on
19.08.2011, he alongwith Qaiser Khan (acquitted

co-accused) duly armed with pistols and in
-2-

furtherance of their common intention attempted at
the life of complainant Qasim Khan and his father
Syed Rehman, by firing at them, as a result,
complainant was hit while his father luckily
remained unscathed. Complainant was shifted to
civil hospital Bannu in injured condition, where he
lodged report. Motive behind the occurrence is
stated to be exchange of hot words inter-se the
complainant and accused few hours prior to the
incident.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that the occurrence has not taken place as
narrated by the complainant. He further argued that
ocular account, site plan and other corroborative
evidence also contradict each other. He went on to
say that the accused/ petitioner deserves to be
released on bail on the basis of further inquiry and
abscondence is not the hurdle in the way of release
of petitioner on bail. He lastly argued that the co-
accused Qaiser Khan having identical role has been
acquitted, was released on bail. hence, on the same
analogy, the present accused/ petitioner deserves to

be released on bail.
-3-

4. Learned Addl: A.G for the state,
assisted by learned counsel for complainant
vehemently opposed the arguments of learned
counsel for petitioner by contending that it is day
light occurrence, parties are of the same village very
known to each other, hence, there is no chance of
misidentification. They further added that the report
has been lodged promptly for attempting at the life
of complainant and his father. They further averred
that recovery memo, site plan, post mortem report
and other corroborative pieces of evidence prima
facie connect the accused/ petitioner with the
commission of offence. They lastly argued that
accused/ petitioner after commission of offence
remained absconder deliberately for a long period of
about four years and waiting for acquittal of co-
accused Qaiser Khan, hence, not entitled for the
concession of bail.

5. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for parties, Addl: A.G for state and perused
the record with their valuable assistance.

6. It appears from the F.I.R that in this
case the occurrence took place on 19.08.2011 at

about 18.00 hours. Qasim Khan is the complainant/
-4-

injured, while Said Rehman is eye-witness of the
present case and the complainant has charged the
accused/ petitioner alongwith acquitted co-accused
Qaiser Khan for commission of offences described
in the FIR with added offence under section 334
PPC.

7. Qaiser Khan co-accused has_ been
acquitted by the learned trial court. Admittedly and
as is evident from the record the occurrence took
place on 19.08.2011 and police conducted house
search of accused on the same date, while accused/
petitioner went abroad on 02.11.2011 after more
than two months of registration of case and house
search, thus remained absconder willfully for a
considerable long period of four years and after
acquittal of his co-accused, he surrendered himself.
If, in the attending circumstances of the case, he is
granted bail merely due to acquittal of co-accused,
then most of the accused would remain fugitive
from law during disposal of the case of their co-

accused. Wisdom is derived from a case law “Atlas

Khan Vs Mazamullah Khan and another” (1989
PCr. LJ_2044 Peshawar), where it is held that the

accused who absconded after the occurrence for
-5-

noticeable period, would not be invariably entitled
to bail merely because his co-accused had been
acquitted in the case.

8. Moreover, the evidence recorded in
absence of accused/ petitioner cannot be taken into
consideration neither at bail stage nor during trial, as
the fate of accused/ petitioner would be decided on
the evidence recoded in his presence. In this respect
case of “Sardar Vs State” (PLD 1979 Peshawar 16,
can favorably be reproduced as below:-

“Accused/ petitioner remaining
outlaw after occurrence for about
eight years and his trial to be held
independently of previous trial
resulting in acquittal of his co-
accused. Contention that other
accused in case having been
acquitted and evidence being same in
both cases, petitioner exonerated
from charge of murder. Held. Not
correct. Acceptance of contention
amounts to examining of witnesses
in petitioner’s case as a matter of
mere formality or there being no
need to examine such witnesses for
reason of such evidence having
already been taken into

consideration in previous case and
-6-

such course not permissible in law.

Bail application rejected.”

9. On merits, tentative assessment would
show that accused/ petitioner is directly charged in
first information report by the complainant; injury
sheet of the complainant, which injury resulted into
amputation of his right foot above his ankle;
recoveries of two empties from the side of accused/
petitioner; motive and ocular account of eye witness
Said Rehman support the complainant version for
commission of offence by the accused/ petitioner,
which falls within the prohibitory clause of section
497 Cr.PC.

10. Moreover, investigation in the case is
complete and trial is ready for commencement in the
near future, but in the meanwhile, case file was
requisitioned by this Court in connection with the
instant petition. Much has been argued before me
from either side, but discussion on all these points
would amount to deeper appreciation of evidence
which has always been deprecated by this court as
well as by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, at bail

stage.
-7-

11. On the face of it, reasonable grounds
exist for believing that the accused/petitioner has
committed an offence, resultantly, the petition for
the grant of bail stands dismissed. However, learned
trial court is directed to conclude the trial within a
period of four months, if not earlier than that.
Announced.
