2010 P Cr. LJ 1806 (Peshawar) "' Zahir Nawaz

and 2 others vs Nazia Bibi and 2 others, 2011

P Cr. LJ 615 (Lahore) Muhammad Riaz alias

2011 MLD 1032 (Lahore) "Muhammad
Zaffar Shah vs the State and another", 2012
MLD 1956 (Sindh) "" Sanwan_ys the State",

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
2009 YLR 2299 (Lahore) '' Muhammad Arif vs
the State and another", 2009 P Cr. LJ 389
(Peshawar) "Muhammad Zakriya and another
vs the State and another", 2012 P Cr.LJ 1883
(Peshawar) "Khan Zada ys the State", 2014
MLD _ 390 (Peshawar) '"" Adil Khan _ys Gul
Nazir_and_ another" and 2012 YLR_ 1903

(Sindh) '"" Muhammad Zahid and another ys

the State. In the light of these dictums of the
Hon'ble Superior Courts prayed for the grant of
bail in favour of the Petitioner. Inversely,
learned counsel for the complainant duly
assisted by the learned Astt: Advocate General
orally argued the stance of the prosecution with
vehemence and prayed for the utter dismissal of

the bail petition.

8. This is not the first act of violence
by the husband this Petitioner against his wife
Mst. Mehnaz who is complainant restraining her
to stay-away from the proceedings in the Family
Court, where the plaint discloses that Mst.
Mehnaz for entitlement of a decree on the basis

of dirty conduct of her husband on the pretext of

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
6
criminal intimidation, calling her names and
severely beaten her, where an FIR No. 248 on
31.03.2017 was registered against the
Petitioner/husband. The matter was patched up
earlier by the compromise, as by that time Mst.
Mehnaz wife of the accused/Petitioner was
given assurance that in future the Petitioner will
not repeat his demeanour, for all the charges
levelled against him yet terms were reduced into
conditions laid down in the agreement. Even
besides the confirmation of the prayers later that
case registered vide FIR No. 248 dated
31.03.2017 after being put in Court also ended
in acquittal. This being the repeated offence the
Petitioner is said to have entered in the house of
his in-laws where in the presence of the mother
and sisters of Mst. Mehnaz his wife, she was
assaulted by using criminal force against her
and with the intention to outrage her modesty.
The medical evidence speaks off that nature of
injury has been termed to have been caused with
blunt weapon of the type of grievous fallen

under the definition of 337 F (vi) of the Pakistan

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
w
it

ow ol

Penal Code, it invites punishment of the daman
and may also be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which may extend
to seven years as ta'zir, which has been defined

as 'Munaqqilah' and is not bailable.

9. There is strong presumption
attached to the judicial documents in the form of
the suit pending against the accused/Petitioner
introduced by his wife the complainant Mst.
Mehnaz for annulment of the Nikah which is a
strong motive. This second attempt for the
repetition of the same offence would tantamount
to exposure of the Petitioner to the act of
barbarism by the desperate husband. Even the
offence committed by the Petitioner would
entail maximum punishment of seven years, the
repetition of the same crime would fall under an

exception for refusal of his bail.

10. This petition has got no force,

which is hereby dismissed.
