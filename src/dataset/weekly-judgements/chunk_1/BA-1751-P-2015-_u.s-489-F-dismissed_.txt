Judgment Sheet

IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT,
PESHAWAR

(Judicial Department)

BA No. 1751-P/2015.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 30.10.2015

Petitioner (Jamal Shah) By Mr. Shakirullah Afridi, Advocate.
State: By Mr. Muhammad Sohail Khan, AAG.

Complainant. By Mr. Abdul Latif Afridi Advocate.

MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J. The
petitioner, Jamal Shah having failed to secure his release
on bail from the Courts below have approached this
Court for seeking the same relief in case FIR No. 479
registered on 14.04.2015 under section 489-F PPC at
Police Station Hayatabad, Peshawar.

2. Brief facts of the case are that respondent No.2/
complainant Haji Tawab Sher reported the matter to the
SHO Police Station Hayatabad in the shape of written
application dated 14.04.2015 to the effect that
accused/petitioner issued a cheque bearing No.1049920

dated 28.02.2015 in the sum of Rs.41, 00, 000/- in lieu
of outstanding amount against him. That upon

presentation of aforesaid cheque to the concerned Bank

for encashment of the said cheque, the same declared

bounced due to insufficient balance in the Bank account

of accused/petitioner. For above bouncing of cheque

upon the said application aforementioned FIR No. 479

was registered.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the

case of petitioner is of further inquiry as allegations

leveled in the FIR would be proved after recording of

evidence as to whether business relations among the

petitioner/accused and complainant existed and actually

cheque was dishonestly issued and has_ been

dishonoured. Secondly matter is pending adjudication

before the learned Political Agent Khyber Agency and is

of civil nature. Thirdly, quantum of sentence for alleged

offence is three years which does not come within the

ambit of prohibitory clause and the petitioner has been

malafidely charged so is squarely entitled for the

concession of bail.
4. On the other hand learned counsel for the private

respondent No.2/complainant argued that though the

offence does not come within the ambit of prohibitory

clause but the case of petitioner is exceptional one as he

is habitual offender, had squeezed money from different

people including complainant and there are so many

other cases registered against him. The other connected

bail petition No.1836-P/2015 pertaining to FIR No.1026

dated 03.08.2015 with Police Station Hayatabad and

similar kind of dispute pending before the learned Court

of Political Agent Khyber Agency is the proof of his

being habitual offender and has repeated the offence. so

the case of petitioner comes within the exception as

envisaged in the famous Tariq Bashir’s case cited as

“PLD 1995 Supreme Court 34” wherein the

Honourable Supreme Court has discussed and

distinguished the exceptions. Secondly, there is every

likelihood of his abscondence and fleeing away from

Pakistan as his son Sajid Ali is already absconding after

defrauding and cheating so many people and fetching
away huge amount of money from complainant who is

accused in criminal case registered vide FIR No. 1026

dated 03.08.2015 for offence u/s 489-F PPC.

Complainant apprehends that petitioner is planning to

leave the country after seeking bail so is not entitled for

the grant of discretionary relief of this Court as well.

5. I have heard both the learned counsel and learned

AAG supported the learned private counsel for

complainant, considered their raised contentions and

perused the record of the instant case and the record of

connected bail petition No.1836-P/2015.

6. From the perusal of record and considering

arguments it reveals that against the present

petitioner/accused two FIRs had been lodged one by the

complainant/respondent No.2 and other by Baghi Sher

about same BA No.1836-P/2015 relating to FIR

No.1026 is also pending adjudication today before this

Court for relief of bail for the offence of same nature.

7. Admittedly, the offence under section 489-

F PPC does not come under the ambit of prohibitory
clause but the offence for which the accused has been

charged is non-bailable offence and the grant of bail in

offences for which punishment is less than ten years is

rule and rejection thereof is an exception to that rule as

laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court in above

referred Tariq Bashir’s case but the instant case has its

own peculiar and exceptional circumstances as

accused/petitioner had issued cheque No.3917836 in the

sum of Rs.11495000/- Muslim Commercial Bank Regi

Lalma which has also been dishonoured for the same

offence another FIR No. 1026 dated 03.08.2015 has

been registered against the petitioner and the learned

Courts below had rejected the bail petition in the same

referred criminal case.

8. From the arguments of both the learned

counsel it reveals that there is pending another case for

the realization of some huge amount before the learned

Court of Political Agent Khyber Agency and against the

same proceeding writ petition has admittedly been filed

before this august Court but none among the parties
provided the certified copies of the same proceedings

either pending before the above said learned Political

Agent or before this august Court. So from the available

record accused/petitioner tentatively seems to be

habitual money squeezer as per allegations, had fetched

huge amount of money from complainant and has

repeated the offence so is connected with the

commission of the offence, hence, his case comes within

the exceptions as discussed in the above cited Tariq

Bashir’s case despite the fact that offence does not come

under the prohibitory clause.

9. So upon the touchstone of above principle

enunciated by the Honourable Supreme Court of

Pakistan in Tariq Bashir’s case as discussed above, the

accused/petitioner is not entitled for the concession of

bail and the learned two Courts below had rightly

exercised their discretion by refusing relief of bail,

hence this petition is rejected. Reliance is placed on the

judgment of Honourable Supreme Court in case titled
“Shameel Ahmad Vs The State” reported as 2009
SCMR 174”.

10. However, it is directed that any observations
recorded in this order, being purely tentative in nature,
should in no way prejudice the proceedings before the
learned trial Court where the case be decided on its own
merit after trial within six months.

Announced:
30.10.2015.
