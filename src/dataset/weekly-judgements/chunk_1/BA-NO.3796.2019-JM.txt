JUDGMENT

EEE

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition, the accused-

petitioner Bilal Jan, has sought his post arrest bail in case FIR
No.864 dated 15,12.2019 u/s 371-AB PPC, registered against
him at P.S. University Town, Peshawar. Same relief was,
however, declined to him by the learned Trial Court vide order
dated 21.12.2019.

2. Brief facts of the case, as per FIR, are that the
complainant Wali Khan, SI, alongwith other police officials
including a lady constable, pursuant to general complaints
regarding prostitution and selling/buying of girls for the
purpose thereof, raided the place of occurrence; apprehended
two girls and two boys, including the present petitioner, from
there in objectionable condition with certain incriminating
articles, All the accused were arrested and on the basis of
murasila, the FIR ibid was registered against them.

3. | Arguments heard and record gone through.

4. It was the story of prosecution that there were general
complaints regarding prostitution in the said plaza, but, record

is silent about such complaints. Besides, no statement of the
owner of the plaza has been recorded so as to substantiate the
stance of the complainant, at least, at this stage.

5. The allegations, as spelt out from the FIR and the offence
for which the petitioner is charged require further inquiry,
because Section 371-AB PPC provides selling/buying persons
for the purpose of prostitution while the petitioner is shown
merely present in objectionable condition alongwith a girl.
Presently there is nothing on record in the shape of any
confession, so as to ascertain whether above section of law
could be applied to his case or otherwise. Besides, there is no
medical report of accused _ available on record to support the
version of complainant.

6. The petitioner, after initial remand, has already been sent
to the judicial lock up and he is no more required for further
investigation. No doubt, in similar situation, this court in the
cases of Mst. Kainat Vs. State (2016 YLR 974) and Salman
Ghazanfar Vs. The State (2018 MLD 1446) has granted bail.
The co-accused in the instant case has already been granted bail
by the learned Trial Court vide order dated 21.12.2019.

7. In addition, it was observed that no search warrant has
been obtained from the learned Judicial Magistrate; and having
not done so, the case of petitioner would require further inquiry
as required by Sub-Section(2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C. entitling
the accused to the concession of bail.

8. For the reasons stated above and on tentative assessment

of material available on file, a case arguable for the grant of
bail, is made out. Consequently, this petition is allowed and the
petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in
the sum of Rs.100,000/- with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa/Duty Magistrate.
The local status and financial strength of the sureties shall be
ensured before admission of bail bonds.

9. These are the detailed reasons of short order of even date.
