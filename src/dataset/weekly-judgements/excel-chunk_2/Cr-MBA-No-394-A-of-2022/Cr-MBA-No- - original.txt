KAMRAN HAYAT MIANKHEL, J.-. This petition

has been moved on behalf of the petitioner
namely Zeeshan Hafeez son of Muhammad
Hafeez for admitting him to post-arrest bail till the
final conclusion of the trial in case FIR No.365
dated 07.04.2022 registered under sections
279/322 PPC at the police station, Havelian
District Abbottabad.

2. The prosecution case set up as per the FIR
is that the petitioner while driving Suzuki bearing
registration No.1124/Bannu in rash and negligent
manner ran over Muhammad Muzammil, as result
whereof he lost his life. The petitioner was placed
under arrest on 17.05.2022. Vide order dated
25.05.2022 his post-arrest bail was declined by
the learned Additional Sessions Judge,

Abbottabad at Havelian, hence, this petition.
3. Despite date by court none appeared
on behalf of the complainant. Arguments of
learned counsel for the petitioner as well as
learned Assistant Advocate General heard and
record gone through with their valuable
assistance.
4. Perusal of record reveals that section
279 PPC bailable and punishment for qatl-bis-
sabab provided under Section 322, P.P.C., is
‘Diyat' only. According to Section 53, P.P.C., an
offender, upon having been found guilty of the
charge, may be imposed upon any one or more
out of the punishments of Qisas, Diyat, Arsh,
Daman, Death either as Qisas or Ta‘zir,
Imprisonment for Life, Forfeiture of Property and
Fine by a Court of competent jurisdiction.
Furthermore, under Section 299(e), Chapter XVI
of P.P.C., Diyat has been defined as the
compensation specified in Section 323, P.P.C.,
payable to the heirs of the victim and the value of
Diyat has been defined in Section 323, P.P.C., as
under:-

"(1) The Court shall, subject to

the Injunctions of Islam as laid

down in the Holy Qur'an and

Sunnah and keeping in view

the financial position of the

convict and the heirs of the

victim, fix the value of diyat
which shall not be less than the
value of thirty thousand, six
hundred and thirty grams of
silver.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), the Federal
Government shall, by
Notification in the official
Gazette, declare the value of
silver, on the first day of July
each year or on such date as it
may deem fit, which shall be
the value payable during a
financial year."

5. In the judgment reported as Muhammad
Shafi v. The State and another (2020 PCr.LJ
1530), has observed that in such like cases it is
for the learned trial Court to hold at the trial that
whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution
would bring the case of accused within the ambit
of Section 322, P.P.C., or otherwise; no
punishment of any period, except the payment of
Diyat, has been provided under Section 322,
P.P.C., and no express provision of law exists to
show that punishment of Diyat attracts the
prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C.
Furthermore, in the case of Israr Hussain Shah
v. The State and 2 others (2020 PCr.LJ 1164),
has held that if a provision can be interpreted in
two different manners then the one which favours
the accused is to be adopted; an accused handed

down guilty verdict under Section 322, P.P.C. can
only be kept in confinement, if he makes a default
to pay the Diyat amount as is evident from
Section 331, P.P.C. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
of Pakistan in the dictum reported as Shah
Hussain v. The State (PLD 2009 SC 460) has
held that after the use of word "shall" for the word
"may" in Section 382-B, Cr.P.C, at the time of
passing the sentence it is mandatory for the trial
Court to take into consideration the pre-sentence
custody period of the accused. The apex court in
judgment reported as 2022 SCMR 515, has held

that:-

“From the contents of the crime
report, it appears that an
offence of qatl-bis-sabab
punishable under section 322,
P.P.C. is made out other than
qatl-i-khata punishable under
section 319, P.P.C. However,
qatl-i-amd under section 302
does not appear to be made
out in the present facts and
circumstances of the case.
Section 322, P.P.C. _ falls
outside the prohibitory clause of
section 497(1), Cr.P.C.1 while
section 319, P.P.C. is bailable.”

6. Keeping in view the above legal position, it
can safely be held that if an accused charged
under Section 322, P.P.C., upon pleading his
guilty or after his trial, is convicted accordingly, he

can only be kept in confinement in case he

commits default in the payment of Diyat amount
and the provision of Section 382-B, Cr.P.C does
not apply in such like case, which ordains that
"Where a Court decides to pass a sentence of
imprisonment on an accused for an offence, it
shall take into consideration the period, if any,
during which such accused was detained in
custody for such offence". As such, incarceration
of the petitioner during trial would amount to
punishment before his conviction which is against
the mandate of law vis-a-vis applicability of
Section 382-B, Cr.P.C settled by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the dictum supra.
Moreover, it is settled law that in an offence which
does not entail the punishment of imprisonment
the accused shall be entitled to bail as of right
because if he is refused bail the period as under
trial prisoner would amount to a case of double

jeopardy.

7. Keeping in view the above legal
position, it can safely be held that incarceration of
the petitioner as under trial prisoner is not justified
as the same would not serve any useful purpose
and even in case of his conviction such period
cannot be compensated in any manner.
Therefore, by allowing this petition, the petitioner

is admitted to post-arrest bail subject to his
furnishing of bail bond in the sum of Rs.1,00,000/-
(Rupees one lac only) with two sureties in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the learned of Illaqa /
Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that
the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
These are the detailed reasons of the
order of even date.
