REKKKE
JUDGMENT

KR

IJAZ ANWAR, J. This Bail Application has been filed
by the accused/petitioner Irfan s/o Rehmat and is seeking
his release on bail in case FIR No.736 dated 07.06.2021
under Section 11-C KPCNSA at Police Station Gulbahar,
District Peshawar, wherein, he is charged for the recovery
of 1050 grams of ICE from his personal possession.

2. Learned counsel for the accused/petitioner
argued that case of the accused is a border line case and
according to him, Section 9 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 2019 (hereinafter to be
referred as “the Act of 2019”) will be applicable and as per
Section 9(c) of “the Act of 2019”, the case of the accused

does not come within the prohibitory clause of Section 497
Page 2 of 6

Cr.P.C. He further argued that as per the FSL report, the
recovered substance is proved to be amphetamine and as
such, Section 11 of “the Act of 2019” is not applicable to
the case of the accused/petitioner.

3. On the other hand, the learned AAG
representing the State opposed the arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/petitioner and contended that
amphetamine is from the same family of methamphetamine.
He further argued that being locally manufactured,
amphetamine is a most dangerous drug. The chemical
examiner present in Court also supported the arguments of
the learned AAG, however, remained unable to distinguish
amphetamine with the methamphetamine. He, however,
admitted that both have separate chemical formulas. He

further stated that amphetamine is included in

methamphetamine.
4. Arguments heard. Record perused.
5. Prior to the promulgation of “the Act of 2019”

the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 (Act No.XXV
of 1997) (hereinafter to be referred as “the Act of 1997”)
was in the field; however, after the promulgation of “the
Act of 2019”, “the Act of 1997” was repealed to the extent
of cultivation, possession, selling, purchasing, delivery and
transportation etc. within the province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa. However, so far as I understand, the aim and

object of “the Act of 2019” was to provide for strict

Page 3 of 6

punishments for the newly introduced drugs duly find its
mention in the Schedule attached to “the Act of 2019”. The
main issue before this Court is whether the recovery of
amphetamine (chemical name (+/-)-a-methypenethylamine)
can be punished under Section 9 or Section 11 of “the Act
of 2019”. In Section 2(aj) of “the Act of 2019”,
“psychotropic substance” is defined as under:-

“Psychotropic substance means the substance,
specified in the Schedule appended to this Act
and such substances as Government may, by
notification in the official Gazette, declare to be

a psychotropic substance”.

Similarly, in Section 9 of “the Act of 2019”,
punishments have also been provided for “psychotropic
substance” and at the same time, Section 11(a) has also
provided different punishments in view of the quantity of
methamphetamine; while, as referred to above, in the
Schedule, methamphetamine is also mentioned and is
included in “psychotropic substance” in accordance with the
definition given to it under Act ibid, for which punishment
is also provided under Section 9(a) of “the Act of 2019”. In
order to clarify this anomaly, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotics Substances (Second Amendment) Act,
2020 (hereinafter to be referred as “the Second Amendment
Act, 2020”) was introduced. In Section 9, sub-section (1),
clause (a), after the words “psychotropic substance”, the

words “except methamphetamine” was inserted; similarly, a

Page 4 of 6

proviso was also added to clause (a) in the following
words:-

“Provided that offences relating to or involving
methampahetamine, as provided in section 10,
shall be dealt in accordance with Section 11 of

this Act; or”

6. There is no cavil with the proposition that the
psychotropic substance as mentioned in the Schedule to “the
Act of 2019” also includes amphetamine at S.No.1 with its
international non-proprietary name; while
methamphetamine is mentioned at S.No.40 of the Schedule
with its non-proprietary or trival name as ICE/Chalk/
Crystal. In view of “the Second Amendment Act, 2020”,
methamphetamine is completely distinguished from other
psychotropic substance for the purpose of punishment and
as per the added proviso, only Sections 10 and 11 will now
deal with the offences relating to methamphetamine.
Section 10 “of the Act of 2019” provides for “prohibition of
methamphetamine”, as under:-

10. Prohibition of methamphetamine.---No one
shall produce, manufacture, extract, prepare,
possess, offer for sale, sell, purchase, distribute,
deliver on any terms whatsoever, transport,
dispatch, methamphetamine, except for medical,
Scientific or industrial purposes in the manner
and subject to such conditions, as may be

specified by Government.

While the punishment is provided under Section 11 “of
the Act of 2019” for the contravention of the provisions of

Section 10, which is reproduced as under:-

11. Punishment for contravention of section 10:

Whoever, contravenes the provisions of section 10

shall be punished with-
(a) imprisonment, upto seven (07) years and
shall also be liable to fine not less than rupees
three (03) lac, if the quantity of
methamphetamine does not exceed 100
grams;
(b) imprisonment, not less than ten (10) years
and shall also be liable to fine not less than
rupees five (05) lac, if the quantity of
methamphetamine exceeding 100 grams, but
does not exceed one (01) kilogram;
(c) death, imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for a term which may extend
upto fourteen (14) years and with a fine which
may extend to rupees one (01) million, if the
quantity of methamphetamine exceeds one
(01) kilogram;

7. In the case in hand, 1050 grams of
amphetamine is shown recovered from the accused/
petitioner. Similarly, when the recovered substance was sent
to the FSL and it was subjected to physical and chemical

analysis, its test revealed the sample as ‘amphetamine’.

Thus, in view of the clear wordings “of the Act of 2019”,
amphetamine being declared as psychotropic substance: as
such, its punishment will be dealt with under the provisions

of Section 9 “of the Act of 2019”. (Underline provided for emphasis)

8. Now coming to the case of the accused/
petitioner. In terms of Section 9(d) “of the Act of 2019”, if
the quantity of narcotic substance exceeds the limit of 01
KG, the punishment provided is death, imprisonment for
life or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 14
years and with fine, which may extend to Rs.1 Million and
not less than Rs.5 lac. The case of the accused/petitioner is,
thus, hit by the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C;
besides, as demonstrated by the Chemical Examiner before
this Court that amphetamine is also a controlled drug and
being locally manufactured, it is a most dangerous to the
human health and as per recent studies, the group who are
most at risk of abusing amphetamine are colleges,
universities’ students and young boys. As such, I am not
inclined to consider the argument that it being a border line
case for the purpose of bail.

9. For the reasons stated above, this Bail
Application fails. Accordingly, it stands dismissed.
