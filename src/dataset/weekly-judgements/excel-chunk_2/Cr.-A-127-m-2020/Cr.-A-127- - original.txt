Bacha Umar and Nasar were alleged to have been
waiting for the main accused i.e. appellant, while
boarding their motorcycle who had also taken

@

guilty and claimed trial. Prosecution was invited to

produce evidence, who accordingly examined

thirteen (13) witnesses and closed its evidence.

Statements of the accused were recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C. The accused/appellant desired
to produce evidence in his defénce while rest of the
two accused neither opted to record statements in .
their defence nor-wished to produce evidence. The
appellant accordingly examined Malak Muhammad

DW-2. On conclusion of proceedings in trial,

accused/respondents namely Nasar Khan and
Bad Shah Umar.

NAWAB , {D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5. Learned counsel for appellant
submitted during the course of his arguments that
it was not usual for a lady to accompany male
members. of his family for attending Court
proceedings, particularly when no case of her
own had been pending in Courts. He also referred
to the statement of doctor wherein he has stated
that he had examined the deceased about 01:00 P.M
on 27.08.2018 and then drew attention ‘of this
Court towards the time of occurrence given in the
‘Murasila’ Ex. PA as 13:00 hours. He argued that
the time of occurrence had wrongly been shown.
as 13:00 hours which had in-fact been the time of
examination of the deceased and this fact makes -
presence of the PW further doubtful, beside
making the mode and manner of commission of
the offence questionable. Regarding recovery of
blood stained Burga of the eyewitness the learned
counsel stated that same had been recovered on
28.08.2018 i.e. on second day of the occurrence
and therefore not reliable. He also added that
another eyewitness of the prosecution have
disowned witnessing the occurrence during the

course of his cross-examination and therefore

NAWAB (D.8) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
said fact had shattered the whole case of
prosecution. Regarding the recovery of sveapon
of offence, the leamed counsel stated that the
appellant had himself surrendered before the
police as is evident from statements of DW-1
as well as DW-2 but the local police had instead
shown him arrested from a place near the police
station along with a pistol and therefore recovery .
of the pistol from accused/appellant was not
believable at all. In order to bolster his
arguments, learned counsel placed reliance on the
judgments reported as 1998 SCMR 279, 1999
SCMR_ 1220, 1997 P_Cr.EJ 2075 and 1990 P
Cr.L J 2042,

6. Learned counsel for complainant
submitted in rebuttal that the lady had ‘come to
meet her brother namely Hidayat Ullah who had
been facing a murder trial, while being in custody
and as such the prosecution have been able to
establish presence of the PW. Learned counsel
also added. that . statement’ of the lady had
remained unshaken during the course of cross-
examination, whose statement was sufficient for
maintaining the conviction. The learned counsel

NAWAB (D.B) Hon‘ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
also added that statement of the complainant had
fully been confidence inspiring. He further stated
that existence of motive has also been established
as Hidayat Ullah another brother of the
complainant had been facing trial in a triple
murder case, FIR in respect of which had also
been brought in evidence as Ex. PW-13/12. The
deceased therein was claimed to be near relative
of the appellant and therefore motive for
commission of the offence had stood established
on record according to the learned counsel. He
placed reliance on the judgments reported as
PLD _ 1980 Supreme Court 225, 2001 'SCMR
177, 2008 SCMR 917, 2011 SCMR_ 1394, 2011
SCMR 725, 1988 P Cr.LJ 1523, 2013 P CrLJ
692, 2012 P Cr. LJ 1274, 2013YLR 1215 and
2014 P Cr. LJ 374, The learned Astt: AG. for
State adopted the arguments of learned counsel
for complainant and supported the impugned
judgment in respect of the conviction recorded
as well as the sentence of capital punishment
awarded to the appellant.

7. We have heard arguments of

learned counsel for the parties, learned Astt: A.G

NAWAB * (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
a
appearing on behalf of State and perused the
record.

8. " Perusal of record reveals that
mainstay of the prosecution case has been -
statement of the complainant namely Mst. Jehan
Sultan recorded as PW-11. She has stated in her
examination-in-chief that she along with her
deceased brother had been returning from District
Courts Timergara and when they reached the
place of occurrence her brother went towards: a
pushcart vendor for purchasing fruits. Appellant |
along with other two co-accused was stated to
have come, de-boarded from the motorcycle and
fired at the deceased then alive with his pistol, as
a result of which he had fallen down on the
ground and died at the spot. Previous blood feud
enmity was stated to have been motive and cause
of the occurrence. This witness has . been
subjected to the test of cross-examination but she
has remained firm in her statement and nothing
beneficial to the case of defence could be brought
out from her mouth. She has also stated in her
examination-in-chief as well as in her cross-
examination that she had come to the Courts so

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq !brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-10-

as to meet her incarcerated brother namely
Hidayat Ullah. It is admitted that Hidayat Ullah
had been facing a murder trial in which a date of
hearing was fixed that very day. Prosecution have
also brought on record order sheets showing
proceedings of the Court — taking place on the
relevant day i.e. 27.08.2018 — as Ex. PW-13/14.
She has also stated that they reached the Court
_ premises at approximately 09:00 A.M and left the
premises at about 12:30 PM. This witness has
successfully stood the test of cross-examination
whose presence had also remained established by
the prosecution. Regarding her presence, a
question had also been asked from doctor namely
Abshar Ahmad who had conducted postmortem :
examination of the deceased, while he was being
cross-examined as PW-7. He had replied that
when the dead body had been brought to the
hospital it was being accompanied by Amir Zada
and sister of the deceased as well as'members of
the local police. The Investigating Officer had also
taken in possession the blood stained Burga worn
by the lady at the time of occurrence vide recovery

memo Ex. PW-1/1. In support of the recovery

NAWAB {D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-ll-

‘memo prosecution had examined Shah Zameen,

ASI as PW-1 and the Investigating Officer
namely Gul Zameen Khan Inspector also deposed
in support thereof as PW-13. The Burga along
with blood soaked earth and blood stained
garments of the deceased had been sent to FSL
for chemical analysis wherein the report Ex. PW-
13/38 had also been received and produced in
evidence showing that all the three items had
been containing human blood and of the same
group. This piece of evidence had given an added
vigor to the case of prosecution vis-a-vis
presence of the PW at the place of occurrence.
The assertion of learned counsel for appellant
that the Burga had been taken in possession on
the second day of occurrence and therefore not
reliable, was divested of any force, Complainant
was a Pardnasheen lady wearing a Burqa at the
time of occurrence and thereafter in the hospital,
which could not be taken off, unless the lady had
gone back to her house. It is also understandable
that 13:00 hours was the time of occurrence and
the lady had also accompanied dead body to the
hospital, so after return to her house along with

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-12-

the dead body it would have been substantially
late and it was the day following i.e. 28.08.2018
that the Burga had been handed over to the
Investigating Officer. On the date of recovery of
the blood stained Burga, dead body of the
deceased would have been buried, Matching of
the blood stained on the Burga with samples
collected from the spot has therefore further
fortified the case of prosecution vis-a-vis
presence of the PW on the spot.
9. So far as the other witness namely |
Anwar Shehzad is concerned, he has resiled from
his testimony while deposing in Court as PW-6.
He was also declared hostile witness and was
cross-examined by the defence side. This witness
had not-been cited as an eyewitness by the
complainant in the FIR. His testimony even if he
had not resiled would not have been of much
worth for the prosecution. When he had resiled
from his statement and has been declared as
hostile, he cannot be considered to be a witness
for and in support of the case of defence or the
prosecution, It was laid ‘down by Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Dr.

NAWAB (D.B) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-13-

Javaid Akhtar v/s The State” reported as PLD

2007 Supreme Court 249 that a Court would be
justified in ignoring statement of a hostile
witness. Relevant part of observations of the
august Court is reproduced hereunder for ready
reference;

“It is admitted fact that P. W.13 Khurshid Ali was
declared hostile, therefore, both the Courts below were
justified to ignore his statement. See Parita's case 47
Cr.LJ 232 and Habibullah's case PLD 1969 SC 127.

Further reliance in this respect may
also be placed on the judgments of Hon’ble Apex
court reported as 1995 SCMR1144 as well as PL D

2007 Supreme Court 223.

10. Statement of a solitary eyewitness is
sufficient for maintaining conviction provided it
is confidence inspiring. In the case of “Farooq

Khan v/s The State” reported as 2008 SCMR

917, Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan had

observed in this respect;

“As to the argument of learned counsel for the
appellant that the solitary statement of injured
P.W.8 was the basis of conviction, suffice it to
observe that the injured prosecution witness had
given the number of injuries caused to the
deceased’ in the incident by attributing the
responsibility to the appellant. Evidence of this
witness has been c supported by medical evidence
furnished by Dr.. Muhammad Magsood P.W.6
who conducted post-mortem exaniination on the
dead body of the deceased Zahir Khan. The
evidence of injured witness is worthy of credence,

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-14-

independent and natural and there was no lawful
justifiable cause to discard his evidence. The
credence of statement of solitary witness has
already been examined by this Court in a number
of cases. In this context reference can be made to
Mali v. The State 1969 SCMR 76; Muhammad
Ashraf v. The State 1971 SCMR 530, Muhammad _
Siddique alias Ashraf alias Achhi and 3 others v.
The State 1971 SCMR 659 and Muhammad
Mansha v. The State 2001 SCMR 199. Moreover,

conviction _in any murder case can be based on
the testimony of a single witness, if the Court is
Satisfied that the witness is reliable. In other
words, the "emphasis" is on quality of evidence,
and not on its quantity. In this behalf reliance can
be placed on the case of Allah Bakhsh v. Shammi
PLD 1980S C 225, “

“emphasis supplied”
Similar observations had also been

recorded by Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of

“Shamshad Ali v/s The State” reported -as 2011

SCMR 1394 in the following words;

“The place of occurrence admittedly was the
house of the complainant and the appellant,
‘therefore the complainant was a natural witness.
After her examination-in-chief, she was subjected
to lengthy cross. examination but nothing in
favour of the appellant came out in the same. The
complainant had no motive to falsely implicate the
appellant in the present case. Her statement is
confidence inspiring and solitary statement
coming out of the mouth of a natural witness,
even if it is not corroborated by any independent
Piece of evidence, is sufficient to bring home the
guilt of the accused.

Further reliance in this respect may
also be placed on the judgment of Hon’ble Apex

Court given in the case of “Niaz-ud-Din and

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq !brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-15-

another v/s The State” reported as 2011SCMR
Witness in the. case in hand had
been found fully consistent with her first
narration, medico-legal evidence. Her statement
had also been ‘getting support from recovery of
blood soaked earth from the spot and the fact that
the spot of occurrence had not been seriously
disputed by the prosecution. Report had also been
lodged by her with reasonable promptitude i.e.
after 30 minutes of the occurrence, in the hospital
and in presence of dead body of the deceased.
Her address indicates that she had been resident
of a different Tehsil, and procuring her
attendance in a short span of thirty minutes from
her house would have been very difficult, had she
been not present on the spot. No reason exists as
to why should testimony of this eyewitness, be
discarded. |
11. Report of the  medico-legal
examination of the deceased Ex. PW-7/1 also
reveals that the dead body was carrying a single
, firearm injury at his head, and therefore goes in
synchronization with the assertion of complainant

NAWAB (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiaar Ahmad
-16-

given while lodging her first report. The doctor
has also testified-in support thereof as PW-7.
During his cross-examination nothing beneficial
to the case of appellant could be brought out from
his mouth. Case of the prosecution stood fully
established on the force of statement of a reliable
eyewitness and the requisite corroboration for her
statement has also been forthcoming.

12. The weapon of offence has ‘also
been recovered from the appellant at the time of
his arrest. APW-12 Rauf Khan JHC and
Investigating Officer namely Gul Zameen Khan
C.1.0 PW-13 were examined in support thereof .
whose testimony have remained consistent. The
defence side has though examined DW-1 and
DW-2 in support of their assertions that the
appellant had not been arrested in the mode and
manner shown in the instant case, but had rather
been handed*over. to local police by elders of the
locality. During the course of cross-examination
of DW-1 has stated that he had been belonging to
same village to which the appellant belonged.
The deceased had been belonging to another

village namely Safray. This person was also a

NAWAB {0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice tshtlaq Ibrahim
Hon’bie Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-17-

political figure who would be needing services of
the appellant’s family for political purposes, and
as such his testimony is not entirely reliable.
Similarly, DW-2 has also stated in his cross-
examination that he had been working as driver
with Malak Muhammad Zaib Khan (DW-1) since
12 years. This witness had also shown ignorance
about the exact date of handing over of the
appellant to local police, therefore his statement
is also of no worth to the prosecution. The
evidence of the defence regarding handing over
of the appellant to the local police, voluntarily, is
therefore not credible and reliable.

13. So far as the quantum of sentence
awarded to the appellant is concerned, it is
important to be noted that he had fired a single
fire shot at the deceased at the time of
occurrence. The minor weaknesses in evidence
of prosecution may not be taken’ as a.
justification for the outright acquittal of the
appellant, but such weaknesses may be
considered for reduction of the sentence as held

by Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its

NAWAB. (0.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag brahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
-18-

judgment rendered in the case of “ Falak Sher

ws The State” reported as 1999 SCMR 2432,

wherein the Hon’ble Court had taken into
account minor inconsistencies existing in the
case of prosecution as a reason for reduction of
death sentence of an accused to life

imprisonment by observing;

“In the overall circumstances of the case, where
motive had become suspect and where the
prosecution version suffers from inconsistencies,
other than of a fatal character, it appears proper
not to resort to the death penalty, touching the
guilt of the accused. For such reasons, this appeal
is partly allowed converting the capital
punishment, awarded by the High Court, into life
imprisonment coupled with -fine and identical
provisions, as to distribution of compensation
under section 544-A, Cr.P.C., returned by the trial
Court together with the benefit of section 382-B,
of the same Code,” |

Similarly, in the case of

“Muhammad Riaz and another v/s The State &

another” reported as 2007 SCMR_ 1413 the
Hon’ble Apex Court had converted the sentence
of death to life imprisonment by holding that;

“No doubt, normal penalty for an act of
commission of Qatl-i- Amd provided under law is
death, but since life imprisonment also being a
legal sentence for such offence must be kept in
mind wherever the facts and circumstances
warrant mitigation of sentence, because no hard:
and fast rule can be applied in each and every
case.”

NAWAB (0.8) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
-19-.

Further reliance in this respect
may also be placed on the judgments of |
Hon’ble Apex Court reported as 1980 SCMR
859, 2008 SCMR 984, 2009 SCMR_1188
as well as 2020 SCMR 1214.

In the case in hand also the slight
variation in time of - ‘the occurrence
as well as time of examination of the dead body
and the fact that one of the prosecution
witnesses had gone hostile while another
witness though claimed by the prosecution to
have seen ‘the occurrence, had not been
examined, are such circumstances benefit of
which should go to the appellant in
determination of quantum of his sentence.

14, For what has been discussed
above, we partially allow the instant appeal and
reduce the sentence of death to that of life
imprisonment under section 302 (b) PPC. Rest
of the sentences awarded by learned trial Court
through the impugned judgment shall remain
intact. Benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C is also

extended to the appellant. Murder Reference

No. 03-M/2020 sent by learned trial Court to
this Court is accordingly answered in
“negative”.

15. As far as connected criminal appeal
filed by complainant against acquittal of
co-accused. Nasar Khan and Bad Shah Umar
Khan is concerned, it is important to be noted that
both the accused/respondents had been assigned
the role of presence on the spot and helping the
appellant. They were alleged to have come to the
spot of occurrence in the company of principal
accused Subhan Ullah while boarding a
motorcycle. The principal accused Subhan Ullah
was alleged to have de-boarded from the
motorcycle and fired at the deceased with his
pistol and to have decamped ‘from the spot on
said motorcycle after commission of the offence.
Prosecution have though been claiming to have
recovered the motorcycle on pointation of one of
the accused namely Nasar Khan vide recovery:
memo Ex. PW-2/1 but it is important that the
complainant while lodging report of the
occurrence had not mentioned any registration

number of the motorcycle. No evidence was led

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtlaq tbrahim
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
+21-

in support of the fact that whether it had in-fact
been same motorcycle which had been used in
commission of the offence. Besides the charge, to
the extent of these two co-accused for abetting
commission of the offence appears to be
exaggerated for the reason that even if the
principal accused was to be facilitated he could
have been facilitated by a single rider of
‘Motorcycle and there had not been a need for
putting an extra person on the motorcycle, just
for facilitating the principal accused and playing
no other role in commission of the offence.
Besides they had neither been stated to have been
armed with firearms:at the time of commission of
the offence, nor had any weapon been recovered
from their possession, or on their pointation.
Going for an offence of murder, to the very spot ©
of occurrence, without any arms even for the
purpose of abetting, does not stand to reason. The
above-mentioned two co-accused/respondents
have rightly been given benefit of doubt by the
learned trial Court through the impugned
judgment. Besides they have earned a double
presumption of innocence with earning of an

NAWAB (D.B) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ishtiag Ibrahim
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Wiqar Ahmad
aR

+22 -

order of acquittal from the teamed trial Court and
the reasons for reversal of such order has not
been forthcoming so far as case of the acquitted
accused/respondents are concerned. Reliance in
this is placed on judgments of Hon’ble Apex
Court rendered in the case of “Ghulam Sikandar

and_another v/s Mamaraz Khan and others”

reported as “1985 SCMR_ 11”, the case of

“Muhammad Iqbal V/s Abid Hussain alias

Mithu and _6 others” reported as 1994 SCMR
1928 and the case of “The State through A.G.

v/s Mehmood Khan and others” reported as

“2007 SCMR 1390”. Criminal Appeal No. 141-

M of 2020 filed by complainant against acquittal _ -

of accused/respondents namely Nasar Khan and

mentioned above.
