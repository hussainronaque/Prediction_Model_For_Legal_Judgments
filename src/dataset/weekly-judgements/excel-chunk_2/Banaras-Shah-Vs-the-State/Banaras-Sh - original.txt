JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Banaras Shah, being abortive to get the concession of bail
from the two Courts below, through this further petition,
seeks the same concession from this Court in case FIR
No.150 dated 04.04.2015, registered under sections 302/34
PPC, in Police Station Topi, District Swabi, wherein he
alongwith absconding co-accused is charged for
committing the ‘qatl-i-amd’ of Abdul Hakeem Shah
deceased with firearm on 04.04.2015 at 11.30 hours.
Verbal altercation/ quarrel between the parties, during
which course the incident took place, has been alleged as
motive behind and in addition to complainant Zubair Shah,
the incident is stated to have been witnessed by PW Sohaib
Shah.

2. Arguments heard and record perused.

3. It appears from the record that about the same
incident another FIR No.151 dated 04.04.2015 under
section 324 PPC, in same Police Station Topi Swabi, has
also been registered on the report of one Maqsood Ali Shah
wherein Sohaib Shah, e eyewitness of the instant FIR, has
been charged for attempting at the life of complainant
Magsood Ali Shah and causing him firearm injury. Oral
altercation/ quarrel between the parties has also been
alleged as motive behind the incident. In the instant case,
Syed Abdul Hakeem Shah has lost his life while in FIR
No.151 of the even date and of same Police Station,
Magsood Ali Shah has been shown injured, which injury
has not been declared by the Medical Officer to be self
inflicted or artificial. As evident from autopsy report of
deceased Syed Abdul Hakeem Shah, he too, has sustained
single firearm injury, which caused his death. So from both
the sides, single injury has been caused to single person,
but in the instant case the single injury resulted in death of
Syed Abdul Hakeem Shah. When both the FIRs are taken
in juxtaposition, the date, time and venue of occurrence as
well as parties are the same, thus, the incident falls within
the definition of cross version. Sohaib Shah accused of
cross FIR has been already granted bail by this Court,

though not on the ground of cross version, as the same was

not alleged by him nor was it brought into the notice of this
Court at that time. However, as discussed above, the
incident has been established to be that of counter versions.
The prime consideration in cross version cases is as to who
the aggressor was and who was aggressed upon and not the
injuries caused to one side only or that the loss/ damage
caused to one party is greater than caused to the other,
which is only a relevant factor and does not have
overriding effect. In this view of the matter, who has acted
in self defence and who has attacked, is a matter of further
inquiry, on the basis of which the petitioner is found
entitled to the concession of bail in light of the dictum laid
down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled,
“Muhammad Shahzad Siddique Vs the State and
another” (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 58” which runs as
under:-

“Cases of counter-versions arising from the

same incident, one given by the complainant in

FIR and the other given by the opposite party,

are covered for grant of bail on the ground of

further inquiry as contemplated under section

497 (2) Cr.P.C. Bail in such cases is normally

granted on the ground of further inquiry

because question s to which version is correct

is to be determined by the trial Court after
appraising the evidence recorded by it, for
reaching the final conclusion in this regard.
Plea of private defence is normally taken in
case of counter-versions giving rise to question
as to which party has acted in aggression and
which party is an aggressed one”.
Same view has been reiterated by the Apex Court in case
titled, “Abdul Hameed Vs Zahid Hussain alias Papu
Chaman Patiwala and others” (2011 SCMR 606) in
these words:-
“We have gone through both the FIRs and find
that incident of both the FIRs took place on
27.09.2009 at 2. a.m. The place of incident of
both the cases has also been shown on footpath
comer of Street No.6-B Suleman Azad Road,
New Kalri Karachi. From this position it is
prima clear that the incidents of both the FIRs
took place on the same date, time and place.
However, this point can be properly thrashed
out at the time of trial but presently no
exception can be taken with regard to the said
position. We have also examined both the FIRs

and find that no tentative findings could be

given as to which party is aggressor therefore
in the circumstance the High Court was
justified in granting the bail to the respondents.
The impugned order does not suffer from any
illegality or irregularity as such it does not
require any interference. The petition is
dismissed. Leave refused”.
The aforesaid view has been re-affirmed by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case titled, “Hamza Ali Hamza and
others Vs the State” (2010 SCMR 1219), in the
following words:-
“We have heard both the Advocate Supreme
Courts and the learned Additional Prosecutor
General, Sindh and perused the record with
their assistance. Upon perusal of both FIRs,
loged by the parties against each other, it
would appear that a free fight ensured between
them in which hatchets and Lathis were used.
Consequently, two persons from the
petitioner’s side and one person from the
complainant side received injuries. Though
Sambhoo from the complainant side had been
greviously injured and perhaps the other two

persons from the petitioners side had received

minor injuries, it is difficult to ascertain at this

stage as to who was the aggressor.

Consequently, it would be unjust to refuse bail

to the petitioners, particularly, when all the

other from the complainant side are on bail”.
4. Deriving wisdom from the judgments of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court (supra), this petition is allowed.
Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail, provided he
furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
local, reliable and resourceful sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/MOD, concerned.
