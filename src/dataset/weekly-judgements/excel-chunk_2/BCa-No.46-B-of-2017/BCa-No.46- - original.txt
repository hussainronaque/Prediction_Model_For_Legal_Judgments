State By Shahid Hameed Addl: AG.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.-- Through instant Cr. Misc:/ B.C.A

No. 46-B of 2017, the petitioner Hikmatullah seeks cancellation

of bail granted to the accused/ respondent Faiz Muhammad vide

order dated 05.07.2017 by the learned trial Court/ Sessions

Judge, Lakki Marwat, in case FIR No.394 dated 17.10.2016

under sections 324/34 PPC, Police Station Peezu, Lakki

Marwat.

2. Brief facts of the case as alleged by the

complainant in the crime report are that the respondent is one of
-2-

the nominated accused in the crime report with the allegation

for attempting to commit Qatle Aamd of the complainant by

firing effectively and his brother ineffectively.

3. Learned counsel for the complainant argued that

in the earlier round of litigation bail of the accused Faiz

Muhammad was declined vide order dated 15.12.2016 by this

Court on merits, however, learned trial court was directed to

accelerate the proceedings of the trial and conclude the same

within a period of five months, failing which petitioner should

be at liberty to approach the trial court for his release on bail.

Learned AA.G shall assure to submit challan within 15 days

and the delay if caused by the petitioner and his counsel shall

not be counted towards the said time limit. He next contented

that complete challan was submitted before the learned Judicial

Magistrate Lakki Marwat on 14.01.2017. The case was received

to the learned Sessions Judge from the court of the learned

Judicial Magistrate Lakki Marwat on 14.01.2017. Formal

charge was framed on 27.01.2017 and statement of five PWs

were recorded by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Lakki

Marwat till 10.06.2017, however the trial could not be
-3-

concluded within a period of five months as directed by the by

this Court, where after the accused filed an application for the

grant of post arrest bail on the ground that order of the

Honorable High Court dated 15.12.2016 was not complied

with. They lastly argued that the learned trial Court while

granting post arrest bail has exercised jurisdiction injudiciously

and prayed for cancellation of bail.

4. As against that learned counsel representing the

accused Faiz Muhammad argued that the learned trial court had

failed to conclude the trial within a period of five months as

directed by honorable High Court, therefore, accused was

rightly released on bail.

5. Learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of the State

supported the contention of learned counsel for the complainant

and argued that mere non-compliance of the order of honorable

High Court would not make the accused entitled for concession

of bail, particularly when bail of the accused had already been

refused on merits by this Court.

6. Arguments heard and record perused.
-4-

7. Perusal of the record reveals that first bail

application moved by the respondent Faiz Mohammad before

this Court in Cr. BA No.437-B/2016, which was dismissed on

05.07.2016. He was allowed bail by the learned trial Court vide

order dated 05.07.2017, merely on the ground that his trial

could not be concluded within a period of five months as

directed by this Court. Non-compliance of the directions issued

to the trial Court to conclude the trial expeditiously or within

some specified period could not be considered as a valid ground

for the grant of bail to an accused being alien to the provisions

of section 497 Cr.PC, particularly, when his bail petition has

already been dismissed on merits by this Court, unless some

fresh ground is shown by the accused/respondent for

consideration of his request for the grant of bail, which is

lacking in the present case. In this respect reference can well be

made in case titled “Nasir Ahmad Vs The State (2016 PSC

Cri. 6). wherein it was held that:

“Neither non-compliance of directions issued to
trial court to conclude trial expeditiously or
within some specified time could be considered
as valid ground for grant of bail to an accused,

nor filing of direct complaint would have any
-5-

bearing as regards earlier bail refusing orders,
which had attained finality, unless some fresh
ground could be shown.”

8. The impugned order of learnt trial Court dated

05.07.2017 does not fulfill condition incorporated in section

497 Cr.PC, the same being illegal, therefore, by accepting this

bail cancellation application, the bail granting order of the

accused/ respondent is recalled and the accused/respondent Faiz

Muhammad is directed to be taken into custody to be treated as

an under trial prisoner. The Additional Registrar of this court is

directed to send the certified copy of this order to the learned

Sessions Judge, Lakki Marwat for future guidance.
