JUDGMENT SHEET

Cr. A No. 140-A/2010.

Date of hearing 28.05.2020.
Petitioner/s (The State) by Sardar
Muhammad Asif, AAG.

Respondent/s (Zaheer Gul & others) by
Mr. Zulfigar Ahmed, Advocate.

AHMAD ALL, J. This criminal appeal under
section 417 (2-A) Cr.P.C is directed against
the judgment dated: 18.02.2010 passed by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
Abbottabad, whereby, learned Court while
invoking jurisdiction under section 265-K Cr.
P.C, acquitted the respondents from the
charges levelled against them.

2. Brief but relevant facts of the case are
that complainant Muhammad Nisar on
25.12.2007 at about 3:00 hours had parked his
vehicle (bearing registration No. B-5067)
outside Lady Garden Park and went into park
with his family. At about 5:00 hours, when he

returned, the said motorcar was not there,
which was stolen by someone, therefore, the
complainant submitted an application, which
was incorporated into FIR No. 1404 dated:
25.12.2007 u/s- 381-A/411 PPC read with
Article 14 of Hadood Ordinance and
investigation was started. In the meanwhile,
accused Naseeb Gul, Zaheer Gul and
Muhammad Shoaib were intercepted at
Muslim Abad Barrier, while they were
travelling in the above motorcar, hence, they
were booked into present case. After
completion of investigation, complete challan
was submitted against the accused but during
the course of trial, an application under
section 265-K Cr. P.C was submitted for
acquittal of accused/respondents. Learned trial
Court after hearing learned counsel for parties
and learned APP, through impugned order
acquitted the accused/respondents. As far as
the accused/Naseeb Gul is concerned, he did
not face trial and avoided his attendance
before the Court, thereafter, proceedings
under section 512 Cr.P.C were initiated
against him and through the impugned order
he was declared as proclaimed offender and

perpetual warrant of arrest issued against him.
3. It is one of the contention of learned
AAG that the accused/respondents are directly
involved in commission of offence as they
were arrested red handed while they were
transporting the stolen vehicle.

4. Meticulous sifting of record reveals that
the complainant on 25.12.2007 had lodged
report regarding theft of his vehicle from
Lady Garden Park, which was shown to be
recovered on 28.12.2007 by the local police of
Police Station Cantt, Abbottabad from
Muslim Abad barrier vide recovery memo Ex
PW-2/1. Accused Zaheer Gul, Shoaib and
Naseeb Gul were also shown arrested on the
same day, however, it is very important to
mention here that a local newspaper named as
Naway-e-Hazara, before two days of said
recovery and arrest of accused Naseeb Gul,
Zaheer Gul and Shoaib i.e on 26.12.2007 had
published a news on front page, wherein, it
has been clearly mentioned that the above
Naseeb Gul was arrested by the local police of
Police Station Kot Najibullah District,
Haripur and the above stolen vehicle was also
recovered from his possession on 26.12.2007

and then accused Naseeb Gul alongwith
stolen car were handed over to the local police
of Police Station, Cantt, Abbottabad. These
two versions regarding mode and manner of
arrest of accused and recovery of vehicle
make the case of the accused/respondents
highly doubtful. As, if the above news was
not correct, then the police concerned might
had denied the same or any other action might
had been taken against the said newspaper for
publishing false news and if the said news
was correctly published in the newspaper,
which is obviously correct, then recovery
memo dated: 28.12.2007 was fake as accused
Naseeb Gul was already arrested by District
Police of MHaripur on 26.12.2007 or
25.12.2007 and except recovery of stolen
vehicle there is nothing with prosecution to
connect the accused with commission of
offence.

5. PW-2 Khan Baz Khan is the important
witness of the case, as he is the witness of
recovery as well as of pointation of place of
occurrence. He in his examination-in-chief
stated that on 28.12.2007 accused Naseeb Gul
was driving the stolen vehicle, who was

arrested and vehicle was taken into possession
vide recovery memo Ex PW-2/1 dated:
28.12.2007. He in his cross-examination
admitted it correct that accused Naseeb Gul as
per head lines of local police dated:
26.12.2007 was arrested alongwith vehicle
No. B-5067/AD from Kot Najibullah, District
Haripur. He in his whole statement nowhere
mentioned that two other accused were also
arrested from place of recovery.

6. As far as pointation of place of
occurrence by the accused is concerned, same
cannot solely be relied upon, when real facts
of the case speak otherwise as in the instant
case, especially when the pointation was joint
and place of occurrence was already in the
knowledge of police.

7. It has been held, time and again by the
superior courts, that a slightest doubt occurs
in the prosecution case is sufficient to acquit
an accused. For extending the benefit of
doubt, it is not necessary that there should be
many circumstances creating doubts, single
circumstance, creating reasonable doubt in the
prudent mind about the guilt of accused,
makes him entitled to its benefit, not as a

matter of grace or concession, but as a matter
of right. Reliance could be placed on 2009
SCMR 230, 2011 SCMR 664, 2011 SCMR
646, 1984 PLD SC 433, 2012 MLD 1358,
2007 SCMR 1825, 2008 P.Cr.L.J 376, 1994

PLD Peshawar 114, 2012 PLD Peshawar

2011 SCMR 820 & 2006 P.Cr.L.J SC 1002.
8. Perusal of entire record in the light of
arguments has led this Court to believe that
the learned trial court has __ properly
appreciated the entire record available on file
in its true perspective and rightly returned
verdict of acquittal of accused/respondents, as
from the very beginning, the prosecution has
left flaws in the case and failed to built-up the
case against the respondents.

9. In addition, before us is an appeal
against acquittal whereâ€™ standard for
appreciation of evidence is different than the
one in appeal against conviction, as once an
accused is acquitted, then he earns double
presumption of his innocence, which cannot
be taken away from him unless it is shown
that the judgment of acquittal is based on
surmises or presumptions, which is not the

case here.
10. Thus, this Court reached to the
conclusion that the learned trial Court has
rightly acquitted the respondents by accepting
their application under section 265-K Cr. P.C
by scrutinizing all the record and keeping in
view the facts of the case, warranting no
interference by this Court, therefore, the
instant appeal is dismissed.

Announced.
