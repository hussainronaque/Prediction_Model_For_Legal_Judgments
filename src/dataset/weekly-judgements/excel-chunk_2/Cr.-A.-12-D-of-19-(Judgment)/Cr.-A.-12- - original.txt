2. Facts of the case as spelt out from the FIR, in
brief, are that on 09.9.2015 at 0030 hours, complainant
Badshah Khan, in injured condition, made report to the
local police in Emergency Room of Mufti Mehmood
Hospital, D.I-Khan, to the effect that at Isha Wela,
accused Qaizar Khan had attempted to commit unnatural
act with his son Ehsanullah and on 08.9.2015, he was
going to the house of accused for complaint, at 09:00
p.m, when he reached near the house of one Rab Nawaz
Marerra, the accused duly armed with 30 bore pistol was
standing there; on complaint, the accused started firing at
the complainant with the intention to commit his gatl-e-
amd, as a result of firing the complainant was hit on his
back. The accused decamped from the spot after the
occurrence. Besides the complainant, the occurrence was
stated to be witnessed by one Masood son of Gul
Rehman and other co-villagers. Motive for the offence is
stated above. He charged the accused for the commission
of offence. On this report murasila Ex. PW 3/1 was
drafted and sent to police station where FIR Ex. PA was
registered against the accused. On 10.9.2015, the injured
complainant succumbed to his injuries in Civil Hospital,
D.I Khan, therefore, section of law was changed from
324 to 302 PPC.

3. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted against the accused to the trial

Court, where at the commencement of the trial the
Ne

-3-

prosecution produced and examined as many as thirteen
witnesses. On close of the prosecution evidence, accused
was examined under section 342, Cr.P.C., wherein he
denied the allegations, professed innocence and stated to
have falsely been implicated in the present case,
however, neither he wished to produce defence, nor
opted to examine himself on oath as required under
section 340(2), Cr.P.C. The learned trial Court, on
conclusion of the trial, convicted the accused vide
impugned judgment dated 27.02.2019 and sentenced him
as mentioned above, hence this appeal.

4. We have considered submissions of the
learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the
record of the case with their valuable assistance.

5. It was on 08.9.2015, that Ehsan Ullah
(PW-11) narrated to his father, now deceased, that about
1:00 pm, while lying in his Baithak, the
appellant/accused entered and tried to unfasten his
shalwar to commit sodomy with him, who was strongly
resisted and eventually left unsatisfied. The deceased
took it to his heart and according to the report the
deceased went in search to register his complaint to the
appellant, who came across near the house of one
Rabnawaz Marrera, where on complaint, the accused
fired at the deceased with his 30 bore pistol which
resulted into the fatal injury. Two witnesses put their

appearance i.e. Masood, who was examined as PW-12
-4-

and Zahoor PW-13, Masood statedly is closed relative
and Zahoor real brother of the deceased. Masood PW put
himself at point No.3 of the site plan and to justify his
presence at the time and place, he stated that he was
searching for his missing goat. This witness stated that he
saw the accused and deceased standing and was about to
ask for his missing goat that the accused/appellant fired
at the deceased, who fell down, whereas the appellant
went to his house. He further stated that brother of the
deceased Zahoor (PW-13) with other people attracted to
the spot and the injured was shifted to his house for
onward management.

6. It is of immense importance to mention that
while perusing the record, our attention was brought to
Nagal Madd No.12 dated 09.9.2015, entered at 2:00 p.m,
when the appellant/convict was taken to Mufti Mehmood
Civil Hospital, D.I-Khan, in injured condition, the report
was entered by the Incharge Reporting Centre, where the
appellant charged the deceased alongwith PW Zahoor
and Masood for the injuries on his body at 9:00 p.m, on
08.9.2015, while armed with pistol and sticks
respectively, but that was not taken to a logical
conclusion and was abandoned. The time of report in
both the cases increases our curiosity to know that why
both the injured were received in the hospital with an

abnormal delay? and the report of the deceased then
-5-

injured at midnight in the hospital questions the presence
of the witnesses at the time of incident.

7. The prosecution witnesses are in happy
conflict with each other and with time they fell victim to
dishonest improvements. The defence thoroughly cross-
examined eyewitnesses. PW-12 was confronted with his
161, Cr.P.C. statement and the stance he took in his
Court statement was not taken earlier. The purpose of his
presence on the spot was later on introduced with other
material improvements. This witness was allegedly
standing at a distance of 12 paces, the dark had prevailed,
how could he recognize the two i.e. the deceased and the
appellant and how could he say with certainty that the
accused was armed with a 30 bore pistol. No attempt was
made to catch hold the accused despite the fact the
accused being of tender age. PW Zahoor is the real
brother of the deceased, who was examined as PW-13.
He stated that he was informed by Ehsan Ullah and he
left after the deceased, this witness further stated that
while proceeding towards the house of the appellant, he
came across the accused with pistol in his hand and at a
little distance, the deceased then injured was lying on the
ground. Both these witnesses stated that the injured was
shifted to his house, but we are surprised to see that none
of these witnesses accompanied the injured to the
hospital. It was one Sahib Jan, who accompanied the

deceased then injured to the hospital. We are curious to
-6-

know that despite the fact the injured was fighting a
battle of life and death, why he was not shifted to the
hospital there and then to save his life, where was he kept
for three and half long hours without providing first aid.
Sahib Jan was examined as PW-10 and he was the person
who stated to have taken the injured to the hospital. This
witness tried his utmost to cover the delay and he
tendered abnormal explanation, in this respect, which
could not convince us rather tarnished the character of
this witness. This witness was not shown present with
the deceased then injured in the hospital, neither the
police nor the doctor stated a word regarding his
presence, so much so the injury sheet, medico legal
report and even the report is totally silent regarding his
presence. Had he been present with the injured at the
time of report, surely he could have verified the report.
The delay in reporting the incident and non-presence of
witness with the injured in the hospital lead us nowhere
but to hold that the witnesses were chance and interested
witnesses. In case titled Khalid Javed_and another vs.
The State (2003 SCMR_1419), it was observed that
evidence of chance witness would be acceptable subject
to establishing his presence at the place of incident and in
the absence of corroborative evidence to support the
version of a chance witness the same had to be excluded
from consideration. Reference can also be made to the

cases reported as Javed Ahmad alias Jaida vs. The State

-7-

1978 SCMR 114), Muhammad Ahmad & another ys.
The State & others (1997 SCMR 89), Imran Ashraf &
others vs, The State (2001 SCMR 424) and Zafar Hayat
vs. The State (1995 SCMR 896). In the case titled Allah
Ditta_vs. The State (1999 YLR 1478), the Hon’ble

Lahore High Court held that chance witnesses cannot be

safely relied upon on a capital charge in the absence of
satisfactory explanation regarding their presence near the
place of occurrence where they were ordinarily expected
to be present. In the case of Muhammad Akram vs. The
State (2008 P.Cr.L.J 993), it was observed that chance
witness cannot be believed safely if he fails to offer
cause of his presence at the spot at a given time.

8. We are convinced that the both the sides
totally suppressed the real facts from this Court as well
as from the trial Court, the convict was minor at the time
of incident and that there was no reason for him to fire
and kill the deceased. If the stance of the appellant which
was taken vide daily diary No.12 dated 09.9.2015 is
taken into consideration, it leads to a total uncertainty as
to what happened at the time which led to injuries and
later on death of the deceased. The witness did not come
with the whole truth and they could not established their
presence at the relevant time on the spot.

9. There was no previous motive between the
parties, but what was conveyed by PW-11 Ehsan Ullah to

his father i.e. the deceased, the story forwarded by the
-8-

deceased while injured that he had gone to the accused/
appellant to register a complaint with him for what he
had done to his son in the afternoon. This stance of the
deceased failed to convince us, had he gone after the
elders of the accused, then it was easily acceptable that
the purpose was no more but to convey his grievances
but here, his going after the accused tells nothing but to
fix him and this was what the daily diary No.12
suggested where the scribe also noted down that he also
prepared injury sheet of the appellant, though onward in
that respect the prosecution as well as the appellant
maintained silence. In case titled “Muhammad Akram
Vs. The State” 1988 P Cr.LJ 63 it was held that:-

“The prosecution has not come with

true facts of the case and they have

concealed the material facts from

disclosure. The prosecution version is

wholly different from the one they have

placed before the police than the one

they have relied upon before the trial

Court”.
10. The question is still lurking about in mind
that how the deceased received firearm injury, at what
time and in what manner; that how the witnesses
coincidently reached the spot; that why dishonest
improvements were made, the conduct of witnesses is
not above board and they all tried to conceal the real
facts and hesitated to travel with the truth, their this

conduct takes us nowhere, but to hold them interested

and inimical.
-9-

In case titled Akhtar Ali & others Vs. The

State (2008 SCMR-6), the Honourable Supreme Court of
Pakistan has ruled that when a witness improves his
version to strengthen the prosecution case, his improved
statement subsequently made cannot be relied upon as
the witness has improved his statement dishonestly,
therefore, his credibility becomes doubtful on the well-
known principle of criminal jurisprudence _ that
improvements once found deliberate and dishonest cast
serious doubt on the veracity of such witness. In case
titled Farman Ahmad Vs. Muhammad Inayat and

others (2007 SCMR_1825), the august Supreme Court

has laid down the dictum about validity of statement of a
witness improving his version subsequently to strengthen
the prosecution case. The same view has been re-
enforced by the apex Court in Muhammad Saleem's
case (2011 SCMR 474). Reference may be made to the
case law reported as Muhammad Rafique_ and others
Vs. The State and others (2010 SCMR 385), Irfan Ali
Vs. State (2015 SCMR 840), Ali Sher Vs. State (2015
SCMR 142), Javaid Akbar Vs. Muhammad Amjad and
Jameel alias Jeela (2016 SCMR_ 1241), Azeem Khan
Vs. Mujahid Khan (2016 SCMR 274), Sardar Bibi and
another Vs. Munir Ahmed and_others 2017 SCMR

344), Muhammad Mansha Vs. The State (2018 SCMR

272).

11. The Investigating Officer, who was examined
as PW-9 stated that on pointation of the witnesses, he
prepared the site plan but no blood was recovered where
the deceased then injured after receiving firearm injury
fell to the ground and was lying for some time and as
such, no crime empty was recovered. The Investigating
Officer did not take the pains to examine someone in the
surrounding regarding the occurrence, in fact there was a
joint venture to conceal the material facts with the sole
purpose to single out the accused. We found daily diary
No.12 on the record, but the Investigating Officer did not
investigate the case from that angle, despite the fact that
the appellant’s presence was admitted in the hospital, but
there is persistent silence that who brought him at such
odd hours i.e. 2:00 a.m, to the hospital being minor. The
malafide of the prosecution is evident from the
record that all the times, an attempt was made to accept
him major, for this purpose even no hesitation was
felt to tamper the discharge slip. The card of arrest
(Ex. PW 7/1) was prepared on 09.9.2015, wherein the
age of the appellant has been tampered and is written as
20/21 years, in the hospital discharge slip, the age was
shown 20 years, whereas in daily diary No.12, the age
was put as 17/18 years. The conduct of the prosecution
was seriously challenged in this respect and need was felt
for ossification and ultimately ossification was done on

22.10.2015, and according to final opinion, the age came
-ll-

out to be between 15-16 years, form for age computation
Radiology Department DHQ Hospital, D.I.Khan is
available on file. The tender age of the appellant at the
time of the incident belies the prosecution story and we
are not ready to believe the mode and manner in which
the occurrence is alleged to have taken place occurrence.
12. The prosecution has erected its structure on
the dying declaration, as the report was stated to be made
by the deceased then injured, in the hospital. The
prosecution was under heavy duty to have taken all
measures while recording the report, no certificate was
requested from the doctor concerned that the patient was
oriented in time and space, the murasila has not been
attested from the doctor and even the doctor in his
statement did not mention that the injured was capable to
talk and neither his pulse was recorded and so the blood
pressure. The prosecution failed to establish that the
report was made by the deceased then injured and that at
the time of report, he was free from all influences. The
question still remains a question that why the injured
witness was brought with an abnormal delay to the
hospital with no first aid and when left unattended, could
he retain his faculties to talk and understand, our
approach is no other but to hold “No” he could not.

No doubt, dying declaration is an important
piece of evidence and that sanctity is attached to the

dying declaration, because a dying man is not expected
-12-

to tell lie, but it is equally true that it is always
considered as weak type of evidence being un-tested by
cross-examination, therefore, it puts the Courts on guard
and great care is demanded to ascertain that:-

1. Whether the maker has the physical
capacity to make the dying declaration.

2. Whether the maker had opportunity to
identify the assailant/assailants.

3. Whether there was a chance of mis-
identification on the part of dying man in
identifying and naming the
attacker/attackers.

4. Whether it was free from prompting
from any outside quarter; and.

5. The witness who heard the deceased making
his statement, heard him correctly and
whether this evidence can be relied upon.

It is universal principle of criminal justice that
dying declaration by itself is not a strong evidence being
not tested by way of cross- examination. The only reason
for accepting the same is the belief phenomenon of the
court of law that a person apprehending death due to
injuries, caused to him, is ordinarily not expected to
speak a falsehood. To believe or disbelieve a dying
declaration thus is left to the ordinary human judgment,
however, the Courts always insist upon strong,
independent and reliable corroboratory evidence for the
sake of safe dispensation of justice. Relying blindly and

without proper scrutiny on such statement, would be no

less dangerous approach on the part of the Courts of law.
-13-

In case titled Mst Ghulam_Zohra and

another Vs. Malik Muhammad Sadiq and another
(1997 SCMR 449), it has been held that:-

“Police Officer had not obtained

certificate from the Doctor before

recording the statement of the deceased

in an injured condition that he was in a

fit condition to give the statement, nor

he had given a plausible explanation for

such omission and fitness of the

deceased to make the statement, thus,

remained doubtful”.
13. The appellant was arrested from the hospital
and on the next day the Investigating Officer shown
recovered a 30 bore pistol on his pointation from a cow
dung hill, but this recovery failed to establish on two
grounds (1) that no independent witness was associated
at the time of recovery of the pistol and section 103,
CrP.C. was not complied with (2) nothing has been
brought on record that the house where-from the
recovery was effected, was the house of the appellant.
Furthermore, no empty was recovered from the spot,
therefore, the pistol so recovered has lost its evidentiary
value, particularly in the murder case.

Even otherwise, recovery if proved, is of no
help to the prosecution keeping in view peculiar facts
and circumstances of the present case, therefore, no
conviction could be passed on the basis of such type of
recovery and that too on a capital charge.

14. After scrutinizing the evidence available on

record, we are of the considered view that the ocular
SS.

an

-14-

evidence is insufficient to convict the appellant. We also
find that the investigation has not been conducted
honestly, false improvements have been made in order to
involve the accused and with the particular object the
evidence was manipulated so as to strengthen the
prosecution case. Therefore, we are not convinced with
the evidence of recovery of weapon from the possession
of the appellant.
15. In the light of what has been discussed above,
the prosecution case is highly doubtful and has not been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, the appellant
is entitled to the benefit of doubt, which was accordingly
given to him, while passing the short order of even date
that reads as under:-
“For reasons to be recorded late in the
detailed judgment, we allow this appeal, set
aside the impugned conviction and sentence
awarded to the appellant Qaizar Khan, vide
judgment dated 27.02.2019, passed by
learned Additional Sessions Judge-VI,
D.LKhan. Resultantly, appellant is acquitted
of the charge levelled against him in the said
case. He be released forthwith, if not

required to be detained in any other case”.
