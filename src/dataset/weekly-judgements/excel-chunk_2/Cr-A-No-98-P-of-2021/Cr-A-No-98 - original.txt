DR. KHURSHID IQBAL, J.-This appeal is directed against

the Judgment, dated, 01.10.2020 passed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IIJ/ Model Criminal Court
Nowshera, by which he acquitted the respondent/accused
Muhammad Shafiq in case FIR No. 800, registered on
30.12.2017, under section 9-C, of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, at Police Station

Akora Khattak.

02. Facts germane to the instant appeal shortly are that
on 30.12.2017, while a police party led by one Khan Zeb, ASI,
was at patrolling duty in the locality, it got spy information that
a man was standing across the G.T Road near Mian Abad Pattak
Akora Khattak. The spy information was that the man was in
possession of chars. Considering the information as genuine, the

police party rushed to the aforesaid place and as per, the

¥

identification of the informer, the man was overpowered. In the
right hand of the man, a plastic wrap was found. When the
wrapper was checked, 03 sub-wraps, containing chars, were
found. After weighing, packets 1,2 and 3 were found to be
1055, 1010 and 955 grams respectively; the total of which came
out to be 3020 grams. The seizing officer separated 05 grams
from each packet which were sealed in three different parcels.
The remaining was sealed in another parcel. On interrogation,
the man (now the respondent) disclosed that he was Muhammad
Shafiq son of Ziarat Gul, resident of Malak Din Khel, formerly
Khyber Agency. The seizing officer drafted the murasila, issued
card of arrest of the respondent, drafted an application for
chemical analysis of contraband chars and prepared the memo
of recovery. As the murasila was sent to the PS Akora Khattak,

the case was registered against the respondent.

03. Afier completion of the investigation, the final
report (Challan) was put before the learned trial Judge. After
fulfilling of the necessary formalities per the procedure, charge
was framed against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty

and professed innocence.

04. In support of its case, the prosecution examined as

many as 06 witnesses.

05. It seems pertinent to provide synopsis of the

prosecution evidence for ready reference, in the table below:-

06. At the close of the prosecution evidence, the

respondent was examined Under Section 342 Cr.PC. The

respondent was provided an opportunity to record statement on

oath and/or produce evidence in his defense. He did not prefer

to avail such opportunity.

07. After hearing the arguments, the learned trial Judge

acquitted the respondent by his Judgment impugned herein.

08. While the appellant has set up as many as 10

grounds of appeal, the key ground is that the respondent was
arrested red-handed having the contraband chars in his

possession, the report of FSL is in positive and that Section 21

of the CNSA 1997 was wrongly applied.

9. We have heard the arguments of Mr. Niaz
Muhammad, learned AAG for the appellant (the State) and Mr.

Abid ullah Advocate, learned counsel for the respondent.

10. The learned AAG argued for the appellant that a
huge quantity of contraband chars were recovered from the
personal possession of the respondent. He further argued that
the FSL report corroborates the prosecution version inasmuch
as the narcotics substances were positively found to be chars.
He stated that section 21 of CNSA could not be applied in the

light of the case law developed by the higher courts.

11. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the
respondent argued that the prosecution has badly failed to bring
home the charge against the respondent. He pinpointed the
number of dents and defects in the prosecution evidence. To
mention, but a few here, firstly, the seizing officer sent to the PS
the murasila only; the respondent was at such a good distance
from the police party that he could run away from the spot but
he did not do so. The PW furnished contradictory evidence

regarding the shape of contraband chars and that they did not

place on record, copy of the Daily Diary (DD) of departure

from and arrival in the PS.

12. The sole point for determination is that whether
learned trial judge has properly evaluated the evidence on the

record by acquitting the respondent or not.

13. We would like to start with the recovery
proceedings conducted by the police officials. In the recovery
memo while the contraband chars were shown as “Pukhta”, its
shape such as slabs or otherwise was not mentioned. One Said
Rasan LHC No. 1231 (PW-6) a marginal witness of the
recovery memo while, under cross examination, deposed that
the packets were in the shape of slabs and not in the shape of
pieces. He could not recollect the total number of slabs inside
each packet. The arresting officer (PW-3) in response to a
question during cross examination, replied that he is unable to
remember the number of slabs in each packet. He even failed to
state whether wrapper (Shopping Bag) was sealed in parcel No.
4 or not. This is quite astonishing for the reason that the same
PW has mentioned in murasila and the recovery memo that he
has sealed the packets. Thus, he being the star witness of the
prosecution, materially contradicts both the murasila and the
recovery memo. This doubt sinks further deeper when the case

property was opened before the trial Judge who made the

following observation:

6

On de-sealing the parcel No. 4, seal monogram was
found inside the parcel. 3 packets were found inside the
parcel in a shopping bag and each wrapped in yellow
solution tape. Corner of all the three packets were cut.
One packet contained 4 sub slabs while 2 packets
contained 2 sub slabs. Each packet had small piece of
contraband wrapped in solution tape. One small piece of
contraband also contained inside the parcel besides the 3

packets.

Thus, there is a serious doubt about the shape of contraband

chars.

14. The seizing officer mentioned in the murasila and
in his statement recorded under cross examination that he
handed over only the murasila to one constable Yaseen. PW-6
contradicted this version saying that the respondent along with
the case property and the murasila were sent to the PS through
constable Yaseen”. If only the murasila was sent to the PS, then
ae the case property and the respondent should have been available
on the spot the time the I.O (PW-4) arrived there, but the 1.0
stated that when he reached the spot, the case property was
already sent to the PS. It follows that the 1.0 did not took into
his possession the case property on the spot. Rather, as he has
testified, he handed over the case property to the Muharrir on
01.02.2018. the FSL report reflects that it was received in the
laboratory on 03.01.2018. Even if the aforementioned date
01.02.2018 is considered as a clerical mistake, stil] it is not clear

as to when exactly the I.O received and then handed over the

case property to the Muharrir of the PS. Another material doubt
in this context is that the Muharir (PW-S) stated that he received

all the four parcels from Khan Zeb seizing officer.

15. It is evident from the testimony of Nabiullah HC
(PW-2), who took the samples to the FSL, that he received the
parcels containing the samples, from Naeem Ullah MHC
(PW-S5) on 02.01.2018, the third day of the occurrence. The
aforesaid Naeem Ullah (PW-S) has also stated the same facts,
admitting that the occurrence took place on 30.12.2017. The
prosecution offered no explanation at all as to why the case

property was not immediately sent to the FSL.

16. The PWs have admitted that the place of
occurrence is visible from a long distance which means that the
respondent could manage to run away from the spot, but the
latter did not do so. The seizing officer (PW-3) clearly admitted
this fact that the contraband chars was seized by the
complainant who also sealed it in parcels. There is nothing on
the record that the IO (PW-4) himself examined the case
property. In other words, the 1.0 appears to have taken it for
granted that whatever was sealed, was nothing but chars, as the
seizing officer mentioned in the papers. It follows that the IO
did not discharge his duty of independently sorting out that the
case property was in fact the chars and that it was exactly of the
same kind and weight as the seizing officer mentioned it in the

murasila and the recovery memo. Indeed, as the record very

much clearly demonstrates, most of the investigation was
already conducted by the seizing officer, having prepared the
recover memo, drafted the application for the purpose of
chemical analysis at the FSL. Key proceedings conducted by
the IO were recording of statements of the PWs Under Section
161 Cr.PC, preparing the site plan and obtaining report of the
FSL. The main activities ranging from the registration of the
case to key elements of investigation, such as, the drafting of
the recovery memo, the separation of the sample, its sealing as
well as the sealing of the remaining in parcels and arresting of
the accused, all were done by PW3— an official of the
preventive branch of the police. This has become rather a
routine in the narcotics cases and have grabbed the attention of
the higher courts in many a cases. For example, in the: case
reported as PLD 2018 826 [Peshawar], the hon’ble Court
bserved that such cases warrant “close and cautious scrutiny of
the evidence adduced by the prosecution.” Reference may also
made to 2016 YLR 1189 Peshawar and PLD 2005 Karachi 128.
in which it was held as under:
The complainant is highly interested in the case
as he had detected the offence and would like to
see that the accused should be convicted
therefore, he should not be made the Judge of his
own cause. As such his version should be
investigated by another officer, which will ensure

the fair investigation of the complaint of the
complainant.

17. As discussed above the prosecution has failed to

prove the custody of the contrabands chars and its transmission

to the FSL. The question of delay in sending the narcotics to the

FSL linked with the issue of safe custody has also been
considered by hon’ble the Supreme Court in many judgments.
In a 2018 case, the hon’ble Court ruled that the chain of custody
of the narcotic substance shall be ensured as it plays pivotal role

(2018 SCMR 2039). The relevant para is reproduced below:

The chain of custody begins with the recovery of
the seized drug by the Police and includes the
separation of the representative sample(s) of the
seized drug and their dispatch to the Narcotics
Testing Laboratory. This chain of custody, is
pivotal, as the entire construct of the Act and the
Rules rests on the Report of the Government
Analyst, which in turn rests on the process of
sampling and its safe and secure custody and
transmission to the laboratory. The prosecution
must establish that the chain of custody was
unbroken, unsuspicious, indubitable, safe and
secure. Any break in the chain of custody or lapse
in the control of possession of the sample, will cast
doubts on the safe custody and safe transmission of
the sample(s) and will impair and vitiate the
conclusiveness and reliability of the Report of the
Government Analyst, thus, rendering it incapable
of sustaining conviction. This Court has already
held in Amjad Ali v. State (2012 SCMR 577) and
Tkramullah v. State (2015 SCMR 1002) that where
safe custody or safe transmission of the alleged
drug is not established, the Report of the
Government Analyst becomes doubtful and
unreliable.

18. The FSL report shows that the Control of Narcotic
Substances (Government Analysis) Rules, 2001, were not
followed meaningfully. The Test Report that contains
fulfillment of several protocols for chemical test. Except for one
protocol called Duquenois Test, which was marked as “tive”,

the rest were just scored off. Similarly, the details about

instrumental analysis shows that just one protocol called
Thinlayer Chromatography (TLC), which was marked as +ive,
the remaining were left blank. On physical examination, the
narcotic substance was observed as brown solid. In a 2015 case
that was approvingly followed in the above cited case of 2018,
the hon’ble Court made detailed observations on the 2001 Rules

referred to above.

19. In the light of above discussion, we have reached
to the conclusion that the prosecution has badly failed to prove
the charge against the respondent. We are of the considered
view that the learned trial Judge has properly appreciated the
evidence on record and scored out the material anomalies in the
prosecution case. Being devoid of merits, this appeal is
dismissed.
