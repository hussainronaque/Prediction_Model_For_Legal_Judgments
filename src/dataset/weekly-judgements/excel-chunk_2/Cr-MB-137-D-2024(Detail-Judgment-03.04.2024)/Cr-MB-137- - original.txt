FAZAL SUBHAN, J.- Instant is a bail application
under Section 497, of the Criminal Procedure Code,
1898, (Code), wherein the petitioner Nadeem Durrani
son of Najib Ullah seeks post-arrest bail in case FIR
No.08/21 dated 09.7.2021, registered under sections 9(c)
of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, at
Police Station ANF, D.I.Khan.

2. Facts need not to be reiterated as bail
petition of the petitioner was dismissed by this Court on

merit vide order dated 04.10.2021, rendered in

Cr.MBA.No.394-D/2021.
3. Arguments heard and record perused.
4. After considering the arguments of

learned counsel for the parties, the available record

reveals that in the present case, the petitioner was

De

arrested on 09.7.2021, complete challan was submitted
before the trial Court on 29.10.2021, while charge was
framed on 27.11.2021, however, his trial could not be
concluded as yet. The petitioner is in the judicial
lockup for more than two years and for considering the
bail plea on the ground of statutory delay in
conclusion of trial, is to be reckoned from the date of
arrest of the petitioner. Needless to say that on few
occasion, dates were adjourned due to strike of
lawyers, absence of Presiding officers, engagement of
official witnesses in emergency duties or due to any
natural calamities like Covid-19 virus and floods,
however, during all this period the petitioner remained
in custody as under-trial prisoner and adjournment of
case due to the above reasons were beyond his control,
hence delay in progress of case owing to these reasons
cannot be attributed to the petitioner. Even
adjournment of case due to absence of a co-accused,
already on bail, cannot be counted against an accused
who is regularly produced before the trial Court from
prison. Since the trial could not be concluded within
stipulated period of two years, as enumerated in
Section 497(1) third proviso (b), Cr.P.C., therefore,
petitioner is found entitled for grant of bail. In this

respect, reliance can be placed on case of “Shakeel

Shah Vs. The State and others” (2022 SCMR 1), and

iF

recently endorsed by the apex Court in judgment

reported as “Syeda Ayesha Subhani Vs. The State and

others” (PLD 2023 Supreme Court _648), wherein
principle has been laid down for extending benefit of
bail on statutory ground as following:

The purpose and objective of the 3rd
proviso, as observed by this Court in
Shakeel Shah, is to ensure that the trial
of an accused is conducted
expeditiously and that the pre-
conviction detention of a _ person
accused of an offence not punishable
with death does not extend beyond the
period of one year. If the trial in such
an offence is not concluded within a
period of one year for no fault of the
accused, the statutory right to be
released on bail ripens in his favour
unless his case falls within any of the
clauses of the 4th proviso. This right of
the accused creates a corresponding
duty upon the prosecution to conclude
the trial within the specified period of
one year. If any act or omission of the
accused hinders the conclusion of the
irial within a period of one year, no
such right will accrue to him and he
would not be entitled to be released on
bail on the statutory ground of delay in
conclusion of the trial. But if after the
rejection of his plea for bail on this
eround, the accused corrects himself
and abstains from doing any such act or
omission in the year following such
rejection but the prosecution fails to
perform its duty in concluding the trial
within the specified period of one year,
a fresh right, that is to say, a fresh
ground, would accrue in his favour”.

5. For the aforesaid reasons, the instant
petition is allowed and the accused/petitioner is directed

to be released on bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in

the sum of Rs:300,000/- (three lac) with two sureties,

-4-

each in the like amount, to the satisfaction of learned
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate.
6. Above are the reasons of my short order of

even date.
