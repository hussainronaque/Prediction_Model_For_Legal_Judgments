rer
SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.--- Appellant, Naseer Ahmad,
was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Takht
Bhai, District Mardan for the offence under section 302 PPC in
case FIR No.113 dated 09.07.2015 registered with Police
Station Saro Shah, District Mardan and vide judgment dated
05.05.2018, the appellant was convicted under section 302(b)
PPC and sentenced him to life imprisonment as Tazir alongwith
payment of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lac) as compensation
under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of deceased or in
default thereof, to undergo six months S.I. Benefit under
section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to the appellant. Being
aggrieved, the appellant through the instant criminal appeal has
assailed the above said judgment.

2. Brief facts of the case, as. unfolded in the first
information report, are that the complainant Rahmat Ali on
09.07.2015 at 14:30 hours, brought his brother namely Afsar
Ali in injured condition to Mardan Medical Complex, where he
lodged a report to the effect that injured Afsar Ali alongwith his
brother namely Niaz Ali went to the house of their cousin
namely Naseer Ahmad for the recovery of their amount; that in
the house of Naseer Ahmad, an oral altercation took place, as a
result of which, Naseer Ahmad made firing at Afsar Ali through
his pistol, due to which, he got hit and injured. The occurrence
is stated to have been witnessed by Niaz Ali. The motive is
alleged to be a money dispute between Afsar Ali and Naseer
Ahmad. The report of the complainant was penned down in the
shape of Murasila, which was sent to the PS for registration of
the case. Initially, the FIR ExPA was registered under section
324 PPC, however, when the injurec. Afsar Ali subsequently
succumbed to his injuries, then the section of law was altered
from one under section 324 PPC to 302 PPC.

3. After completion of investigation and arrest of the
accused / appellant, prosecution submitted complete challan,
where at the commencement of trial, the prosecution produced
and examined as many as 11 witnesses. On close of prosecution
evidence, statement of appellant / accused was recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein he professed innocence and false

implication, however, neither he opted to be examined on oath
as provided under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor wished to produce
defence evidence. After hearing arguments, the learned trial
Court vide the impugned judgment dated 05.05.2018, convicted
and sentenced the accused / appellant as mentioned above.
Hence, the instant appeal against the judgment of conviction.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the parties alongwith
learned A.A.G representing the State at length and scanned
through the record, with their valuable assistance.

5. In the unfortunate incident, the deceased, soon after
receiving the firearm injuries, was shifted to Mardan Medical
Complex and therefrom, to Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar
and while enroute to the hospital, he succumbed to his
injuries. The matter was reported by the complainant to the
local police, where the accused / appellant was charged for
the murder of the deceased. The report was drafted in the
shape of Murasila and thereafter, the injury sheet of the
deceased then injured was prepared and was shifted to the
doctor for medical examination. After examining the
deceased then injured, the doctor prepared the medico legal
certificate and referred the deceased then injured for
specialized treatment, but he could not survive and as such,
his dead body was brought back to the hospital, where the
local police prepared his inquest report and the dead body

was shifted to the doctor for postmortem examination. It is
pertinent to mention that the accused / appellant also received
injuries on his body, who was taken io the hospital in injured
condition, where he also reported the matter to the local
police vide daily diary No.35 of the even date, where he
charged Gul Rahman and Niaz Ali for the injuries caused to
him. After the FIR was registered against the accused /
appellant, a raid was conducted by: the local police at his
house, where the weapon of offence i.e .30 bore pistol was
taken into possession from his residential room and, as such,
he was also booked under section 15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 and was arrested as well. The
investigating officer after receiving hopy of the FIR, visited
the spot and on pointation of the eye witness, prepared the
site plan. During spot inspection, the investigating officer
collected two empties of .30 bore from the place of incident
and the same were sent to the firearms expert alongwith the
recovered pistol for asking an opiaion as to whether the
empties were fired from the recovered pistol. The laboratory
report was received in positive. The accused / appellant faced
trial and ultimately, was convicted vide the impugned
judgment.

6. There is no denial to the fact that the incident occurred
in the house of the accused, where on one hand, the deceased

lost his life, whereas, he himself received injuries on his
body, but this Court is to ascertain as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time; as to
whether the eye witness was present at the time of incident
and as to whether the accused / appellant received injuries at
the hands of his sister namely Mst. Dilfasan or at the hands of
Gul Rahman and PW Niaz Ali. In order to appreciate this
particular aspect of the case, we, on one hand, went through
the judgment of the learned trial Court, whereas, on the other,
the record of the case was scanned through. As on one hand,
the relationship between the parties is too close, whereas, on
the other, both the sides i.e. the deceased received firearm
injuries which led to his death and the accused / appellant
received blunt trauma, so this Court is to see as to who is
responsible to what extent.

7. The complainant was examined as PW-07, who stated
that on the day of incident, he was present in his grocery shop
situated at Shakh No.6, when he received information
regarding the incident; that when he; reached to the place of
incident, there he found the deceased then injured lying on a
cot in the thoroughfare, with people of the locality present
around; that the deceased then injured was shifted to the
hospital in a motorcar and the matter was reported. This is
admitted on record that the complainant is not the eye witness

of the incident, rather it was on information he received from
oats

PW Niaz Ali, that he rushed to the spot. This is astonishing to
note that when this witness was cross examined, he did not
mention the presence of Niaz Ali on the spot and even, he
denied his presence in the hospital at the time of report. In
order to appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we deem
it essential to go through the statement of PW Niaz Ali, who
was examined as PW-08. When the eye witness appeared
before the trial Court, he stated that on the day of incident, he
alongwith the deceased went to the house of the accused to
recover an amount of Rs.31,000/- from the accused; that
when they reached to the house, the accused was not present
in the house and it was after some time, that he came to the
house; that on demand, the amount was paid, but an
altercation took place between the accused and the deceased;
that the accused got infuriated and fited at the deceased with
his .30 bore pistol; that after the occurrence, he informed the
complainant, who rushed to the spot and took the deceased
then injured to the hospital. This witness remained silent that
through which source he informed the complainant regarding
the incident and that it was he who narrated the events to the
complainant. The statement of the complainant as well as that
of the eye witness, when read in juxtaposition, no ambiguity
is left that the eye witness never explained the incident to the

complainant and admittedly, he did not accompany the
complainant to the hospital. This is for the complainant to tell
that wherefrom he gathered the details of the incident, when
admittedly, the eye witness did not narrate the incident in the
manner it occurred. This is for the complainant to tell that
why he did not ask the eye witness to accompany him to the
hospital and this is for the eye witness to tell that when his
real brother was lying critically injured, what precluded him
to rush the deceased then injured to the hospital instead of
waiting for arrival of the complainant. Though, the eye
witness, in his cross examination, improved his statement by
stating that when the deceased then injured was put in the
motorcar, he himself hired another one and reached to the
hospital. On one hand, the complainant does not support his
statement in this respect, whereas, on the other, his presence
in the hospital has totally been deniéd by the complainant as
well as the scribe. If, for a while, we accept that the eye
witness was present in the hospital, when the matter was
reported, then instead of the complainant, he would have
reported the matter, as it was he who witnessed the incident
and not the complainant. The police officials, who were
present in the hospital, at the time of arrival of the deceased
then injured, denied the presence of the complainant in the
hospital. Neither PW Niaz Ali verified the report of the

complainant nor he came forward to report the matter. When
this is the state of affairs, we lurk no doubt in mind that the

complainant was not present in the, hospital at the time of
report and even at the time when the deceased then injured
was medically examined. The eye witness was cross
examined on different aspects of the case, more particularly,
regarding the shop he owns and his presence at the time of
incident. The witness confirmed that he owns a shop near his
house and that on the day of incident, he had also visited his
shop. From the attending circumstances of the present case,
we can draw an inference that either the deceased visited the
house of the accused alone or that soon after the incident, PW
Niaz Ali decamped from the spot.

8. Another astonishing aspect | of the case is the
introduction of PW Dilfasan, as while preparing the site plan,
her presence was not shown to the investigating officer and
even the site plan is silent regarding the availability of her
children at the time of incident. This is again astonishing that
when PW Dilfasan appeared before the trial Court, she stated
that on the day of incident, the deceased and PW Niaz Ali
visited her house; that at the time of incident, her three sons
and a daughter were present in the house, while she was busy
in the kitchen; that in the meanwhile, the deceased i.e. her
husband came to the house and the accused / appellant

demanded the outstanding amount; that though, the amount

Sy Sie agen AS
was paid by the deceased, but an altercation took place and
the deceased warned them not to visit his house in future; that
soon thereafter, the accused fired at the deceased, who fell
down and she took a wooden plank and struck the accused on
his head; that after the accused received injury on his head,
he fell unconscious. This part of the statement of PW
Dilfasan has twisted the prosecution story and as such, this
Court is to see as to whether it: was the report of the
complainant or it was the report of the accused, which is
nearer to the truth. As PW Niaz Ali is not the complainant of
the matter and as he, in his cross examination, also supported
the stance of PW Dilfasan and as the presence of the eye
witness is not established from record, so in that eventuality,
we are left with no option, but to touch the report made by
the accused, which was penned down in the shape of daily
diary No.35.

9. Though, the presence of the eye witness does not
appeal to a prudent mind, as he ‘displayed an unnatural
conduct. Had the eye witness been present and had the
deceased been fired at by the accused, then in the first
available opportunity, he would try to catch hold of the
accused and on the second, he would have rushed the
deceased, who was lying in critical condition, to the hospital

and would have reported the matter. Neither the eye witness
-10-

identified the dead body at the time when the report was
made nor at the time when inquest report was prepared and
the postmortem was conducted.

10. Whether the dispute between the parties was the
outstanding amount or the cause of killing is unknown? In
order to appreciate this particular aspect of the case, we
would like to revisit the statement of;the eye witness and that
of PW Dilfasan. The eye witness remained consistent that it
was an amount of Rs.31,000/-, which was to be paid by the
accused to the deceased, as the deceased had fixed a UPS for
the house of the accused, but PW Dilfasan explained the
motive in a different manner. She stated that an amount of
Rs.31,000/- was outstanding against the accused, as the
deceased had fixed the UPS for her house and that an amount
of Rs.55,000/- was outstanding against the accused, as her
husband had purchased a motorcycle from the deceased and it
was the accused to pay the outstanding amount. Neither the
investigating officer nor the scribe, at the time of drafting the
murasila, could recover the same amount from possession of
the deceased and even the witnesses did not produce the
amount so paid. When on one hand, the witnesses admitted
that the amount was paid to the deceased then on the other, it
was a must that either the same would have been produced or

would have been collected, but the record is silent in that
-ll-

}

respect. When so, we lurk no doubt in mind that the cause of
killing is shrouded in mystery.

11. True that the incident occurred inside the house of the
accused and equally true that the deceased then injured was
shifted from the house to the hospital, but the witnesses did
not come forward with the whole truth, We cannot forget the
conflict between the witnesses and their veracity regarding
the occurrence, but it alone should not be the sole
determining factor, as such, the benefit of the same cannot
outrightly be extended to the accused:/ appellant.

12. As this case is with unique characteristics, so we are to
appreciate both the aspects of the case i.e. the veracity of the
witnesses and the physical circumstances of the case. If this
Court reaches to a conclusion that the witnesses are not
telling the whole truth, then this Court is to assess the
physical circumstances of the preserit case, that too, in light
of the report made by the accused / appellant in the shape of
daily diary No.35. Keeping in view the close relationship
between the parties i.e. sister of the deceased was married to
the accused, so in that eventuality, substitution is a rare
phenomenon and the presence of the deceased in the house of
his sister at the relevant time is not unnatural. As the accused
/ appellant while reporting the matter to the local police,

admitted the outstanding amount and he disclosed that his
-12-

father in law i.e. Gul Rahman and the eye witness had beaten
him with fist and brick. Though, Mst. Dilfasan i.e. wife of the
accused claimed the beating of her husband with a wooden
plank, yet her husband i.e. the accused / appellant attributed
the same to one Gul Rahman and the eye witness, so at this
juncture, it is either the accused whose report is to prevail or
it is PW Mst. Dilfasan whose statement is to be appreciated.
When such is the state of affairs, this Court lurks no doubt in
mind that the occurrence is shrouded in mystery and that both
the sides came forward with the twisted facts. On one hand,
the incident occurred inside the house of the accused,
whereas, on the other, the laboratory report was received in
positive, so we are confident in holding that it was the
accused / appellant, who killed the deceased, but we are still
struggling that what led to his death and this indecisiveness
on part of the Court is a factor, which cannot be left
untouched. |

13. The moot question for determination is, as to what
would have been the appropriate sentence in the attending
circumstances of the case. The impugned judgment was
scanned through, where the learned trial Court too failed to
appreciate this particular aspect of the case. When the

witnesses could not succeed in proving on record that the

incident occurred in the manner as disclosed, then this Court

-13-

is left with the sole choice to collect from the record the real
circumstances, which led to the death of the deceased. There
is no dispute regarding the outstanding amount and both the
parties admitted the same in unequivocal terms, but both the
parties made willful attempts to either twist the story to his
favour or to conceal the real facts. In order to reach to a just
conclusion, we must revisit the report made by the accused /
convict appellant in the shape of daily diary, the statement of
Mst. Dilfasan and that of the eye witness. This is admitted on
record that when the deceased alongwith the eye witness
reached to the spot house, the atmosphere was calm and when
the deceased entered the house, no commotion was noticed. It
is further evident from the record that both the sides had no
intention to aggravate the situation to that extent, as on one
hand, the accused / appellant had got a UPS prepared /
repaired and on the other, a complaint was raised that the
same was not in working condition, When the amount was
paid, there was hardly an occasion for the accused / appellant
to kill the deceased, but the unfortunate parties entered in hot
altercation, which aggravated the situation to an extent that
on one hand, the unfortunate deceased lost his life, whereas,
on the other, the accused / appellant received multiple
injuries on his body. When an atmosphere of uncertainty

prevails, when the witnesses came forward with twisted facts
-14-

and when the parties involved in active concealment of the
actual happenings, then this Court is left with the only option
to take into consideration the quantum of sentence awarded.
After appreciating the available record and the statements of
the witnesses, this Court reaches to an inescapable conclusion
that the learned trial Court has failed to appreciate the
collected evidence and recorded statements and as such,
while handing down the impugned judgment, misdirected
itself both in law and on facts, which warrants interference.
Wisdom could also be derived from the judgment of the Apex
Court in Jail Petition No.355 of 2018 “Muhammad Abbas &
Muhammad Ramzan Versus The State” wherein it was held

that:
“However, so far as -the quantum of
punishment is concerned, we are of the
view that the occurrence took place at the
spur of the moment and there was no pre-
meditation on the part of the petitioners.
Admittedly, the occurrence took place in
the house of the petitioners where the
complainant party had brought a jirga for
return of Mst. Shakeela, niece of the
complainant, who was married with

petitioner Muhammad Mawaz against the
-15-

will of her parents. A bare perusal of the
record reveals that something happened
immediately before the occurrence, which
provoked the petitioners and they caused
churri blows on the person of the deceased.
On our specific query, learned Law Officer
and learned counsel for the complainant
could not deny the fact that the occurrence
took place at the spur of the moment.
Admittedly, both the petitioners did not
repeat their act. There was no deep rooted
enmity between the parties, In these
circumstances, the learned High Court
ought to have taken a lenient view.
Consequently, we convict the petitioners
under Section 302(c) PPC and sentence
them to fourteen years RI each. The
amount of fine and the sentence in default

whereof shall remain intact.”

14. Similarly, the situation has further been clarified by the
Apex Court in the case of "Raza and another v. The State

and others" (2020 SCMR 1185 wherein it is held that:
-16-

"10. As observed earlier, that the
occurrence had taken piace due to the act
of the deceased, which enraged the
mental faculty of the petitioner and under
the impulses of the same the instant
occurrence had taken place, the same is
spelled out from the record and as such
the benefit of the same is available for
which so many circumstances are not
required rather the glimpse of the same is
always deemed sufficient, which has been
established by the Supgrior Court from
time to time. ,

11, For what has been discussed above,
we are of the considered view that
sentence inflicted upon the petitioner by
learned Courts below under section
302(b), P.P.C. is not made out, therefore,
keeping in view the facts narrated above,
instant petition is converted into appeal
and same is partially allowed and we
convert the sentence from imprisonment

for life under section 302(b), P.P.C. to
-17-

imprisonment for 10 years under section

302(c), P.P.C.”
15. We, therefore, partially allow this appeal by setting aside
the conviction and sentence awarded tnder section 302(b) PPC
and instead, convict the appellant under section 302(c) PPC to
10 years rigorous imprisonment. The compensation of
Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lac) as imposed upon the
appellant under section 544-A Cr.P.C by the trial Court shall

remain intact. Benefit under section 782-B Cr.P.C is extended

to the appellant.
