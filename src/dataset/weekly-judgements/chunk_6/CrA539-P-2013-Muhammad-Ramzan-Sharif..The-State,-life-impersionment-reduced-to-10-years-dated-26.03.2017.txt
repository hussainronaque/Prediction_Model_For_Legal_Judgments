QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This single

both the Criminal Appeal and the Criminal
Revision pertain to the same case vide FIR

No.114 dated 11.07.2012 under section 302
PPC, Police Station, Shakardara, District

Kohat.

2. The appellant, Muhammad Ramzan
Sharif, himself lodged report in his house to
the SHO who was on mobile patrol duty and
received information about murder of an
unknown person in the house. The appellant
reported to the SHO that he was employee of
a Survey Company in Shakardara and after
performing duty when he entered his house at
21:30 hours on 11.07.2012 he found an
unknown person with his wife Noshad Begum
in the room in objectionable compromising
condition, which made him to take out his
pistol and fire at that person with which he
was hit, sustaining serious injury, and died on
the spot. The SHO drafted murasila, bearing
signature of the appellant; and after recovery
of 30 bore pistol with fixed spare charger and
five live rounds of 30 bore, the appellant was
arrested. An identity card was also recovered

from the deceased showing his name as
Mansoor Ali son of Hussain Gul resident of
Dargai, District Malakand. On the basis of
murasila, case/FIR was registered, leading to

investigation in the case.

3. During investigation, the 1.0 inspected
the spot, and secured blood from the place
assigned in the site plan to the deceased, and
also an empty shell of 30 bore, emitting smell
of fresh discharge, from the place assigned to
the appellant/accused. The site plan was
prepared by the |.0 on the pointation of Mst.
Noshad Begum. The postmortem examination
of the deceased revealed one firearm entry
wound with corresponding exit wound. The
FSL furnished positive report about the blood
stained earth and blood stained sha/war and
banyan of the deceased. Likewise, report of
the firearms expert about the 30 bore pistol
with a spare magazine and five 30 bore live
cartridges and one 30 bore crime empty was
in the affirmative. The appellant/accused was

arrested from the spot on the date of
occurrence i.e. 11.07.2012, and on the
following day of the occurrence i.e.
12.07.2012, he recorded confessional
statement before the learned Judicial
Magistrate, Kohat, wherein he furnished
graphic details of the occurrence, while saying
that he killed Mansoor Ali because he could
not bear the situation which he witnessed. The
1.0 also recorded statements of the PWs,
including wife of the appellant/accused and
the eyewitness, Mst. Noshad Begum, and
father of the deceased, namely, Hussain Gul:
and after completion of investigation,
complete challan was submitted in the case
by the local police to the learned trial Court

against the appellant/accused for facing trial.

4. In the trial Court, the
appellant/accused was formally charged
under section 302 PPC as well as 13 Arms
Ordinance; but the appellant/accused pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial. During trial, as

many as thirteen prosecution witnesses (PWs)
were examined, including material PWs like
Shaukat Saleem SI PS Shakardara, Kohat
(PW-1), who drafted murasila (EX.PA/1) on
the report of the appellant and also conducted
initial investigation besides submitting
complete challan in the case; Doctor Javed
Iqbal (PW-3), conducted postmortem
examination of deceased Mansoor Ali and
submitted postmortem report (EX.PM);
Hussain Gul (PW-5), father of the deceased;
Noshad Begum (PW-8), wife of the
appellant/accused, and the eye witness;
Amanullah Khan (PW-9), the Judicial
Magistrate, Kohat, recorded confessional
statement of the appellant/accused; and
Inspector Sami Ullah Khan (PW-11), the
Investigation Officer; besides other formal
witnesses; where after the prosecution closed
its evidence; and_ statement of the
appellant/accused was_ recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C. He neither opted to be
examined on oath nor expressed the desire to

produce defence evidence. Thereafter, having
heard the Additional Public Prosecutor for the
State assisted by learned counsel for legal
heirs of the deceased and learned defence
counsel, the learned trial Court/Sessions
Judge, Kohat, rendered the impugned
judgment dated 02.10.2013, thereby
convicting the appellant under section 302 (b)
PPC and awarding him the sentence of
imprisonment for life, with the direction to pay
compensation of Rs:200000/- and in default
thereof to undergo further — simple
imprisonment for six months. The
compensation, if recovered, was to be paid to
the legal heirs of the deceased within the
meaning of section 544-A Cr.P.C. The
appellant/accused was also convicted under
section 13 Arms Ordinance and sentence to
two years RI and fine of Rs:5000/- and in
default of payment of fine to further one month
SI. The learned trial Court extended benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C to the appellant, and

directed that the sentences of imprisonment
shall run concurrently. Hence the instant
appeal.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
convict-appellant and learned AAG assisted
by learned counsel for the
complainant/respondent heard; and _ record

perused.

6. The promptly lodged FIR on the report
of the appellant, bearing his signature, therein
confessing the qatl-i-amd of deceased
Mansoor Ali by him, his arrest from the scene
of occurrence which happens to be his house
and recovery of the pistol from his possession,
which was emitting smell of fresh discharge,
recovery of one crime empty of 30 bore from
the spot and matching result of the firearms
expert, confirmation of scene of occurrence
situated inside room of the house of the
appellant through positive result of the FSL
regarding blood stained earth secured from
the spot and blood garments of the deceased,

PM report showing one firearm entry wound
on the deceased, and above all, confessional
statement of the appellant are _ too
overwhelming pieces of evidence to cast any
doubt about commission of the offence in the
mode and manner disclosed in the FIR by the
appellant himself and also affirmed by him in
his confessional statement on the following
day of the occurrence. The qatl-i-amd by the
appellant under section 302 PPC is therefore
proved on the record, notwithstanding denial
of allegations of prosecution by the appellant
and retraction of his confession in his
statement under Section 342 Cr.PC and
concessional statement of his wife and the
sole eyewitness, namely, Noshad Begum
(PW-8), who was declared as a _ hostile

witness on the request of prosecution.

7. Having said that, the question falling
for determination would be whether the
appellant was rightly convicted by the learned
trial Court under section 302 (b) PPC or

keeping in view facts and circumstances of
the case he was liable to conviction under
section 302 (c) PPC.

8. It is an admitted fact that qgatl-i-amd of
Mansoor Ali, hailing from Dargai, District
Malakand, was committed by the appellant in
his house situated miles away from the native
village of the deceased at Shakardara, Kohat,
inside a room in his house when the former
was found by the latter in
objectionable/compromising condition with his
wife. It is also a fact that a single shot was
fired at the deceased by the appellant, which
caused his death, while the appellant spared
the life of his wife, which would leave no doubt
that this was not a case of honour killing as
according to all renowned dictionaries, the
honour killing is defined as killing by a male of
female member of the family, considered to
have brought dishonour to the family. The
very act of sparing the life of his wife and
effectively firing at the deceased and causing
his qatl-i-amd, when seen in the light of both

the below reproduced statements of the
appellant, firstly, in the FIR; and, then, in his
confessional statement, would make it
abundantly clear that it was not a case of
honour killing to invoke the provision of
section 302 (b) PPC and award sentence of
life imprisonment to the appellant.

In the FIR, the appellant narrated the

occurrence as follows;

‘e a

In his confessional statement, recorded on the
following day of the occurrence, after
repeating his statement in the FIR, though, the
appellant added that he hit his wife with the
butt of his pistol and that she made hue and
cry and escaped to the adjoining house; he,

nevertheless, stated that “I killed Mansoor Ali
because | cannot bear the situation which |

witnessed”.

9. The above reproduced two statements
of the appellant would prove one thing for sure
that after seeing an unknown person with his
wife in a room of his house, the appellant was
enraged/angered to the extent that he lost
control and committed the qatl-i-amd, which
would fall in the category of grave and sudden
provocation, excluding the possibility of
premeditated murder, falling under section
302 (c) PPC. In a similar situation, where the
wife was spared and deceased was
strangulated to death by the accused in
objectionable/compromising condition with his
wife, the august apex Court held in the case
titled Ali Muhammad-appellant.. Vs..Ali
Muhammad and another-respondents (PLD
1996 Supreme Court 274) that the qatl-i-amd
of deceased was result of grave and sudden

provocation, making accused in the case
liable to conviction and punishment under

section 302 (c) PPC.

10. On the other hand, there is nothing on
the record, even in the statements of father of
the deceased (PW-5) and that of uncle of the
deceased (PW-6), to explain presence of the
young man of 21 years from a distant place
i.e. Dargai, District Malakand, at a faraway
place inside the house of the appellant,
situated in Shakardara, Kohat, at odd hours,
other than his illicit relations with the wife of
the appellant, thus causing enrage/anger to
the appellant when he saw the deceased in
objectionable/compromising condition with his
wife. His loss of control was but natural on

such sight inside the room of his house.

11. Consequently, while maintaining
conviction of the appellant, the punishment is
altered from life imprisonment under section
302 (b) PPC to rigorous imprisonment for ten
(10) years under section 302 (c) PPC, and

also  maintaining/upholding rest of the
impugned judgment/order with respect to
payment of compensation of Rs:200000/- and
in default thereof to further six months simple
imprisonment. Accordingly, the compensation,
if recovered, shall be paid to the legal heirs of
the deceased within the meaning of section
544-A Cr.P.C. Likewise, the conviction of the
appellant under section 13 Arms Ordinance is
maintained/upheld in view of evidence of
recovery of the unlicensed 30 bore pistol
alongwith fixed charger and five live rounds of
the same bore, together with the sentence of
imprisonment of two years R.I and fine of
Rs:5000/-and in default thereof to one month
S.l. Similarly, the benefit of section 382-B
Cr.P.C shall remain extended to the appellant,
with order/direction of both the sentences of
imprisonment to run_ concurrently. The
impugned judgment/order of the learned
Sessions Judge, Kohat, dated 02.10.2013 is
modified to the above extent; and the criminal
appeal is disposed of, accordingly, in the

above stated terms.
12. The Criminal Revision (Cr.R No.03-
P/2014) by the State for enhancement of the
punishment awarded to Muhammad Ramzan
Sharif by the learned trial Court vide the
impugned judgment/order stands dismissed
following reduction in the period of sentence
of imprisonment from life under section 302
(b) PPC to ten (10) years RI under section
302 (c) PPC.
