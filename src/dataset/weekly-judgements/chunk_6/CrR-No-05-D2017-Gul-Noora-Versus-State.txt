ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- Through the instant petition under

sections 439/435 read with section 561-A Cr.P.C, the
petitioner Mst. Gul Noorg has called in question the order
dated 23.01.2017 rendered by learned Additional Sessions

Judge-IV, D.I.Khan, whereby accused Muhammad Khan

alias Muhammad was declared as proclaimed offender and

perpetual warrant of arrest was issued against him.

2. The brief facts giving rise to the instant petition
are that on the report of petitioner, a case vide FIR No.385
dated 04.10.2014: was registered at police station Saddar,
D.l.Khan under sections 302/324/148/149 PPC against
accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Gulab Khan, Fazal
Rehman, Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad and Abdur
Rehman. Complete challan against the accused was

submitted before the learned trial Court. In the meanwhile,

|

legal heirs of deceased Rehmatullah and Zar Muhammad
entered into compromise ‘with the accused and submitted
relevant documents: before the learned trial Court. The

learned Additional Sessidns Judge-IV, D.I.Khan recorded

joint statement of Mst. Gul Noora (widow) and injured
Mamoon (son) of deceased Rehmatullah who stated that
they have patched up the matter with all the accused
including absconding accused and pardoned them in the
name of Allah Almighty by waiving of their rights of Qisas
and Diyat. The learned Court also recorded the statement of
Faridullah, son of deceased Zar'Muhammnad. He stated his
father Zar Muhammad was murdered and to this effect,
report was lodged by Mst. Gul Nooran Bibi who charged
accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Fazal Rehman, Haji
Gulab, Abdur Rehman and'Muhammad Khan. He further
stated that he has patched up the matter with the accused
party and pardoned them ‘ini the name of Allah Almighty.
Similarly, joint statement of Mst- Shahida Bibi (widow)
and Mst. Gul Sarwara Bibi (mother) of deceased Zar
Muhammad was recorded) who also stated to have patched

up the matter with the; accused’ party. Thereafter, the

learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, D.I.Khan acquitted
accused Gul Rehman alias Bilal, Gulab Khan and Fazal

Rehman and declared accused Muhammad Khan alias

Muhammad as proclaimed offender and issued perpetual 0 Ros

warrant of arrest against him vide judgment dated
23.01.2017, hence the instant criminal revision by

complainant Mst. Gul Noora.

3. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the petitioner and the learned Addl: A.G

representing the State and have gone through the record.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the offences with
which the accused including the absconder are charged, are
legally compoundable. The legal heirs of both the deceased
and the injured categorically stated in their statements
before the learned trial Curt that they have patched up the

matter with the accused facing trial and the absconding
accused, have pardoned them in the name of Allah
Almighty and have no objection if they are acquitted on the
basis of compromise. Under Islamic law, there is no
provision that in any case of a compoundable offence, the
accused person can be forgiven only and only when he
agrees to being forgiven. There is an example that when the
Holy Prophet (S. A.W.W) visited Taif and the street
urchins of Taif, upon instigations by the notables of Taif,
pelted Holy Prophet with stones and according to
historians, so-much so that the blood of the Holy Prophet

dropped into his shoes, the Holy Prophet instead of praying

for God’s wrath angers upon the residents of Taif, forgave

and prayed for their forgiveness. Keeping in view such
golden Islamic principles, it;would not be in the interes! at
justice to indulge ourselves into technicalities that accused
Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad was an outlaw and did
not appear either before the] investigating agency or betore
the Court. When legal heirs of both the deceased and the
injured have settled their differences also with accused
Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad, the order of learned

|
trial Court issuing perpetual warrant of arrest against him ts

legally incorrect and not sustainable. Reliance in this
respect can be placed on the case of Muhammad Nawaz

and others. Vs. State 1998 ML D- J Lahore).

5. For the reasons mentioned above, we allow the
instant criminal revision, set aside the impugned judgment
dated 23.01.2017 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV.
D.I.Khan to the extent of issuance of perpetual warrant of
arrest against accused Muhammad Khan alias Muhammad
