ABDUL LATIF KHAN, J:- Petitioner Qazi Mubashar
Saeed alias Qazi Mubashar Islam seeks post arrest
bail in case FIR No.339 dated 29.9.2013 u/s 324/34
PPC, P.S. KTS, District Haripur.

2. It is pertinent to mention that the bail
petition of petitioner has been dismissed thrice on
merit as well as statutory delay by this Court vide
orders dated 9.12.2013, 22.12.2014 & 09.03.2015 now
the petitioner seeks bail on the ground of non-
compliance of orders of this Court, wherein the trial
Court was directed to conclude the trial within the
stipulated period mentioned therein.

Arguments heard and record perused.
3. While dismissing the bail petition of
petitioner on the ground of statutory delay, by this
Court vide order dated 22.12.2014, direction to the
learned trial Court was issued for conclusion of trial
within a period of one month. Due to non-conclusion of
trial of petitioner within the said period, the petitioner
again approached this Court wherein vide order dated
09.03.2015, direction to the trial Court was again
issued for examination of remaining witnesses on
14.3.2015 and it was also ordered that in case of non-
conclusion of trial on the part of prosecution, the
petitioner will be within his right to approach this Court
and in that case plea for release of accused will be
considered on its own merits notwithstanding the
earlier order/observations of this Court in previous
application for bail of petitioner on statutory ground.
But perusal of order sheet dated 14.3.2015 as well as
report of trial Court depicts that one witness Qazi
Serajul Haq was examined as PW.9 on the same date
but when the learned trial Court directed for recording
statement of PW. Muhammad Arif SI, who was also
present in Court, the learned defence counsel pointed

out to the trial Court at 2.00 PM, that the Court time is
over, therefore on his behalf the case was adjourned
which delay has not been caused on the part of
prosecution as witness was present and Court timing is
not till 2.00 PM, therefore, adjournment was made on
the part of learned defence counsel for which
prosecution or trial Court cannot be blamed. Besides,
only one witness is left to be examined meaning
thereby that the trial would be concluded within a
shortest possible time. At present no case for bail of
petitioner is made out nor there is anything on record
that the order of this Court has been violated by the
trial Court therefore the instant petition is dismissed.
However the trial Court is directed to examine the
remaining witnesses on 9.4.2015 positively without any
further adjournments. The prosecution is also directed
to procure attendance of unexamined witnesses
positively for the date fixed and thereafter the case be
decided on day to day basis within a period of one
month on merit strictly in accordance with law. The
office is directed to send the record of trial Court
immediately.

Announced.
