4. On completion of the investigation, the matter

PWs including complainant. The prosecution windup
its account and the learned trial Court confronted the

during the trial through a questionnaire & examined
u/s 342 Cr.P.C. However, the accused neither wish to
be examined on oath u/s 340 Cr.P.C nor opted to

prosecution has successfully bring home charge
against the accused, as such, the appellant/accused
was convicted & sentenced to: -
(a)u/s 387 PPC for 05 years RI with fine of Rs:

or 08 days SI in default of payment of fine.

However, benefit of 382-B Cr.P.C was
extended to the appellant with remarks that the subject

sentences shall run concurrently.

6. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
7. Admittedly, the case of the prosecution

against the appellant/accused pertaining to demand of
Donation (Bhatta) allegedly, find its origin from the
cell phone (0304-9267787) calls by the
appellant/accused to the complainant/victim on his
cell phone #0345-9099820. Close perusal of the cell
phone data Exh.PW4/7 would transpire about the fact
pertaining to a cell phone call from cell # 0345-
9099820 dated 30.03.2021 at 21:07.02 hours. The
record prima facie falsify the allegations of the

complainant/respondent pertaining to the threat calls

for the simple reason that only a single call from the
alleged cell number of the accused/appellant to the
cell number of the complainant/respondent is floating
on surface of the record.

8. During the investigation an iota of
evidence has not been collected at all which could
prima facie speak of the fact that sim having its
registration No.0304-9267787 is in the name of the
appellant/accused. The Court is conscious enough that
the subject sim number may be registered in the name
of the appellant/accused but it shall not skip the
attention of the Court that record of call data
Exh.PW4/8 so furnished only speak of the cellular
connectivity of the appellant/accused and
respondent/complainant only on 30.03.2021, whereas,
the event has been reported to the local police on
08.04.2021 followed by registration of the case vide
FIR No.11 dated 08.04.2021. On record, no plausible
excuse or explanation regarding the delay of almost
eight (08) days despite the fact that the accused was
allegedly conscious enough that the subject
threatening calls for “Bhatta” was received more than
a week ago and it left behind wider scope of
consultation & deliberation may amount to guilty

conscious on his part. No doubt, PW-2 Yar Gul also
~ we

spoke about the call for donation/chanda/Bhatta but
has not disclosed the name of the caller.

9. There is no denial to the factum that not
only the complainant/respondent but even the
supporting witness have categorically highlighted in
their respective accounts that the calls in question
were for contribution of funds for the welfare of the
unattended segment of the society, orphans widows
ete.

10. Apart from the above, the complainant
allegedly received not multiple rather numerous calls
of the appellant/accused and it is Gospel Truth that
the Cellular Phone does have the option of recording
the conversation with the incoming caller. The
allegations of the respondent/complainant pertain to
numerous calls on part of the appellant/accused since
March, 2021 till October, 2021, on this count he had a
long breathing space and could have the option to
avail due assistance from a person well conversant
with the function of cellular phone so that the alleged
threats attributed to the accused/appellant could have
been recorded. Not to do so, it prima facie speak of
the fact that the allegations of the

complainant/respondent are tinted with doubt.
11. An iota of evidence has not been led by
the prosecution to prove any link/nexus of the
appellant/accused with a commission of offence.

12. The evidence led by the prosecution is
suffering from material contradictions and
discrepancies which make the prosecution case highly
doubtful, and, benefit of the same should have been
extended to the appellant, but the learned trial Court
by not appreciating the evidence in its true
perspective, reached to a wrong conclusion by
holding the appellant guilty of the offence. It has been
held, umpteenth times by the superior courts, that a
slightest doubt occurs in the prosecution case is

sufficient to grant acquittal to an accused “Muhammad

Akram Vs. State (2009 SCMR 230) Khalid Mahmood vs.
State (2011 SCMR 664), Tahir Khan Vs. State (2011
SCMR 646), Nazim Khan Vs, State (1984 PLD SC 433),
Farman Ahmad Vs. Muhammad Inayat (2007 SCMR

1825). The conclusions drawn by the learned trial
Court are not borne out of the case evidence therefore,
the impugned judgment is not sustainable in the eye
of law.

13. Accordingly, for the forgoing reasons, the
appeal is allowed. Conviction and sentences of the

appellant recorded by the learned trial Court through
impugned judgment is hereby set-aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges leveled against
him. He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required to
be detained in any other case.
