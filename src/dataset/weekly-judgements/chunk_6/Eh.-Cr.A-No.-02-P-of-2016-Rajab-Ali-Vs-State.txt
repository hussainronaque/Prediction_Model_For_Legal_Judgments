The the amount of fine has been directed to be

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the
instant appeals are that appellant Rajab Ali joined police
Department as a Constable in District Kohat, since
03.07.1994. During his service till 13.08.2013, he was
promoted up to DSP. He was posted as SHO Police Station
Hayatabad, Peshawar, when complaints were made against
to this Court qua misuse of his official authority i.e.
detaining innocent citizens in his torture cells for the
purpose of grabbing money from them. Similarly,
W.P.No.432-P of 2012, was filed before this Court by
Mst. Mamala Bibi for release of her son Sadam Khan,
allegedly kept in illegal confinement by appellant Rajab Ali.
Prior to the aforesaid writ petition, Mst. Mamala Bibi, had
also filed W.P. No.119/2012, for release of her minor son
Iqbal Hussain, illegally detained by appellant-SHO Rajab
Ali. This Court while issuing release order of her son,
simultaneously directed the learned Sessions Judge,
Peshawar, to conduct thorough inquiry into the matter. In
this view of the matter, appellant Rajab Ali allegedly
abducted another son of the petitioner, namely, Saddam so
as to pressurized her for settlement in the aforesaid W.P.
No.119/2012. Taking the above circumstances, on
20.03.2012, this Court passed the following order in Writ
Petition No.432-P/2012:-

“Two separate enquiry reports have been
received. In both, it has been concluded that
Rajab Ali SHO Police Station Hayatabad is
consistently indulging in unlawful and
illegal activities by abusing and misusing his
official position, getting ransom from
innocent people arrested in false case, is
running and maintaining three private
torture cells where such people, illegally
arrested and detained, are kept and are put to
torture and in lieu thereof gets handsome
ransom amount. The present case is a
testimony to this fact where as pre-teenager
was tortured with extreme brutalities. He has
made his fortune through ill gotten gains, as
reported in the enquiry reports and
accumulated unmatchable and
disproportionate assets both moveable and
immovable in this Province, in Rawalpindi
and Islamabad and is also involved in
immoral activities. To give fair chance of
defence to the SHO, he is directed to file
written reply to the enquiry reports and the
allegations made against him within seven
days, positively.

In the meanwhile, Director Genearl NAB
is directed to constitute a team of experts
who shall investigate into the allegations
contained in these reports and shall submit
periodical report to the Court. The experts
tea shall chase the moveable and immovable
assets of the SHO and shall detect all his
hidden assets as well and in case he is found
involved in accumulation of weal through
illegal means or ill gotten gains then proper
reference will be prepared against him in
due course.”

3. In pursuance of this Court order, the Director
General National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, took cognizance in the matter and ordered
inquiry/investigation. During investigation it was unearth
that appellant Rajab Ali while serving in Police Department,
since 1994 to 2013, has accumulated moveable and
immovable assets/properties through illegal means/modes at
his own name, value of which comes to Rs.1,46,88,056/-,
which is disproportionate to his legal known sources of

income. Detail of those proprieties are under:_

S.No. | Description of Assets Purchase Ill-gotten
value in | amount in
rupees rupees
1. 15 Marlas land in Mouza | 9,52,285 861,818
Lala & its construction cost.

2. 04 Kanal land in Mouza | 13,36,795 1209609

3. Partial construction of | 65,60,360 62,27,963

4. Partial construction of | 65,60,360 63,88,666
bungalow in moza Thatta
Khalil (cost of construction

(Years 2012)
Total ill gotten money Rs.1,46,88,056
4. Appellant Rajab Ali was arrested by the NAB

authorities on 18.04.2014. During interrogation, he, in order
to justify his alleged illegal assets, produced
agreement/affidavit No.2551 and 2552 dated 05.09.2011
(Exh.PW.30/1) to the Investigation Team of the NAB in
respect of sale of his ancestral property measuring 80
Kanals and 10 Marlas land in Moza Tezana Kurram Agency
in favour of co-appellant Latif Hussain in lieu of
Rs.1,40,00,000/-. Since, the said affidavit was apparently
attested by Muhammad Yousaf Kareem, the then Tehsildar
Mahal Kurram Agency (PW.30), therefore, he was
associated with the investigation, who on confrontation with
said document Exh.PW.30/1, denied his signature as
attesting Officer over it. His statement to this effect was
recorded and he was also produced for recording his
statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. Similarly, his Specimen
Signatures were obtained and sent to the FSL along with
Exh.PW.30/1, which as per FSL report, were found to be
fake and forged. It is further alleged by the prosecution that
the stance of the appellant was also denied by the revenue
hierarchy of Kurram Agency and was also in contrast with
of his reply filed by him in W.P. No.432/2012, as in his
reply the appellant Rajb Ali has categorically stated that he
and his family has got 120 Kanals ancestral cultivable
property in Parachinar and he had not stated a single word
about impugned sale of 80 Kanals land to co-appellant Latif
Hussain. The NAB authorities allegedly found the appellant
failed to provide any cogent proof of money trail from
co-appellant Latif Hussain viz Bank.

5. Co-appellant Latif Hussain was initially associated
by the inquiry/investigation officer as witness, but
subsequently was arrayed as an accused on the accusations
that he being the close friend of appellant Rajab Ali
introduced himself as purchaser of 80 Kanals land i.e. the
ancestral property of the Rajab Ali vide Exh.PW.30/1 in
Moza Tezana Kurram Agency, so as to save his skin. In this
way abetted appellant Rajab Ali in preparation of
fake/fabricated affidavit/sale deed Exh.PW.30/1,
owned/stood by the contents of the said deed and thereby
misguided the Investigating Team of the NAB.

6. Appellant Latif Hussain was arrested and on
completion of investigation, supplementary challan was
submitted against him in Accountability Reference No.7 of
2012. Both the appellants were charge sheeted by the
learned Trial Court, to which they pleaded not guilty and
claimed Trial. In order to prove its case, prosecution/NAB
examined as many as 34 witnesses. After closure of the
prosecution evidence, statements of the appellants were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C., wherein they denied the
prosecution allegations and professed their innocence.
Appellant Rajab Ali denied to be examined on oath under
section 340 (2) Cr.P.C., however, opted to produce evidence
in defence. Same was the option of co-appellant Latif
Hussain.

7. Arif Hussain, Gulfam Hussain, Muhammad Ashraf
Malik (Rtd DIG Police Services of Pakistan), Safar Ali and,
Muhammad Nazar, were produced as DW.1 to DW.5,
respectively. Later on, appellant Rajab Ali did wish to be
examined on oath. Accordingly, his statement under section
340 (2) Cr.P.C., was recorded on 4.01.2016 and 8.01.2016.

On closure of the defence evidence, learned Trial Court,
after hearing both the sides, convicted and sentenced the
appellants as mentioned above, hence, these appeals.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant at the begin of
occupying the rostrum and addressing his arguments,
delineated the family background and social status of the
appellant Rajab Ali. By presenting the summery of
accumulation of assets coupled with his family tree, the
worthy counsel argued that appellant Rajab Ali has four
brothers and four sisters; that appellant along with his
brothers are still residing jointly bearing the expenses and
saving together; that father of the appellant was owner of
120 Kanals land since 1909 in Kurram Agency. The
appellant inducted in Police department as Constable in the
year 1994 and on the basis of his excellent and brilliant
performance, was not only awarded medals but was also
bestowed with accelerated promotion. In the year 2001 the
appellant was promoted as Head Constable, in the year 2005
as Assistant Sub-inspector, in the year 2007, as Deputy
Sub-Inspector, in the year 2011, as Inspector and finally in
the year 2014, as Deputy Superintendent of Police; that
during his service tenure, he remained posted in different
districts of the province including Hangu, Kohat, Pehsawar,
Charsadda, Bannu, Nowshera, Swabi and Marndan and by
virtue of his bravery he was always given the hard tasks,
that too, in the hard areas having worst law and order
situations; that the appellant as a Police Officer fought
against the terrorists and anti state elements on front line,
therefore, his enemies/Anti state elements in order to malign
and restrained him from his obligation submitted frivolous
and baseless complaints against him to his superiors as well
as Court of law; that in the year 2001, Shaban Ali, the elder
brother of the appellant, went to Saudi Arabi for earning
livelihood, hence, the responsibility of looking after the

agriculture property and other business came on the
shoulders of his other younger brother Safar Ali; that after
demise of father of the appellant in the year 2006, his other
younger brother Liaqat Ali also proceeded to Saudia Arabia
for earning livelihood; that in the year 2008 when the law
and order situation became worst in the entire tribal belt,
including the native village of the appellant, the inhabitants
of the area started migrating to settled areas, hence, the
appellant and his brothers also decided to shift to Peshawar
along with families for peaceful and better life. In this view
of the matter, they purchased 15 Marals land in village Lala
Kale in lieu of sale consideration of Rs.1,50,000/-, which
amount was given to the appellant by his brother Safar Ali.
A house was constructed on the said land by the appellant
from the joint kitty of all the brothers. Due to threats to the
life of the appellant, he and his brothers decided to find out
a place for construction of house in some peaceful area,
consequently, their relative Haji Muhammad Nazar, who
was dealing in the property business at Islamabad, found a
place on reasonable price for them in village Thatta Khalil,
Taxil. The sale transaction of 4 Kanlas land was finalized by
brother of the appellant with Nazar Hussain from joint kitty
of the brothers in the year 2008, however, the mutation was
attested in the name of the appellant. The appellant and his
brothers decided to sell their ancestral land for getting
amount to construct house on land in the Taxila. A sale
transaction of 80 Kanals land in this regard was struck with
co-appellant Latif Hussain against sale consideration of
Rs.1,40,00,000/- vide sale deed Exh.PW.301/1. Since,
inheritance mutation of the aforesaid ancestral land of the
appellant and his brothers was not yet attested therefore, as a
precautionary measures the aforesaid agreement to sell was
executed; that out of total sale consideration, Latif Hussain
paid rupees one coror to Arif Hussain vide deed

Exh.PW.30/1. The deed was also singed by Latif Hussain
vendee, as well as marginal witnesses, namely, Arif
Hussain and Gulfam Hussain, (examined as DWs); that the
aforesaid deed was attested by Muhammad Youaf Kareem
the then Tehsildar Mahal Kurram after verifying the land
from the revenue record, but the mutation could not be
attested due to restraint of the NAB authorites, which is still
“Zair-e-Tajweez”; that Safar Ali completed partial
construction of the house on the land at Thatta Khalil in the
year 2011 while NAB authorities started digging in the
matter through inquiry/investigation against the appellant
Rajab Ali, in 2012, qua alleged misuse of his powers while
serving in police department, but could not collect any
evidence against him, hence, started investigation into
acquisition of the house at Thatta Khalil and by then only
roof (lunter) on the basement was completed. The learned
counsel for the appellant went on to say that construction
and acquisition was not on the basis of ill gotten money and
had it been so, the appellant would not have proceeded with
the onward construction. Indeed the house was held by the
appellant and his brothers, jointly and the construction was
being raised from the joint kitty, therefore, the appellant and
his brothers did not stop the construction; that during
investigation, the NAB authorities pressurized Yousaf
Karim Tehsildar to disown his signature on Exh.PW.30/1.
While summarizing his arguments, worthy counsel
for the appellants contended that NAB authorities has
conducted dishonest investigation in the case as the I.O. has
intentionally not recorded the statements of marginal
witnesses of the alleged disputed deed while the appellant
Rajab Ali has squarely proved his and his brothers’ legal
sources on the basis of which they have jointly constructed
the questioned house. The sale transaction regarding 80
Kanals land i.e. the ancestral property of the appellant Rajab

Ali has been proved from the prosecution evidence and the
sale consideration received by the appellant his brothers are
sufficient to meet with the construction expenses of the
house. The co-appellant Latif Hussain has not denied the
stance of the appellant Rajab Ali rather from the very
inception till date he is stuck to his stance that he has
purchased 80 Kanals ancestral property of the appellant and
his brothers vide deed Exh.PW.301/1; that the financial
position of Latif Hussain has not been disputed by the
prosecution, who on the day of execution of the dispute
agreement to sell has also entered into sale transactions with
other people and has made payment in cash, therefore,
question of the money trail via bank etc, would not advance
the prosecution case, particularly, when the witnesses of the
deed admit payment to the appellant and his brothers in cash
by Latif Hussain; that on the basis of the disputed agreement
to sell, mutation has been entered in the revenue record and
this fact is proved from the prosecution evidence. That it
could not be attested due to restraint by the NAB authorities
due to present proceedings. He argued with vehemence that
if the impugned sale is taken out from consideration, even
then, the income of the appellant and his brothers from their
ancestral cultivable property till 2012, as per assessment of
the NAB authorities coupled with their monthly salaries, are
sufficient to prove the expenses of purchase and
construction of the houses in question. He added that
sufficient evidence has been brought by the prosecution
itself which proves that appellant and his brothers are
residing jointly and their saving and expenses are joint; that
it is proved from the available evidence that two brothers of
the appellant are serving in Saudi Arabi and getting
handsome salary upto 6000 Saudi Riyals each. He closed his
submissions by stating that the learned Trial Court while
ignoring material evidence placed on file, particularly, the

evidence produced by the appellant in defence, has arrived
10

at an erroneous conclusion by holding the appellants guilty
of the offence, hence, the same is liable to be set aside and
the appellants be acquitted of the charges.

9. Conversely, learned Special Prosecutor for the
NAB while controverting the submissions of learned
counsel for the appellants contended that sufficient
documentary and oral evidence has been brought on record
by the prosecution to prove the illegal assets of the
appellants and the sale deed Exh.PW.30/1 to be a fake
document, hence, the learned Trial Court was justified by
holding the appellants guilty of the offence, to which no
exception can be taken. He, thus, sought dismissal of the
appeals.

10. We have considered the respective submissions
advanced from both the sides and perused the record with
their able assistance.

11. Accusation against appellant Rajab Ali is that he
being a public servant accumulated various immovable
properties which are disproportionate to his salary,
emoluments and other known legal sources. The properties
allegedly accumulated by the appellant are (1) purchase of
15 Marlas land in Moza Lala, Peshawar, and construction of
a house thereon. The NAB authorities have assessed the
purchased value of the said property and construction
thereon as Rs.9,52,285/- out of which Rs.86181/- has been
declared as ill gotten gain of the appellant (2) purchase of
04 Kanals land in Moza Thatta Khailil, purchased value of
which has been assessed as Rs. 13,36,795/-, out of which
Rs.12,09609/- has been declared as ill gotten money of the
appellant (3) Partial construction of bungalow in Moza
Thatta Khalil on the aforesaid area on Rs. 65,60,360/-, out
of which Rs.62, 27,963/-, has been assessed as ill-gotten
money of the appellant and (4) Remaining construction of

the said bungalow at a cost of Rs.65,60,360/-, out of which
11

Rs.63,88,666/-, has been assessed and declared as ill-gotten
money of the appellant. In this way Rs.1,46,88,056/-, has
been assessed as the total ill gotten/unjustified money on the
part of the appellant by the NAB authorities.
12. Before to reappraise the evidence available on
record, we, would first refer to Section 5 of the NAO, 1999,
wherein word “Assets” has been defined under subsection
(c ), which read as under:-
“Assets” means any property owned,
controlled by or belonging to any accused,
whether directly or indirectly, or held benami
in the name of his spouse or relatives or
associates, whether within or outside Pakistan
which he cannot reasonably account for, or for
which he cannot prove payment of full and
lawful consideration.”
Section 9 (a) subsection (v), of NAO, 1999, enumerates that
a holder of a public Office or any other person, is said to
commit or to have committed the offence of corruption and
corrupt practices, if he or any of his dependents or
benamidars owns, possesses, or has acquired right or title in
any assets or holds irrevocable power of attorney in respect
of any assets or pecuniary resources disproportionate to his
known sources of income, which he cannot reasonably
account for or maintains a standard of living beyond that
which is commensurate with his sources of income. No
doubt, under section 14 (c ) of the NAO, 1999, in any trial
of an offence punishable under clause (v) of subsection (a)
of section 9 of the Ordinance, the fact that the accused
person or any other person on his behalf, is in possession,
for which the accused person cannot satisfactorily account,
of his known sources of income, or that such person has, at
or about the time of the commission of the offence with
which he is charged, obtained an accretion to his pecuniary

resources or property for which he cannot satisfactorily

account, the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is
12

proved, that the accused person is guilty of the offence of
corruption and corrupt practices and his conviction
therefore shall not be invalid by reason only that it is based
solely on such a presumption. However, every accused who
faces trial in the Accountability Court or against whom a
Reference has been sent, the presumption as envisaged in
section 14 of NAO, 1999, cannot be convicted for the
simple reason that section 14 NAO, 1999, cannot be used to
undermine the rule of law that save in every, exceptional
class of cases the burden to prove the guilt of an accused
always rests on the prosecution and it does not cast any
burden on an accused person to prove that no crime was
committed by him by proving facts specifically within his
knowledge nor does it warrant the conclusion that if
anything is unexplained which the Court thinks the accused
could explain he ought therefore to be found guilty.
Ordinary rule that applies to criminal trials viz that the onus
lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is
not in any way modified by the rule of evidence contained
in S.14 of NAO 1999 which cannot be used to make up for
the inability of the prosecution to produce evidence of
circumstances necessary to prove the guilt of the accused. It
is only in cases where the facts proved by the evidence give
rise to a reasonable inference of guilt unless the same is
rebutted that such inference can be negative by proof of
some fact which in its nature can only be within the special
knowledge of the accused. If the prosecution fails to prove
the essential ingredients of the offence, no duty is cast on
the accused to prove his innocence. Presumption under S.14
of NAO, 1999 is that Court is required to presume if
prosecution proves that accused is guilty of offence of
corruption and corrupt practices on the condition that
prosecution proves the ingredients of clause (a)(v) of

section 9 of NAO 1999.
13

13. Taking the case in hand, at the touch stone of the
principles referred above, we would evaluate the
prosecution evidence so as to determine whether it has
successfully performed its primary duty, if, yes, whether the
appellants by rebutting the prosecution evidence, have
proved their innocence. For this purpose, a precise resume
of evidence of parties would be necessary, which run as
below:

Danishwar Khan SSP, Special Branch, Head

In cross examination, this witness admitted Mir
Ahmad Khan to be the father of the appellant Rajab
Ali and Ali Noor as his grandfather and that as per
revenue record the predecessor of Rajab Ali, are
recorded as land owners of ancestral property in the
area since 1905 1.e. for the last 110 years according to
first settlement in Kurram Agency. He deposed that
on the basis of Goshawarajat mentioned above about
the produce of the ancestral property of the appellant

since 2001 to Rabi 2012, the net saving income of
16

Rajab Ali comes to Rs.10,15,067/- and similar that of
his brothers. that the total proportionate share under
the produce of all the five brothers comes to more
than 50 laces rupees during this period. He admits that
he has not prepared the proportionate share and the
income of father of the appellant w.e.f. 1950 to 2012,
therefore, he cannot say as to what would be the
average yearly income under produce of the land
owned by father of the appellant to his extent. He
further admitted that he has included the income of
Bosarajat (straw heap) of the property of the
appellants and his brothers for the last 12 years in the
aforesaid Goshwarajat, therefore, cannot say the exact
value of per straw heap stock. He stated that he does
not know per mound price of straw heap in Kurram
Agency, however, admitted the fact that the area
where ancestral property of the appellant is situated is
famous for different types of fruits like pomegranate
and apples. He showed his ignorance about orchards
of pomegranates over an area of 20 Kanals of the
appellant’s property nor he has shown the same in the
Goshwarajat nor has assessed any price of the same.
He categorically admitted that appellant Rajab Ali and
his brothers are members of joint family and property
of their predecessor is still jointly held as per revenue
record. He, however, showed his ignorance about sale
of the ancestral property by the appellants in favour of
co-appellant Latif Hussain. While going through the
statement of this PW we observe that had he assessed
the market price of the straw heaps of 10 years and the
saving of the appellant’s father till his death as well as
the assessment of the export quality fruit of
pomegranate, which factum is established from the

revenue record that on area of 20 Kanals there are
17

orchards of pomegranate, the share of income of the
appellant and his brothers as assessed by this PWs
would not be upto fifty laces rupees but more than one
corore, particularly, keeping in view the market price
of pomegranate.

Ashiq Ali Patwari Halgqa appeared as PW.12.
He produced revenue record for the year 2009-2010

2009-2010 Exh.PW.12/2, original Jamanbamdi for the
year 1943-44 of the same Moza Exh.PW.12/3,

original Register Khasra Girdawari from Kharif 2001
till Rabi 2012 of Moaza Tezana, Yousaf Khel and
Masto Khel Exh.PW.12/8.

In cross-examination this witness also admitted
the ancestral property of the appellant Rajab Ali and
the status of the land to be “Self cultivated”. He
deposed that the land in question bear two types of
crops i.e. Fasl-e-Rabi and Fasle-Kharif and produce
all types of seasonal crops of Rabi and Kharif; that
land of appellant Rajab Ali cultivable for all types of
seasonable crops including fruits, and that he had
mentioned those types of crops like wheat, onion,
shaftal, Mattar (beans), Potatoes, rice, Tomato,
Cucumber, Peanuts. He stated the land in question has
got a lot of planted trees of various kinds; that he is
not in the knowledge of the fact that how many times

during the preceding 10 years appellant and his
18

brothers have sold out trees and its branches from
their land. He admitted that he has not shown the
income of straw heap, Palala etc as there was no
specific column in the relevant printed Khasra
Girdawari. This witness showed his ignorance about
orchards of Pomegranate over an area of 05 Jareebs,
but he was confronted with all the Jamabandies and
Khasra Girdawaris where such orchards are
mentioned, he could not wriggle out of the situation.

He admitted the house of the appellant to be Kacha

built and is owned by them jointly. He deposed that

initially the total ownership of the appellant and his
brothers was 99 Kanals but on rechecking of the
record it was found to be 106 Kanals and 03 Marals.
In light of statement of this PW, we are of the
considered view that if the produce and income of the
pomegranate over an area of 05 Jareebs for a period of
10 years along with the trees and branches, had been
assessed, the income of the appellants and his brothers
from their ancestral property would have not been the
one as assessed by this PW.

Zulfigar Ali Patwari (PW.14), produced record
of mutations No.2877, 2878 and 2879 of Moza Pind

In cross-examination he deposed that the
number of buyers in mutation No.5973 is fifteen
including appellant Rajab Ali and the share of Rajab
Ali comes to 03 Kanals only. He stated that sale
consideration of the entire mutation in the name of

fifteen persons is recorded as Rs.58,00,000/-; but he
19

cannot say that on calculation the sale consideration
paid by Rajab Ali appellant for 60 Marlas i.e. 03
Kanals would come to less than Rs.3,00,000/-. He
further stated the numbers of buyers of land
mentioned in mutation No.5974 of Moza Thatta
Khalil are thirteen and the sale consideration
collectively comes to Rs.26,00,000/-. He admitted that
sale consideration paid by Rajab Ali for his due share

time was Rs.11,68,618/- which was the depreciated
costs. He further deposed that he also visited village
Tattah Khalil Taxila for assessment of the house

owned by appellant which by then was under

construction, therefore, after evaluating the cost of
material used, he furnished his report Exh.PW.16/4,
according to which, the cost incurred at that time was
worked out to the tune of Rs.65,60,360/-. He stated
that completion of the construction of the aforesaid
house, the NAB authorities again directed him for re-
assessment of the market value of the said house.
Accordingly, on 15.05.2014, he along with NAB
officers and brothers of appellant Rajab Ali visited the
house and furnished complete assessment report
Exh.PW.16/8, according to which the total cost of
construction was worked out to the tune of
Rs.1,57,44,864/- vide Exh.PW.16/9.

In cross-examination he deposed that he is
graduate Civil Engineer from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
University Engineering and Technology; that he is
qualified engineer, but he is not specialized
because specialization in any one of the related
subjects require higher’ studies of  P.hd.
engineering or M.Sc in Engineering; that after
graduation he has not carried out any research work in

his field. He stated that so far qualification as Civil

Engineer is concerned, he holds the same but so far

the expertise and technical knowledge of evaluation is

concerned, he does not possess any specialized degree

in the said field. He further admitted that during those
days in all the three divisions of Pak PWD under the

control of Superintending Engineer, there were many

senior officers available who were more experienced

persons than him. (Under line for emphasis). From the

statement of this witness it is evident that he was not
expert, therefore, the assessment made by him cannot

be relied upon.
21

Shehryar ASI (PW.17), produced list of 25
vehicles Exh.PW.17/l, kept in Police Station
Hayatabad being case property in criminal cases. In

Zahir Hussain Bangash Political Moharrir
appeared as PW.20. He deposed that on the direction
of the NAB authorities, he inquired about the family
of appellant Rajab Ali and in this respect prepared
report Exh.PW.20/1. In cross-examination he deposed
22

that he visited the grave of father of appellant namely
Mir Ahmad Khan for verification of date of his death;
that he has mentioned the date of death of father of the
appellant as 18.07.2006 and the father of the appellant

direction to collect information about number of
brothers of the accused, his family status, family
members and property owned by the appellant and his
brothers; that he belongs to Bangash cast whereas
appellant belongs to Tori Mastokhel cast; that both the
casts are at daggers drawn due to landed and other
disputes; that he has correctly mentioned the number
of the brothers of Rajab Ali i.e. Shaban Ali, Safar Ali,
Liaqat Ali and Mujahid Hussain. This witness also

categorically admitted that appellant and his brothers

are living in a joint family system and their profit and

loss is one and the same. Further deposed that he has

not mentioned in his report about duration of stay,
nature of their profession and their earning, however,

he was told by the elders of the locality that brothers

of the appellant are serving abroad for the last 15/16

years in Saudia Arabia. Though he has mentioned in

his report about the ancestral property of appellant
Rajab Ali to be considerably sufficient but has not
given the exact area in terms of Kanals, Jareeb. The
entire property is cultivable as he was not asked by
the NAB to ascertain the present status of the
ancestral land of Rajab Ali, therefore, he did not
report about the sale of land of Rajab Ali and his
brothers in favour of Latif Hussain. He admitted that a

person having more than 100 Kanal cultivable land in

Kuram Agency is considered notable and elder of the

23

area; that Latif Hussain is known to him who deals in

property and is a fruit and vegetable merchant.

24

Muhammad Yousaf Karim on the disputed stamp
paper No.2552 dated 05.09.2011 Exh.PW.30/1, does

never travelled from Pakistan to abroad as per his
report Exh.PW.27/2.

Zahid Younas Political Naib Tehsildar Bara
Khyber Agency appeared as PW.28. He deposed that
during the relevant days he was posted as Tehsildar
Mahal Upper Kurram Agency and on the instruction
of NAB authorities, he provided revenue record in
respect of appellant Rajab Ali and attested the report
of Pawari Halqa as well as Khasra Girdawari of circle
Karhman including three Mauzajat prepared by the
concerned Patwari Halqa already Exh.PW.12/7
already Exh.PW.12/8.

In cross-examination he deposed that it is
correct that the name of Mir Ahmad Khan father of
appellant Rajab Ali is recorded in the Pedegree-table
as owner in its forth generation; that appellant, his
brothers and sisters are the owners in its fifth

generation. He admitted that sisters of Rajab Ali have

gifted their respective due shares in their ancestral

property of their father in favour of their brothers

Ali and Mujahid Ali along with their due share in

Shamilat_ land of Mozajat vide mutations No.677
dated 26.03.2012 Exh.PW.11/10).
Syed Noman Ali Shah Political Tehsildar

Bajaur Agency while appearing as PW.29, deposed
that during those days he was posted as Tehsildar
Mahal Kurram Agency; that he forwarded the report
of Patwari and Field Qanoongo Exh.P:W.13/1 to APA
Upper Kurram and Jarh Pedawar of land owned by
Mir Ahmad Khan father of Rajab Ali in three different
26

Mozajat i.e. Tizana, Mastokhel and Yousafkhel and
forward the same to APA.

In cross examination he deposed that he had not
verified these documents through spot inspection
before its forwarding to the APA. He admitted that
this Goshwara Jarh Pedawar is for three years only i.e.

2012-2014. In reply to a question of defence, this PW

deposed that attestation of mutations are of two kinds

ie. Zair-e-Tajweez, and Ready for attestation; that the

mutation from the side of Rajab Ali and his brothers

in favour of Latif Hussain was Zair-e-Tajweez being

already entered but was not attested because of the

commencement of an inquiry against Rajab Ali by the

NAB, and direction of NAB authorities through a

letter_to political Agency Kuram that sale and

purchase transaction in ancestral property of Rajab Ali

and his brothers and sisters should not be attested.

Muhammad Yousaf Karim Additional Assistant
Commissioner Tank, who is the star witness with
regard to sale transaction between the appellants,
appeared as PW.30. As per his deposition, he
remained as Political Tehsildar Mahal Kurram
Agency for about 16 months i.e. from July 2010 to
December, 2011 and during his tenure apart from
routine duty of Political Administration he was also
perfuming the duties of Tehsildar Revenue as well as
Sub-Registrar. He explained that there were three

modes of transfer of property in Kurram Agency ,i.e.

through mutation, through registered deed or through

sale deed on judicial stamp paper duly attested by

Tehsildar. The procedure for attestation of sale deed
which was in vogue during his tenure was that when
the parties i.e. vendor and vendee came for attestation

of sale deed, he used to mark it to his subordinate staff
27

for verification and after the report and verification,
he used to attest the mutation by calling the parties.
He admitted the fact that he has seen the impugned
agreement to sell Exh.PW.30/1. Since, it does not
bear any report or verification of his subordinate staff
therefore, the signature available on it is not that of
him; that his specimen signatures were obtained for
comparison with the signature over the disputed deed
Exh.PW.30/1. He admitted slight difference in his
specimen signatures.

Gul Sahib Khan appeared as PW.31,
Mst. Dilbar Sultana wife of Darvesh Khan (PW.32)
and Muhammad Munir (PW.33), narrated the stories
of cruelty of appellant Rajab Ali and the account
allegedly grabbed by the appellant, but without any
solid proof. Since, we are confronted with the case of
illegal assets, therefore, we are least interest with the
cruelty of the appellant, that too, when nothing
material has been brought on record in this regard.

The prosecution got examined; Muhammad
Kamran Deputy Director NAB/I.O. as PW.34. He
being an Investigating Officer, has collected the
service, and revenue record of appellant Rajab Ali.
His examination in chief would depict that he
received the revenue record from the revenue officials
of upper Kurram Agency, according to which, father
of appellant Rajab Ali, owned 106 Kanal and 01
Marlas land in three different Mozajat, who died in
the year 2006 and his property was transferred to his
LRs in the year 2012 through inheritance mutation,
wherein the share of appellant SHO came to 21
Kanals and 4 Marlas. The witness has also collected
the schools record of children of the appellant and his

other income and expenditure. This PW _ has
28

categorically admitted it correct that appellant and his
brothers are living jointly. He further admitted that
appellant Rajab Ali had been given out of turn
promotion in his service because of his bravery. In
reply to a question of defence, he replied that he had
investigated the matter relating to the alleged illegal
detention of innocent persons by appellant SHO, but
he could not trace any clue of involvement of the
appellant Rajab Ali in the alleged illegal detention of
innocent person. He stated that during investigation
co-appellant Latif Hussain provided him original sale
deed executed on stamp paper whereby he had
purchased various properties in the year 2011
excluding the deed in question. He has also obtained
original translation of certain letters which were in
Arabic Language relating to receipt of salaries by the
brothers of appellant Rajab Ali but have not placed
the same on record. He affirmed that_Haji Malik

Gulfam Hussain and Arif Hussain were the marginal

witnesses _of the disputed sale deed, who were

interrogated by him but did not record their

statements. He admitted that along with the disputed

stamp paper four other stamp papers were also

purchased by Latif Hussain on the same day and the

factum of its purchase was duly mentioned by the

stamp vendor in his register and each stamp paper was

given number; that on the disputed signatures of
Muhammad Youaf Karim the then Tehsildar two
persons (Experts) i.e. Nawab Ali Inspector and
Jehanzeb Inspector had given opinions. It is true that
he has not audited the inflow and outflow chart
Exh.PW.34/6 from chartered account and that he has
no experience in accountancy nor has worked with

any chartered account firm. During his cross-
29

examination on the request of defence, he produced
original agreement to sell bearing No.2553 and 2554
dated 05.09.2011, and 2552, 2553, and 2554 dated
05.09.2011, taken into possession by him from co-
appellant Latif Hussain.
14. It appears from the record that the total ill gotten
money assessed against the appellant Rajab Ali is
Rs.1,46,88,056/-. At the same time, it is apparent from the
revenue record, produced by the Prosecution Witnesses,
namely, Ashiq Ali Patwari and Political Tehsildars, that
appellant’s father, namely, Mir Ahmad Khan was ancestral
owner of 106 Kanals land in Kurram Agency in three
different Mozajat. It is admitted by Zahid Younas Political
Naib Tehsildar PW.28 that after demise of father of the
appellant Rajab Ali, his property devolved upon sons
including Rajab Ali (appellant) and his sisters, who
simultaneously, gifted their shares in favour of their
brothers through gift mutations referred above and
exhibited in prosecution evidence. The factum of joint
residence/dwelling of the appellant and his brothers has
been squarely proved by the prosecution itself in its
evidence through various PWs including the Investigating
Officer and Political Tehsildar. It is also proved from the
prosecution evidence that two brothers of the appellants are
serving in Saudia Arabia and getting handsome salaries to
the tune of 6000 Saudi Riyals. Plethora of revenue record
has been brought on record by the prosecution itself which
proves the ancestral property of the appellant in three
Mozajat of Kurram Agency. The inheritance mutation
No.334 of father of the appellant has been attested on
28.03.2012. Similarly, mutations No.677 dated 28.03.2012
Exh.PW.11/10 and mutation No.1542 attested on the same
date are the inheritance mutation of Mir Ahmad Khan in

Moza Masto Khel and Yousaf Khel of Kurram Agency in
30

favour of his LRs. Mir Afzal Moharrir office of the Saddar
Kanungo Kurram Agency (PW.11), has categorically
admitted that predecessor of Rajab Ali appellant were
recorded as land owners in the area since 1905 i.e. for the
last 110 years according to first settlement in Kurram
Agency. The net saving of the appellant has not been
assessed by the NAB authorities with honesty as sufficient
things have been left unattended in determination of
assessment i.e. the price of the straw heaps, the trees and
branches planted in the lands of the appellants, more
particularly, the income assessment of the orchards of
Pomegranates over an area of 05 Jareebs as admitted by
Patwari Halqa and Tehsildar, during the years under
assessment. Similarly, the saving of father of the appellant
till his death has also not been assessed. All the prosecution
witnesses have unanimously admitted the fact that appellant
and his brothers were dwelling together in their ancestral
house. A shred of evidence has not been bout on record by
the prosecution suggestive of the fact that after the death of
father of the appellant any brother amongst them has ever
shifted his abode in the vicinity or out of area. The Political
and Revenue Administration of Kurram Agency, have
admitted the factum of joint living of appellant and his
brothers. From prosecution evidence, it is manifest that
after the death of father of the appellant, the agricultural
property remained in his name till 2012, and during this
period remained under their joint cultivation. For the first
time inheritance mutation No.1542 dated 28.03.2012 was
attested in favour of LRs of Mir Ahmad Khan, and that too,
for the purpose of actualizing the sale transaction with co-
appellant. In the above scenario if the income of the
appellant Rajab Ali from his salaries since 1994 till 2012
and his due shares in the landed property along with joint

income of his brothers are taken into consideration, the
31

amount of Rs.,1,46,88,056/- being spent on purchase of the
disputed properties and construction thereon is justifiable,
even if the amount of the disputed sale of 80 Kanals land is
excluded from consideration, which transaction otherwise,
has been proved on the face of record from the prosecution
as well as defence evidence.

15. Coming to the case of co-appellant, Abdul Latif
and authenticity and genuineness of the agreement to sell
Exh.PW.30/1, suffice it to say that if one takes into
consideration the sole statement of statement of Noman Ali
Shah Political Tehsildar (PW.29), the same would be
sufficient to prove the disputed transaction. For the sake of
convenience and ready reference we would refer to a
question put to him by the defence and his answer:-

Q. Are you aware of the fact that being Tehsildar
Parachiner, Rajab Ali and his brothers had entered
a slae mutation in register of mutation in favour of
Latif Hussain co-accused which was _ not
signed/sanctioned by you?

A. “Attestation of mutation are of two kinds, 1. Zair-i-
Tajweez and 2. Ready for attestation. The mutation
from the side of Rajab Ali and his brothers in
favour of Latif Hussain was Zair-i-Tajweeb being
already entered and was not attested because of the
commencement of an inquiry against Rajab Ali”.

The statement of the aforesaid witness of the prosecution is
sufficient to prove the transaction of sale of 80 kanals
ancestral land of the appellant and his brothers in favour of
co-appellant Latif Hussain, who is not related to the
appellant Rajab Ali, because as per statement of Zahir
Hussain Political Moharrir (PW.20), appellant Rajab Ali
belongs to Bangash cast and co-appellant Latif Hussain to
Tori Mastokhel. According to statement of this witness the
casts of both the appellants are at daggers drawn due to
landed and other disputes. Keeping in view the allegations
against the appellant Rajab Ali and Latif Hussain that

former in order to justify the ill-gotten money manured the
32

sale transaction of 80 Kanals land with the latter coupled
with the above mentioned fact qua no existence of any
relationship and enmity between their casts, it does not
appeal to a prudent mind that both the appellants were in
league in the offence. The disputed transaction was an
agreement to sell only and that too prior to
inquiry/investigation of the NAB authorities in this case, as
it is evident from the statement of Political Tehsildar that
mutation qua the disputed transaction had been entered in
the revenue record and was “Zair-e-Tajweez” i.e. ready for
attestation, but could not be attested due to interference of
the NAB authorities in consequence of an inquiry. In such
eventuality, it is also not appealable to a prudent mind that
the appellant and his brothers having no relation with
co-appellant and both having different casts, and that too, as
daggers drawn would take a risk to deprive them from a
huge chunk of land measuring 80 Kanals by entering into a
fabricated transaction. It is also evident from the evidence
of the prosecution that on the day of execution of the
disputed deed Exh.PW.30/1 co-appellant Latif Hussain has
also entered into various other transactions with different
people of the locality. The sale deed in this regard taken by
the I.O. is sufficient proof of this fact. The I.O. while
conducting investigation has not recorded statements of
Muhammad Nazar and Gulfam Hussain, the marginal
witnesses of the disputed deed Exh.PW.30/1, purposely,
because their statements were favouring the stance of the
appellants. This act of the Investigation Officer is not only
the worst example of dishonesty on his part, but also
deplorable and against the norms of natural and criminal
administration of justice. It is to be noted that investigation
does not mean to collect evidence for the prosecution rather
the main aim and object of the investigation is the

collection of evidence from both the sides i.e. prosecution
33

and defence only for assistance of the court in dispensing
justice. Similarly, law cast heavy duty on the I.O. to deal
with the investigation fairly, justly without any fear and
favour to any party. The purpose of investigation is only to
dig out the real truth in light of the evidence to be collected
during investigation. Both the marginal witnesses Gulfam
Hussain and Muhammad Nazar, have appeared as DW.2
and DW.3 and have proved the factum of execution of the
dispute sale deed Exh.PW.301/1 in favour of co-appellant
Latif Hussain by appellant Rajab Ali and his brothers and
payment of rupees one coror at the time of execution of the
deed and pledge for the remaining outstanding amount later
on. An iota of evidence has not been brought on record by
the prosecution to prove that co-appellant Latif Hussain was
having no such sources to make a payment of rupees one
corore, rather sufficient evidence is available which proves
the strong financial status of co-appellant and the way of
payment in cash, therefore, there is no need to look for
money trail via bank etc.

16. So far as fakeness of the signature of Muhammad
Younas Karim Tehsildar over the disputed deed is
concerned, he has admitted in his statement the mode and
way in vogue in the Kurram Agency regarding sale and
purchase of the land. He, has not denied his signature over
the disputed deed rather his stance is that since the disputed
deed was without any verification report of his subordinate
staff, therefore, according to him the signature would not be
of him. To prove the signature of the said Tehsildar over the
disputed deed Muhammad Ashraf Malik has been produced
as DW.3. According to his report Exh.DW.3/2, he opined
the signature over the disputed sale deed to be that of
Muhammad Yousaf Karim Tehsildar. The remarks/view of
Nawab Ali Inspector FSL (PW.25), about the integrity,

honesty, intellectual level and expertise in the field of
34

graphology of Mr. Muhammad Asharaf Malik Inspector
(DW.3), are worth consideration, which runs as under:-

“There is no doubt with regard to the

expertise, authenticity, honesty of his trainer

namely, Ex-Director Malik Muhammad

Ashraf the then DIG Head of the Forensic

Science Laboratory because he is foreign

qualified Expert.
17. So in this view of the matter, PW.25 is the pupil of

DW.3 and he has testified about the credibility and honesty
of DW.3. In this view of the matter, the report/opinion
furnished by DW.3 would be more authentic to be relied
upon. Even otherwise, it has been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in case of “Amrood Khan Vs the State”
(2002 SCMR 1568), that expert opinion would not
outweigh ocular testimony. Evidence furnished by an
Expert is always treated to be a confirmatory nature qua
the ocular testimony and if the latter kind of the evidence
is trustworthy, confidence inspiring and consistent then the
Expert opinion will not outweigh. Similarly, in case of
“Saeed Ahmad Vs the State” (PLD 2003 Supreme
Court 389), the Hon’ble apex Court ruled that normally it
is not safe to treat Expert evidence as to handwriting
sufficient basis for conviction. Following the view of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court the worthy Quetta High Court in
case of “Ashfaq Khalid Vs the State” (PLD 2005
Quetta 01), observed that opinion of handwriting Expert is
not final word on the subject and it would be dangerous to
place implicit reliance on the opinion of Handwriting
Expert.

18. For what has been discussed above, prosecution
failed to produce the required evidence to prove the
alleged ill gotten money to be disproportionate to the

known source of income of the appellant Rajab Ali and the
35

alleged abetment and joining hands of co-appellant Latif
Hussain with him in the disputed sale transaction.
Accordingly, both the appeals are allowed, the conviction
and sentences of both the appellants recorded by the
learned Trial Court are set aside and they are acquitted of
the charge leveled against them. They be set at liberty
forthwith, if not detained in any other case.
