ABDUL LATIF KHAN, J:- Through this single
judgment, we intend to dispose of instant Criminal
Appeal filed by appellant/convict Farooq Ali and
connected Cr.A No.21-A/2014 titled, “Muhammad
Ashraf Vs The State” as both the appeals have been
filed against one and same judgment dated
15.2.2014, whereby the learned trial Court convicted
and sentenced the appellants Farooq Ali &
Muhammad Ashraf, involved in case FIR No.848
dated 29.9.2013 u/s 324/353/186 PPC/ 13 A.O/ 7
ATA, P.S. Mir Pur, District Abbottabad..

2. As per prosecution case, the local police

present on the spot signaled a motorcycle on which
two persons were riding, coming from Qalandar Abad
side who started firing at the police party with their
respective 30 bore pistols however the police party
escaped unhurt. The person sitting on rear seat of
motorcycle threw away a sack and both the accused
ran towards the Jungle. The local police took into
possession the motorcycle bearing registration
No.KDZ-7531 which was left by the accused. On
search of said sack a Rocket Launcher was
recovered. A helmet and mobile phone Nokia
containing SIM No.0311-2549907 left by the accused
were also taken into possession by the local police
through recovery memo in presence of marginal
witnesses. Consequently initially FIR was registered
against unknown accused.

3. Lateron during investigation, the house of
appellant/convict Farooq Ali was raided on the basis
of CDR data who was arrested with 30 bore pistol.
He disclosed the name of his other companion to be
Qari Saqib (absconding accused). During
interrogation he also disclosed about hiding of
explosive materials in the house of appellant

Muhammad Ashraf so the house of appellant
Muhammad Ashraf was also raided wherefrom huge
quantity of explosive material and arms &
ammunitions (fully mentioned in the recovery memo
Ex.PW.14/3) were recovered with the help of B.D.S,
personnel. Hence, appellant Muhammad Ashraf was
also arrested in the instant case.

4. After completion of investigation complete
challan against accused was submitted in the trial
Court where proceedings u/s 512 Cr.PC were
initiated against absconding accused Qari Saqib.
After farming of formal charge against the
appellants/convicts, the prosecution in order to prove
its case examined 15 PWs. At conclusion of trial, the
learned trial Court convicted the appellant/convict
Farooq Ali and sentenced as follows:

U/S 7(b) of Anti Terrorism Act 1997 r/w Sections
324/34 PPC to undergo imprisonment for 10 years
R.I alongwith a fine of Rs.100,000/- or in default
thereof to suffer further simple imprisonment for
Six months.

u/s 7(h) ATA, 1997 r/w 353/186/34 PPC to undergo
5 years R.I. alongwith fine of Rs.50,000/- or in

default thereof to suffer SI for two months,
u/s 7(i) ATA 1997 r/w 13 A.O, to undergo 5 years
R.I. alongwith fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default
thereof to suffer SI for two months. It was also
directed that all the sentences’ shall run
concurrently with extension of benefit of Section
382-B Cr.PC, in favour of accused.

5. Similarly vide same impugned judgment,
the learned trial Court also convicted the appellant
Muhammad Ashraf u/s 7(i) ATA 1997 r/w 13 A.O
and sentenced him to undergo 5 years R.I
alongwith a fine of Rs.50,000/- or in default
thereof to suffer SI for two months however he as
acquitted of the charges u/s 7(b), 7(h) ATA, 1997
riw Sections 353/186/324 PPC. Hence both the
appellants preferred separate appeals before this
Court for their acquittal.

Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of record reveals that two
persons coming on motorcycle were signaled to stop
by the police party present on the spot, but they
started firing at police party who escaped unhurt and
the accused after throwing a sack and leaving the

motorcycle, decamped from the spot by running
towards a Jungle. It is very strange to observe that no
such Jungle’ has been mentioned in the site plan by
the I.0, nor the police party tried to chase the
accused who were decamping from the spot on foot
leaving the motorcycle at the mercy of police party
which is not appealable to a prudent mind as to why
the police party consists of 5/5 police officials duly
armed did not chase two culprits running from the
spot on foot nor any firing was made by the local
police in self defence at the accused which creates
doubt in the prosecution case.

7. Admittedly none of the riders of the
motorcycles including appellant Farooq Ali, were
arrested on the spot nor the alleged recovery of sack
containing Rocket Launcher was recovered from
immediate possession of the appellant. The mobile
allegedly recovered from the spot is also not proved
to be ownership of appellant as SIM in the same was
not found registered in the name of appellant. The
CDR data collected by prosecution also does not
establish guilt of the appellant as no data of phone
call of appellant disclosing his name/identity has

been brought on record which could connect him with
the commission of offence. Though one Zafaryab
(PW.4) being neighbor of appellant Farooq Ali was
examined by the prosecution who deposed that he
contacted the appellant on the SIM number
recovered from the spot but he did not respond so he
sent SMS to him for obtaining his motorcycle. His this
assertion is misplaced as no data of SMS has been
collected by the 1.0, confirming his stance as to
whether any message has been sent by the said PW
to the appellant regarding obtaining motorcycle from
him or not. His stance was also belied from his
conduct as during his examination before Magistrate
as well as trial Court, he did not disclose his identity
to be police official rather it was defence counsel who
put question regarding his identity/profession who
replied that he is serving in police department which
shows malafide on his part and creating doubt in the
authenticity of his statement.

8. The motorcycle recovered from the spot
has also not been established to be the ownership of
appellant Farooq Ali as its registration documents are
not in the name of appellant nor it was recovered

from his immediate possession. Though one Adeel
(PW.3) was examined by the prosecution during trial
who disclosed that the said motorcycle was his
ownership which was sold by him to the appellant
Farooq Ali but he failed to produce any stamp
paper/deed, receipt or transfer letter in the name of
appellant, on which transaction of sale purchase of
motorcycle has been made, showing ownership of
the appellant so mere statement of said witness
without any cogent evidence is not sufficient to
establish link of the appellant with the motorcycle in
question.

9. So far as recovery of pistol 30 bore from
possession of appellant Farooq Ali is concerned, the
same is also of no help to the prosecution as no elder
of the locality or independent witness has been
associated by the police party at the time of raid on
the house of appellant. Even the lady constable has
not been associated by police party during raid on the
house of the appellant though other inmates of the
house including females were also residing in the
said house which is clear violation of provisions of
Section 103 Cr.PC. Besides, two empties recovered

from the spot and pistol 30 bore allegedly recovered
from appellant Farooq Ali were sent to the FSL for
comparison and according to FSL report both the
recovered empties were fired from the said pistol
which also creates doubt in prosecution case as
according to FIR, both the accused riding on
motorcycle started firing at the police party. So when
the recovered empties were fired by appellant then
where the empties fired by co-accused have gone
which were not recovered by local police from the
spot. The number of fire shots has also not been
mentioned by the prosecution witnesses as to how
many shots were fired by each accused, creating
doubt in the authenticity of mode and manner of the
occurrence described by the prosecution witnesses.

10. So far as appellant Muhammad Ashraf
is concerned, admittedly his ownership regarding
place/house from which allegedly huge quantity of
arms and ammunitions as well as explosive materials
were recovered is not proved by prosecution because
according to PW.3 Muhammad Riaz Patwari Halqa,
he has not visited the spot with the 1.0, for
demarcation of the place/house from which recovery

was effected rather he deposed that appellant is
owner to the extent of 3 Kanal 1 Marla 33 point in
Khasra No.679/2 out of which 15 Marlas consists of
house of appellant so it is not clear as to from whose
house the alleged recovery has been effected as
other houses are also situated in the said Khasra
number and PW.3 has not been associated by the
1.0, to the house of appellant for ascertaining the fact
as to whether the said recovery was effected from the
house of appellant or otherwise. It is also pertinent to
mention that the 1.0, has not been mentioned the
point of arrest of appellant in the site plan as to from
which place he was arrested though the points of
recovered articles have been mentioned but the site
plan is silent about place of arrest of the appellant as
well as presence of other inmates of the house which
creates doubt in the prosecution case. Besides, the
appellant is an aged person of 70 years (though
62/63 years mentioned in his statement u/s 342
Cr.PC) who is also a crippled person and cannot
move without wheel chair, also using clutches which
is duly admitted by the 1.0 (PW.14) in his cross
examination that the appellant is lamb and used

clutches. The recovery has also not been effected
from his immediate possession or at his instance and
pointation which creates doubt in the recovery
allegedly effected by local police from the house of
appellant.

11. No independent witness has _ been
associated by the local police during raid on the
houses of both the accused. Both the appellants
remained in police custody but none of them has
made confession before the competent Court. The
prosecution has also failed to bring on record any
evidence regarding previous’ involvement or
conviction of both the appellants in such like
activities. Mere charging the appellants without
strong and cogent evidence is not sufficient for
establish their guilt and conviction. The prosecution
case is full of loop holes and doubt the benefit of
which must go to the appellants. Many circumstances
are not sufficient for extending benefit of doubt to an
accused rather a single doubt is sufficient for
extending benefit to the accused though there are
many circumstances/doubt in the instant case so the
benefit of which must go to the appellant therefore,

the learned trial Court has not properly appreciated
the evidence produced by the prosecution while
convicting the appellants which needs to be
interfered by this Court.

12. In view of what has been observed
above, we allow the instant Criminal appeal (Cr.A
No.20-A/14) alongwith connected Cr.A No.21-
A/2014) and set aside the conviction and sentence
awarded to the appellants Farooq Ali (Farooq) and
Muhammad Ashraf by trial Court through impugned
judgment. Both the appellants are acquitted of the
charges levelled against them. They are in custody,
be released forthwith if not wanted in any other case.

Announced.
