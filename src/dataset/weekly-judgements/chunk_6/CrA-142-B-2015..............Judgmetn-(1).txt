SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Having faced trial in
Sessions Case No.42/Vii/2014, the respondent/accused
Fazal Manan was acquitted by learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Takht-e-Nausrati, Karak, vide judgment
dated 05.10.2015, in case FIR No.08 dated 23,03,2014,
registered under Section 302 PPC read with Section 15
Arms Act, at police station Khurram, District Karak.
2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR Ex. PA, registered on the basis of murasila Ex.-
PA/1, in brief, is that on 23.02.2014, Asif Hayat ASI
(PW-3) was on patrol duty when received information
about an incident, rushed to the spot i.c. house of Fazal
Manan situated in. Anar Banda where he found dead E

\ NER
Kamran Khan: son of Raham Din, where Fazal Manan

made report to the effect that he alongwith his daughter-
in-law Mst. Nazia Shaheen was residing in the said
house whereas his son Aurangzeb was serving in Pak
Arm; that on preceding night he and his daughter-in-law
were asleep in one room of their house, in the morning
(Azan Wela) at 0545, he got up and found his daughter-
in-law missing from her bed, he came out of the room
and heard murmuring from the second room, but the
door was locked from inside. Fie asked to open the door
but nobody did it, then he went to his room, look rifle
alongwith bandolies and asked again to open the door
which was not honoured, then he fired two fire shots
upon which the door was opened. When he entered the
room, he found his daughter-in-law Mst. Nazia Shaheen
with one Kamran‘Khan, his co-villager, in objectionable
condition upon which he got furious and fired at them,
resultantly, both were hit and fell down. On hearing the
fire shots, the co-villagers attracted to the spot to whom
he narrated the incident. He stated that subsequently he
came to know that both the injured had succumbed to

their injuries. He handed over his 7.62 bore 5 shots rifle

alongwith bandolier containing 15 rounds -of 7.62 to

PW-3. Hence, the FIR.
3. After, completion of the investigation by
Mir Shah Jehan SI (PW-4), complete challan was

submitted before the trial Court, Accused was charged

-3-

for the offence to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution
examined as many as eight witnesses, whereafter, the
accused was examined under Section 342, Cr.P.C,
wherein, he - denied the allegations and professed
innocence, however, he neither opted to be examined on
oath, nor produced evidence in his defence. The learned
trial Court, after hearing arguments from both the sides,
acquitted the accused/respondent vide impugned
Judgment dated 05.10.2015, hence the instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Deceased Kamran aged 21/22 years and.
Mst. Nazia Shaheen aged about 28/29 years lost their
lives in the house of respondent Fazal Manan after
receiving fire arm injuries. The matter was allegedly
reported by Fazal Manan the respondent to PW-3, who
on information attracted to the spot house. The
accused/respondent was arrested and the weapon of
offence was shown recovered from his possession
alongwith 15 live:rounds.

6. To begin with, the deceased Mst. Nazia
Shaheen was daughter-in-law of the respondent, whose
husband Auranzeb Khan was serving in Pak Army,

while she was stated to be living with

accused/respondent in his house. anlar ‘
=4-

7. The prosecution story shown unfolded by
the respondent was that on 23.2.2014, the respondent
woke up and found the deceased Mst. Nazia Shaheen
“missing from her bed, to satisfy his curiosity, he came
out and heard murmuring from a room with its door
closed from inside; that he called to open but his demand
was not honoured; so he picked up the rifle and fired on
the door, at last, the door was ‘unfastened from inside, it
is in the report that the respondent went in and found the
two in compromising position and killed the two by
firing. The report further unfolds that the story was
narrated to the local elders who informed the police.

8. The incident occurred inside the house of
the respondent, with the two as the sole inmates, i.c. the
deceased and respondent, on the day.

We are to judge as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode and manner and as to whether the
report was made by the respondent and that as to
whether it was the respondent who killed?

The report tells that the incident occurred
in the room with its door closed initially and that it was
after fire shot on the door that the deceased unchained.
As in criminal cases the behavior of both, the murderer

and murdered are the determining factors coupled with

the circumstances that prevail at the time and, so is the ps a

case. The report tells, that on initial call the door was not
-5-

opened and that it was the shot on the door which led the
deceased to open: We are yet to resolve that when the
deceased were confirmed that the caller was armed and
that there was eminent threat to their lives, then why they
unlocked the door, as to keep the door shut they had
better chances to survive. If we move with what the
report said, then’a question will stand in the way that
who out of the two unfastened the door and that how the
deceased kept sitting on sofa and Mst, Nazia Shaheen
went back and that how she was hit from the back as by
then she was supposed to face the accused with the hope
to struggle out and such should have been the position of
deceased Kamran: Blood was recovered from two places
ie. the mattress on the ground where the deceased
Mst. Nazia Shaheen fell after receiving fire shots and
from the sofa “lying “near the door having been
photographed where the deceased Kamran was shown
sitting. The prosecution was to answer that how the
deceased Kamran was hit from back when just behind
was the wall and that how his back was exposed when
the lady was the first target but the prosecution is yet to
answer, The report says that when the door was relaxed
from inside the accused entered but no point has been

given at the footnote of the site plan, however, in the

drawing one point has becn introduced as 1-C, so weft % eye

presume it the point the accused occupied when. he oh .

entered the room and fired at the deceased. All the three
ie. the accused: deceased Kamran and Mst. Nazia
Shaheen were two feet away from one another, if
deceased Nazia Shaheen was the first target in that
eventuality the deceased Kamran had the chance to
overpower or to run away, as the accused/respondent
was facing the lady/deceased or if the deceased Kamran
was the first target, then deceased Nazia Shaheen could
avail the same opportunity but they did not despite the
fact that by the time the respondent was 67/68 years of
age, what a happy. surrender this was to the accused to
write their fate. We tried to voice yes with what the
prosecution canvassed at the bar but we failed to concur
the judicial wisdom in accepting the manner and the way
the tragedy was enacted. We have two deceased i.e.
Kamran and Mst. ‘Nazia Shaheen with 5 and 4 injuries
respectively, but the rifle used could accommodate five
rounds at a time and that it has never been the case that it
was reloaded after once it exhausted and yet again if this
was not reloaded, then how seven empties and a missed
cartridge were recovered from the spot.

9. The incident was stated to have occurred at
5:45 a.m, whereas,the police was informed at 10:00 a.m,
who reached in 30 minutes and it was 10:30 a.m. that-the
TED
matter was reported. and it was scribed by Asif Hayat At t

: aR.
ASI, who was later on examined as PW-3. PW-3, when esas Gat coer
arate) bere?
appeared before the Court, stated that he was informed

by one Fareed, who was the Nazim, but admitted that his

name was not mentioned in the report, he further stated

that he disclosed the name of the informer to the

Investigating Officer but his this stance was denied

when the Investigating Officer was examined as PW-4
who stated that he was not told by the scribe that it was
one Fareed, who? ” conveyed the information. PW Asif
Hayat stated that the Investigating Officer reached
within 25/30 minites after he reached to the spot, but the
Investigating Officer stated that he went to the place of
occurrence at 1:30 p.m, this conflict between the two
teads this Court whol that PW-4 never visited the spot,
rather the investigation was conducted and the site plan
was prepared ‘by Pw. 3.

10. The t ‘time of occurrence has been given as
5:45 a.m, whereas the matter was s reported as 10:30 a.m,
and this abnormal delay in reporting the matter tells
nothing but of an ‘attempt on part of the police to charge
the innocent and to favour the responsible and that was
the reason that 161 Cr.P.C. statement of Tikka Khan,
brother of the deceased Kamran, was recorded on
26.02.2014, showing their lack of interest to charge the
respondent initially. -The scribe shown recovered the
rifle from personal possession of the accused/respondent

and stated that at the time of making report the

-8-

accused/respondént “was holding the rifle, we are
surprised to see iis abnormality that why for long five
hours the aceused was holding the rifle till it was handed
over. The police official displayed dubious conduct as
all the recovery ‘hemos except weapon of offence were
witnessed by one Fareed, a Nazim, and when PW-3 was
asked that why Fareed was not cited as witness thereto,
he stated that the private people were not ready to
witness the recovery, but we cannot accede to the
statement so tendered, as the report was allegedly made
by the accuseditespondent and produced the weapon of
offence, then there was no threats to the people of the
locality if were cited as witnesses, as it was a happy .. .
surrender. The non-association of private witnesses with
the process of recovery of the rifle tells nothing but that
the weapon was later on planted to make the case a
success. The delayed report doubt the veracity of the
witnesses which gets support from the statement of the
scribe, who stated that when he reached to the crime
house, private péople were present, if so, then why none
from the public Werified the report, especially one Sajjad
Khan and Armsaz, whose 161 Cr.P.C statements were
recorded and there was no danger of earning enmity, as

it was the respondent who reported. The appellant

“Tt
alongwith his son Tikka Khan were present at the tim

of arrest and recovery, but they did not charge the pe aon? ar Mi
ana
-9-)

respondent for contimission of the offence, but it was on
26.2.2014, when the police prevailed and they charged
the respondent. The Investigating Officer stated that he
produced the accused before the Court of Judicial
Magistrate on 24.2.2014, where he refused to confess,
we are anxious to know that what derailed the accused to
disown the report on the very next day, when per
prosecution it was he, who reported.
U1. The “bed rock on which the prosecution
erected its structure, was the teport allegedly made by
the respondent and the weapon recovered, this Court is
faced with a dilemma either to believe the disowned
report or the circumstances that had gripped the story. If
we accept the resiled story of the accused/respondent as
correct that it was the respondent who killed the
deceased with the recovered weapon, then the FSL
report blocks the way, which tells that the empties were
fired from different weapons. The doctor who conducted
autopsy on the dead bodics stated that the injuries found
had. different dimensions and in the case of deceased
Kamran it “was” mentioned, that he received fire shots
from different directions. The circumstances belie what
the accused/resporident reported and it tells nothing but
that more than one accused were involved in the episode

constrained to ‘hold that “Men may tell lies but
circumstances do not”,

12. : The, prosecution case hinges upon the
report allegedly inade by the respondent but no further
evidence was either collected or produced to substantiate
the stance of the appellant to hold the respondent as
accused and convicted. The respondent while allegedly
making the report stated that he narrated the incident to
the local elders attracted to the spot after the incident,
who informed thé police but this is astonishing that why
the dead bodies remained on the spot for long five hours
and that why the elders did not inform the police soon
after they reached, The persons who reached to the spot
soon after the occurrence were including one Sajjad
Khan and Aramsaz Khan and these were the witnesses
who could tell as to whether it was the respondent who
reported the matter or otherwise. The Investigating
Officer recorded’ their statements under Section 161,
Cr.P.C. and eyen their. names were placed in the
calendar of witnesses, but were not produced during
trial, rather we heard no whisper in that respect and
when so, what elge could corroborate the story, hence, in
this eventuality: the report.loses its worth and even
otherwise, non-production of these witnesses suggests
that had they been produced they would not have

supported the prosecution case and benefit can be sought

from Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. ;

In éase titled Zahir Khan Vs, The State

Goll SCMR 646), it was held by Hon’ble Supreme
Court that:-

“13. In the present case as observed

above, the clouds over the veracity of

the prosecution version began hovering

with the substitution of the initially
nominated persons in the F.ILR. and

also that complainant did not appear as

a witness. It assumes relevance as he

(Ghulam Hussain), Sultan Mehmood

and Ghulam Abbas were given up by the
prosecution and not produced. The only

possible conclusion is that the
prosecution sensed the risk of producing a
them thdt they might not support the
said version. Their production thus was
withheld leaving doubts spreading all
around” °

13. The. prosecution wanted to harvest the
benefits of the report made by the respondent, but the
same did not. find support from anywhere and nothing
was brought on record to substantiate its worth, so much
so even the respondent did not accept its authenticity, as
on the very next day the respondent refused to confess
when he was brought before the Court of Judicial
Magistrate. The accused was examined under Section
342, CrP.C., where to a question that, “What is your
Statement and why are you charged’, he replied that he
was innocent and falsely implicated with the sole
purpose to shelter the real culprits. The report so made at Tt Ss

loses significance‘when its maker resiles. eX* SUS ER a

In case titled Rahmatullah Vs. The State

(2018 P.Cr.L.J. Note 31 [Peshawar D.I.Khan Bench}),
it was held that: "

“First of all, we would take the FIR and
its probative value. As the record
stands, the FIR was recorded on the
basis of report made by the appellant
himself’. There is no cavil with the
proposition that the FIR itself is not a
substantive piece of evidence unless its
contents’ are affirmed on oath and
subjected to the test of cross
examination. Legally, it is a previous
statement which can be used for the
purpose. of contradicting and
corroborating its maker and unless it is
not proved in accordance with law, it is
no evidence and therefore, cannot be
taken as a proof of anything stated a
therein. But when it is based on a
statement made by an accused before
the police which tends to incriminate
him with reference to the offence he is
charged with, in that event, it being
inadmissible in evidence is not even
worth the paper it is written on, hence
has to be left entirely out of account. In
the instant case, admittedly neither the
maker of FIR appeared in its support
nor stood the test of cross-examination.
In such circumstances, the report in the
instant case is ruled out of
consideration”.

14. On ‘acquittal, an accused person earns
twofold innocencé particularly, in the case is the bedrock
principle of justice. In a case of acquittal, the standard
and principle of, appreciation of evidence is entirely
different from that in a case of conviction. Unless the

findings of the tial Court are found perverse, fanciful,

High Court would not lightly disturb the same because
on reappraisal, another view might be possible therefore,
sanctity is attached under the law to such findings. in
ordinary course. “We ‘do not find any element of the
nature discussed above, in the findings rendered by the
learned trial Court, therefore, the acquittal of the
respondenvaccused is not liable to be reversed.
Resultantly, we see no illegality or irregularity in the
impugned judgment which could attract this Court lo
reverse the same. Hence, this appeal being without merit
and substance is hereby dismissed.
