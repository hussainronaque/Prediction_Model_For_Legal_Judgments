WIOAR AHMAD, J.- My this order is directed to
dispose of appeal filed by the convict/appellant namely
Muhammad Hanif against his conviction
and sentence awarded to him vide judgment
dated 24.09.2018 of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Kohat in the criminal case registered vide
FIR No. 88 dated 20.03.2017 under sections 324/
337-F(iii) PPC at Police Station Gumbat, District

Kohat.

2. Report of the occurrence was lodged by
the complainant namely Mst. Bismillah Jan daughter of
Kabir Khan in the emergency room of Rural Health
Center (hereinafter referred to as ‘RHC’), Gumbat
stating therein that she along with her daughter namely

Tania Bibi had been going to the house of her mother-

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
&

y

in-law for the purpose of extending her, an invitation
for the marriage of her son namely Sakhawat Ali, on
the day of occurrence. When they reached near Basic
Health Unit, Parshai (hereinafter referred to as
‘BHU’), at 08:45 AM her ex-husband namely
Muhammad Hanif (appellant/convict) appeared, took .
out his pistol and started firing at her with the intention
of committing her murder, The complainant got injured
as a result of the firing. She stated that motive for the
occurrence was the impending marriage of her son
Sakhawat Ali which had been taking place against the
wishes of the convict/appellant. The occurrence was
also witnessed by daughter of the complainant and the

convict namely Tania Bibi.

3. Investigation in the case proceeded.
Beside other formalities, blood stained clothes of the
complainant were recovered and sealed vide recovery
memo Ex PC. Blood soaked earth and three empties of
30 bore pistol were also recovered vide recovery memo
Ex PC/1. The report of medical examination of the
complainant was brought on record as Ex PM. The
accused was arrested on 23.04.2017. He was shown to
have made pointation of the place of occurrence, and
on his pointation, 30 bore pistol was also recovered,

whereafter section 15-A.A was added to the case of

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
3

prosecution. On completion of investigation in the
case, complete chalian was put in Court on 08.06.2017.
Charge was framed and prosecution was allowed to
produce its evidence, whereafter they produced eight
(08) witnesses and closed their evidence. Statement of
accused was recorded under section 342 Cr. PC. He
however did not opt for giving statement on oath. The
learned trial Court at the conclusion of the trial,
convicted the accused/appellant for the commission of

offence and sentenced him as follows;

“Under section 324 PPC to ten (10
years rigorous imprisonment with fine
of Rs. 50,000/- (rupees fifty thousand)
or in default thereof to suffer six (06)
months S.I.

Under section 337-F(iii) PPC to three
(03) years rigorous imprisonment with
fine of Rs. 50,000/- (rupees fifty
thousand) as daman to be paid to the
injured/complainant as compensation
Sor the expenses borne by her on her
treatment or in case of default in
payment of daman, he will be dealt
with in a manner prescribed by section
337-Y(ii) PPC.

Both the sentences shall run
concurrently with extension of benefit
of section 382-B Cr. PC to the
convict/appellant.”

4. Learned counsel for the convict/appellant
contended during the course of his arguments that Mst.
Bismillah Jan (complainant) stated in her statement
recorded in the Court that her statement was recorded
by the police after two days of the occurrence and that

Mst. Tania Bibi (eye-witness PW-8) had stated that her

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
Se

4

statement had been recorded immediately after
statement of the complainant, therefore the statement
of the witness i.e. Mst. Tania Bibi was recorded under
section 161 Cr. PC at a delay of two days and her
statement for the said reason could not be relied upon.
He further added that the occurrence had taken place
near BHU but the injured/complainant had straight
away been taken to RHC, which fact has made the
place of occurrence doubtful. He further added that the
distance from which the complainant had been fired
upon does not seem to be real. Had it been so, then the
bullet would have passed the body of the complainant
through and through. He has raised particular objection
regarding non-sending of empties earlier and keeping it
in the police station till recovery of the weapon of
offence. He added that no reliance can be placed upon

such a recovery.

5. Learned counsel for the complainant
submitted in rebuttal that a BHU does not have the
facility of treating persons with bullet injuries and
that’s why the complainant has been taken straight to
the RHC, which was a relatively larger hospital with
better facilities. He further added that the prosecution
has been able to prove the case through the testimony

of both the eye-witnesses, who have remained

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
5
consistent in their stance throughout. He further added

that the complainant had no reason for substituting the
sole accused/appellant nor any other enmity could be
shown to have been existing, providing a cause for any
other person to have made firing upon the complainant.
The prosecution in such circumstances, according to
learned counsel for the complainant, had fully proved
the case beyond reasonable doubt. Regarding the
quantum of sentence, the learned counsel stated that
the convict had repeated the firing which fully
established his intention of killing the lady and that the
learned trial Court had rightly awarded him the full

dose of 10 years.

6. The learned Addl:A.G adopted the

arguments of private counsel for the complainant.

7. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties, the learned Addl:A.G appearing on

behalf of the State and perused the record.

8. Perusal of record reveals that two eye-
witnesses of the occurrence were produced by the
prosecution. One was the injured/complainant herself
while another was her daughter namely Mst. Tania
Bibi, who also happened to be the real daughter of the
appellant. Complainant was examined as PW-7, who

has narrated her account, as given in the FIR, in her

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
6

examination-in-chief. She had been cross examined by
learned counsel for the appellant but nothing
prejudicial to the case of prosecution could be brought
out from her mouth, except a sentence in her statement,
wherein she had stated that after lodging of FIR, the
local police had recorded her statement after 2/3 days
of the occurrence in the KDA hospital. The daughter of
the complainant/injured namely Mst. Tania Bibi was
examined as PW-8, who has also fully supported the
case of the complainant during her examination-in-
chief. She had not only stood the test of cross
examination but has remained consistent with the
statement of other eye-witness i.e. PW-7. Learned
counsel for the appellant has particularly raised
objection regarding her part of statement given in cross
examination, where she had stated that her statement
had been recorded by the police after recording the
statement of her mother (PW-7). The learned counsel
tried to build an argument that since the mother had
stated in her cross-examination that her statement had
been recorded by the police after 2/3 days of the
occurrence in KDA hospital, therefore, statement of
the eye-witnesses should also be taken to have been
recorded under section 161 Cr. PC after 2/3 days of the
occurrence. While developing such an argument, the

learned counsel, I am afraid, was not having a holistic

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
8)

7
picture of the whole statements of both the eye-

witnesses. The relevant part of the statement of Mst.
Tania Bibi (PW-8), is reproduced hereunder for ready

reference;

“After receiving injuries we shifted my
mother to RHC Gumbat and thereafter to
KDA hospital Kohat by both of us. My
mother reported the matter at RHC Gumbat.
Our other relatives also visited my mother at
KDA hospital Kohat. My uncle Shabbir and
brother also reached KDA hospital. When
we reached KDA hospital, my uncle Shabbir
and brother were already present there. My
statement was recorded by the police after
recording my mother statement. My 161
statement was recorded on the day of
occurrence. I do not remember the exact
time of recording my 161 statement. I spent
one day with my mother in the hospital.”

It is quite clear that this lady was referring
to the lodging of report by the complainant in RHC,
Gumbat, the moment she reached there. She
accordingly stated that her statement was recorded
after recording the statement of her mother. Lodging of
the report to the police at RHC, Gumbat on the
relevant time had not otherwise been disputed by the
appellant. Same stand proved from the statements of
PW-3 and PW-6 as well as statements of the eye-
witnesses, particularly the part reproduced above. Both
the eye-witnesses have remained consistent in this
regard. So far as the statement of complainant that her

statement was recorded by the police after 2/3 days of

the occurrence in KDA hospital, is concerned; it is

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
8

important to be noted that the said sentence opens with
the word “after lodging of FIR”. FIR had been lodged
on her report. May be that the investigating officer had
discussed certain aspects of the case in the hospital
after 2/3 days of the occurrence but no other statement
of the complainant had ever been recorded after
lodging of her first report. The said statement cannot
therefore be construed that her statement had actually
been recorded after 2/3 days and that statement of
other eye-witness was recorded thereafter. The
objection of learned counsel is therefore found to be

misplaced.

9. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan
had held in a number of judgments that the worth of
the injured eye-witness cannot be lightly disbelieved, if
it remains consistent with the other particulars of the
case and evidence produced. Reiterating the said ratio,
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment

rendered in the case of Farooq Khan ys The State

reported as 2008 SCMR 917, has observed as follows;

“9, As to the argument of learned counsel
Sor the appellant that the solitary statement
of injured P.W.8 was the basis of conviction,
suffice it to observe that the injured
prosecution witness had given the number
of injuries caused to the deceased in the
incident by attributing the responsibility to
the appellant. Evidence of this witness has
been c supported by medical evidence
furnished by Dr. Muhammad Magsood

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
ro

9

P.W.6 who conducted post-mortem
examination on the dead body of the
deceased Zahir Khan. The evidence of
injured witness is worthy of credence,
independent and natural and there was no
lawful justifiable cause to discard his
evidence. The credence of statement of
solitary witness has already been examined
by this Court in a number of cases. In this
context reference can be made to Mali v.
The State 1969 SCMR 76; Muhammad
Ashraf v. The State 1971 SCMR 530,
Muhammad Siddique alias Ashraf alias
Achhi and 3 others v. The State 1971 SCMR
659 and Muhammad Mansha vy. The State
2001 SCMR 199. Moreover, conviction in
any murder case can be based on the
testimony of a single witness, if the Court is

- satisfied that the witness is reliable. In other
words, the "emphasis" is on quality of
evidence, and not on its quantity. In this
behalf reliance can be placed on the case of
Allah Bakhsh v. Shammi PLD 1980 S C
225,”

10. The lady Doctor has been examined as
PW-3, who has given detail of the injuries on the
person of the complainant. In cross examination, she
stated that the medico-legal report Ex PM had also
been partially written by Dr. Arshad Sohail in blue ink.
She admitted that the said report has not been signed
by the said Dr. Arshad Sohail. She had repeated in her
cross examination that as per observations, there were
three firearm entry wounds on the body of injured,
while one was exit wound on the back of the body of
the injured. Perusal of report Ex PM reveals that the
general entries regarding name, address, time etc had
been entered with blue ink by Dr. Arshad Sohail while

the description of injuries had entirely been given by

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
oe

10
the lady Doctor Syed Gul Bhar, who has been

examined as PW-3. It is obvious that since the
complainant was a lady, therefore the lady Doctor had
examined her and she has so stated in her examination-
in-chief as well as in cross examination. Dr. Arshad
Sohail may have helped in preparing the report but so
far as the description of the injuries is concerned, same
has been examined and scribed by the lady Doctor
(PW-3) in black ink. Therefore, non-examination of
Dr. Arshad Sohail would not reflect adversely on the

case of prosecution.

11, Learned counsel for the convict/appellant
also contended that the occurrence was stated to have
taken place near BHU but the complainant has straight
away been taken to another Health Unit commonly
known as RHC, Gumbat which makes the place of
occurrence doubtful. This fact has been clarified by the
complainant in her cross examination, wherein she
stated that she had not visited BHU, Parshai as there
had been no facility there. She had further stated that
they reached Gumbat hospital in 20 to 25 minutes. It is
common knowledge that Basic Health Unit does not
possesses Operation Theaters for surgical procedures
and does not entertain patients with bullet injuries. The

decision to shift the complainant to RHC was for

"I narrated to the Investigating
Officer that parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to him by
Investigating Officer confronted with
Exh.D.C. where it is not so
recorded."

It was also admitted by him in cross-
examination that he did not state before the
Investigating Officer in his statement
Exh.D.C. that the parcel containing crime
empty was handed over to Khadim Hussain
P.W.4, He also admitted that he did not send
crime empty to expert till 1-12-1999,
Khadim Hussain P.W.4_ stated in
examination-in-chief that he received parcel
containing empty bullet on 3-11-1999 from
Muhammad Akhtar P.W.14. He handed
over to Muhammad Ramzan for onward
transmission in the office of Forensic
Science Laboratory. P.W.16 Khalid Rauf
arrested appellant on 5-12-1999. He also got
recovered the pistol from him on his
pointation. Thereafter he had handed over
pistol to P.W.4 Khadim Hussain. This type
of recovery of crime empty does not provide
strong corroboration qua the prosecution
version.”

It has also been held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment given in the

case of Nizamuddin vs The State reported as 2010

SCMR 1752 that the delay in sending of the crime
weapon and crime empties shall not overweigh the
ocular evidence. The relevant part of the observation is

reproduced hereunder for ready reference;

“6. Coming to the question of delay in
sending crime weapon and crime empties,
admittedly, the crime empties were
recovered on the day of incident and the
crime weapon was recovered on 17-7-1996,
It appears that the same were, however, sent
to Chemical Examiner on 24-7-1996 with
considerable delay but such delay shall not,
in the facts and circumstances of this case,
overweigh the ocular evidence found in line

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
13

with and supported by the medical
evidence.”

Similar view has also been expressed by
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment
rendered in the case of Nizamuddin vs The State
reported as 2010 SCMR 1752, The recovery of weapon
of offence and its matching report with the empties
cannot therefore by relied upon, but it has equally been
held by the Hon’ble Apex Court in its judgment
rendered in the ibid case of Ranjha vs The State, that
when the prosecution succeeds in proving the case
through direct testimony, then the corroborative piece
of evidence like non-recovery of weapon of offence

lose its significance.

13. In the case in hand, since the prosecution
has been able to prove its case through direct evidence,
where not only the complainant but the real daughter
of the convict/appellant had testified against him and
both of them have remained consistent on material
particulars of the case. Motive for the occurrence has
not only been established by the prosecution through
the statements of two eye-witnesses but has been
admitted by the appellant in answers to questions
No. 13 & 14 of statement recorded under section
342 Cr. PC. In such circumstance, the prosecution has

been able to prove the case against the appellant

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
14

beyond any reasonable doubt and he has therefore

rightly been convicted by the learned trial Court.

14, So far as the sentence awarded to the
appellant is concerned; it is apparent that the maximum
sentence provided for an offence under section 324
PPC is 10 years. The complainant has been fortunate
that all her vital organs had escaped the brunt of the
bullets fired by the convict/appellant. The existence of
the motive also suggests that the appellant may have
been prodded by some problems created by his ex-wife
which were related to his son and daughter, both being
supposed to be nearer to his heart despite separation
between the spouses. In such circumstances, the
convict/appellant did not deserve a full dose. A
sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment under
section 324 PPC is found reasonable in the

circumstances of the case.

15. Though the appellant has neither agitated
in the memo of appeal nor at the bar that he
had been convicted by the learned trial Court under
section 337-F(iii) PPC for undergoing a sentence of
three (03) years RI and Rs. 50,000/- as Daman,
without being specifically charge sheeted for an
offence under the said section of law, yet the said
fact was found readily noticeable on the face

of record. Charge had only been framed under

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
¢

IN

15

section 324 PPC and the allegation of the commission
of offence under section 337-F(iii) PPC had not been
specifically stated in the charge. This aspect of the case
requires determination despite the fact that it had not
been agitated by the appellant as a ground of appeal.
Such like questions have come up before the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan time and again and stand

well settled. In the case of Muhammad Aslam vs The

State reported as 1970 P Cr. LJ 987, the Hon’ble

Supreme Court of Pakistan was dealing with the case
of the appellant who had been convicted under section
302 PPC as well as under section 307 PPC (now 324
PPC). One of the questions before the Hon’ble Court
was that charge had not been framed against the
accused under section 307 PPC (now 324 PPC) by the
learned trial Court. The Hon’ble Apex Court resolved

the said question in the following manner;

“The next contention of Dr. Tassadduque
Hussain was that the learned Judges erred
in convicting Raja under section 307 of the
Pakistan Penal Code as no charge under
that section was framed against him. It is
true that no specific charge under section
307 was framed against Raja; but it appears
that he was clearly accused of having made
an attempt to commit the murder of Mehdi
Khan by pistol shot. The prosecution
evidence was led to that effect. It appears
that Raja was asked both in the committing
Court and the trial Court if he had fired a
pistol shot at Mehdi Khan as he shouted out
because of Aslam's firing at Nur Dad. Raja,
of course, answered this question in the
negative in both the Courts, but he was

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
€

16

clearly aware of the definite accusation
levelled against him personally. The trial
Court's judgment shows that the trial was
held for several offences including the
offences of murder and an attempt to
commit murder under sections 302 and 307,
respectively. The appeal preferred on behalf
of the State was one against r the trial
Court's order acquitting Raja of an offence
under section 307 of the Pakistan Penal
Code. Lastly, Raja himself made a petition
for special leave to appeal against his
conviction and sentence under section 307.
Thus, Raja was all along award that he was
tried for an offence under section 307 of the
Pakistan Penal Code, although no charge
under that section was expressly framed
against him, This was nothing but an
omission of a formal charge under section
307 of the Pakistan Penal Code in respect of
Raja. As he was already aware of the exact
nature of the accusation against him, no
prejudice was caused to him by the omission
of a charge under section 307 against him.
In view of the provisions of section 535 and
clause (b) of section 537 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, as introduced by the
Code of Criminal Procedure (West Pakistan
Amendment) Act, 1964, the omission to
frame a formal charge under section 307
against Raja is of no consequence, and his
conviction and sentence under that section
cannot be called in question only on the
ground of that omission, As Raja was found
to have fired a pistol shot at Mehdi Khan in
an attempt to kill him, his appeal against his
conviction and sentence under section 307
of the Pakistan Penal Code is liable to be
dismissed.”

In the said case, conviction under section
307 PPC (now 324 PPC) was maintained, despite the
fact that charge had not been specifically framed under

the said section of law.

16. In the case of Zafar Iqbal vs The State
reported as PLD 2015 Supreme Court 307, the convict

had been sentenced under section 7 (a) of the Anti-

Abdul Saboch/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad
17

Terrorism Act, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the
Act’). The Hon’ble Apex Court found that section 7 (a)
of the Act was not attracted to the case of the appellant
and that he should have been sentenced under section
302 PPC only. The Hon’ble Apex Court altered the
sentence accordingly without remanding the case back
to the trial Court. While disposing of the said case, the
Hon’ble Apex Court recorded the following

observations;

“16. The appellant knew what he was
being charged for and was also charged
under both the said provisions of law. The
learned judge, however, committed an error
in dropping the charge under section 302,
P.P.C. at the time of pronouncement of
- judgment and in convicting the appellant
under section 7(a) of the Act as at the
relevant time the Act had not been
promulgated. Section 38 specifically
provides for punishment, "as authorized by
law at the time the offence was committed",
which would mean that the appellant could
only be punished under section 302, P.P.C.
The question that requires consideration is
whether as a consequence of the said error
the trial was vitiated or was materially
AeSECHVE....crccoveecoecsecscceres Cenc eveneeeseeseees

17. That a sentence can be reversed and
altered provided it has occasioned a failure
of justice. If the appellant was convicted
under section 302(6), P.P.C. it would have
left him with a window of opportunity to
effect a compromise with the heirs of a
deceased, therefore to such extent his
conviction under section 7(a) of the Act
could be categorized as a failure of justice.
Moreover, though not applicable in the
present case, a conviction under the Act
excludes the earning of remission (section
21F of the Act). Consequently, exercising
our powers under section 537 of the Code
we alter the conviction of the appellant from
section 7(a) to one under section 302(b),

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wiqar Ahmad

Fy
18

P.P.C. as ta'tir, whilst maintaining the
compensation of one hundred thousand
rupees payable to the heirs of each deceased
under section 544-A of the Code and in
default thereof to undergo simple
imprisonment of six months. With this
alteration in sentence the appeal is
dismissed.”

Similar view was also expressed by a five
member Bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court in its
judgment rendered in the case of Talal_Ahmed
Chaudhry vs The State reported as 2019 SCMR 542,

wherein the Hon’ble Court held;

“Further, it has been settled by this Court in
a number of cases, that since there is no
yardstick available to fix the essential
factors which a charge must contain,
therefore, an omission or defect in charge
which does not mislead or prejudice the -
right of the accused could not be regarded
as material and made the basis to vitiate a
trial on the ground of error or omission in
framing charge, it does not even make a
case of remand. Reference can readily be
made to the case of Nadir Shak v. The State
(1980 SCMR 402), S.A.K. Rehmani vy. The
State (2005 SCMR 364), M. Younus Habib
v. The State (PLD 2006 SC 153) and Malik
Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri v. The State
(PLD 2016 SC 17). The argument,
therefore, fails.”

17. The appellant in the case in hand knew
very well that he had been put to trial, after his
indictment, for an attempt to commit qatl-i-amd of the
complainant Mst. Bismillah Jan by firing at her
effectively and thereby committing an offence under
section 324 PPC. It also stood embedded in later part

of section 324 PPC that a person committing an

Abdul Sabooh/* {S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Wigar Ahmad
yD

19

offence there-under shall also be liable to punishment.
provided for causing hurt to any person. The appellant
had therefore not been materially prejudiced in his
defence and the irregularity is therefore curable under
section 535 read with 537 of the Criminal Procedure

Code, 1898.

18, In light of what has been discussed above,
the appeal of the appellant against his conviction is
dismissed, while it is partially allowed to the extent of
reducing his sentence awarded under section 324 PPC
from ten (10) years R.I to seven (07) years R.I. Rest of
the sentences are also kept intact but all the sentences
shall be running concurrently. Benefit of section 382-B

Cr. PC is also extended to the appellant.
