SYED MUHAMMAD __ATTIQUE SHAH, _J.-

Accused-petitioner, Rawail, after having been refused
bail by the learned lower Courts in case FIR No.218
dated 05.07.2017 under sections 324/337-F(iii) PPC,
registered at Police Station Mangal, District
Abbottabad, has approached this Court for the same
relief by filing the instant bail petition.

2. The allegation against the accused-
petitioner, as reveals from the report of Nazakat Ali,
complainant is that his brother Rafaqat Ali visited the
house of father-in-law of accused/petitioner Ruwail,
brother-in-law of complainant in a Suzuki to Maira

Salar, Banda Pir Khan, where family dispute of the
wife of Rafagat started and Ruwail fired at him, as a
result thereof, his brother received injuries on his
body.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and the record perused with their
valuable assistance.

4. Perusal of record would reveal that the
accused/petitioner has been charged with specific role
of firing at Rafagat Ali, injured on his left flank. The
injury attributed to the present accused/petitioner
Ruwail being on non-vital part of the body of injured,
would require further probe regarding guilt of the
present accused/petitioner qua attempt to commit
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ during the trial, particularly, when he
has not repeated the fire shot. There was no
dislocation or fracture of any bone. It appears from
record of the medical report that injury caused to the
injured was on his left flank, which fell within the
ambit of section 337-K(iii) PPC. ‘The evidentiary value
of the retracted confession of the accused/petitioner
and recovery of pistol from his possession would
certainly be determined by the learned trial Court after
recording evidence. ‘his Court considers that in view
of peculiar facts and circumstances referred to above,

a case of ‘further inquiry’ into the guilt of the
accused/petitioner is made out, as contemplated in
subsection 2 of section 497 Cr.P.C.
5. The observations rendered hereinabove
being tentative in nature would not affect the mind of
the trial Court in any manner whatsoever, during trial
of the case.
6. Consequently, this bail application is
accepted and accused-petitioner, Ruwail is admitted to
bail, subject to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.200,000/- (Rupees ‘Two lacs), with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
Illaqa/Duty Magistrate, Abbottabad.

Above are the detailed reasons for short
order of this Court of even date.
