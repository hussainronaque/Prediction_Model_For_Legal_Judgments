SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- The convict/
appellant Ghulam Muhammad has called in question
the judgment dated 22.05.2019, passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, D.I.Khan, whereby the
appellant being involved in case F.I.R No. 357 dated
01.08.2014, registered at Police Station Gomal
University, District D.l.Khan, has been convicted
under section 302(b) P.P.C and sentenced to life
imprisonment with Rs.10,00,000/-, (ten lac) as
compensation to the legal heirs of deceased under

section 544-A Cr.P.C, or in default thereof, to further

-2-
undergo for six months simple imprisonment. Benefit
under section 382-B, Cr.P.C was also extended to the
convict, however, co-accused Zafar and Abdullah
were acquitted of the charges.

2. The complainant Eid Nawaz being
aggrieved from the impugned judgment filed Cr.R.
No.10-D/2019, for enhancement of sentence of
appellant and Cr.A. No.44-D/2019, against acquittal
of co-accused. Since all the matters are the outcome of
one and the same judgment, therefore, same are to be
decided through this common judgment.

3. Brief facts of the case, as divulges from the
first information report are that on 01.08.2014 at
19:00 hours, complainant Eid Nawaz along with dead-
body of his brother Muhammad Jehangir, in
emergency room of Civil Hospital, D.I.Khan reported
the matter to the effect that, he along with his
brother Muhammad Jehangir was present in the clinic
of Dr. Farid, situated at Jnok Khalar, where they were
waiting for the doctor for medical treatment of little
daughter of his brother. At about 05:30 hours,
appellant Ghulam Muhammad, duly armed with

pistol, entered the clinic and started firing at his
-3-
brother, resultantly, he was hit, sustained injuries and
died on the spot. The complainant could do nothing
being empty-handed, accused Zafar and Abdullah,
nephews of appellant also made aerial firing. Besides
the complainant, the occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by one PW Inayatullah, his relative and
other persons present on the spot. Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be political rivalry. Ghulam
Muhammad ASI, reduced the report of complainant in
shape of Murasila (Ex: PW 1/2 ) and sent the same to
the Police Station for registration of F.IR. He
prepared injury sheet (Ex: PW 1/2 and = Ex: PW 1/3)
and inquest report and sent the dead-body to the
doctor under the escort of HC Umar Daraz No.491.
After completion of investigation complete challan
was submitted by the S.H.O Abdul Ghaffar ASI
(PW-5) before the learned trial Court. After
commencement of trial the prosecution produced and
examined as many as seven witnesses. On conclusion
of prosecution evidence, statements of accused were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein they
professed their innocence, but neither they wished to

be examined on oath as provided under section
-4-
340(2), Cr.P.C, however, accused Ghulam
Muhammad wished to produce defence evidence and
in this respect Muhammad Irfan Advocate and
Muhammad Ramzan S.J. were examined as DW-1 and
DW-2, respectively. Learned trial Court, after hearing
arguments from both the sides, vide judgment dated
12.07.2016 convicted and sentenced the appellant
Ghulam Muhammad as mentioned above, while
acquitted the accused Zafar and Abdullah. The convict
/appellant Ghulam Muhammad filed criminal appeal
No.42-D/2016, while the complainant Eid Nawaz
filed Cr.R. No.9-D/2016, for enhancement of sentence
of appellant and Cr.A No.43-D/2016 and Cr.A.
No.52-D/2016 against the acquitted co-accused. This
Court after hearing arguments of both sides, vide
judgment dated 08.10.2018, remanded the case back
to the learned trial Court for trial de novo. The
judgment of this Court was questioned before the apex
Court, which was allowed vide judgment dated
31.01.2019, whereby judgment of this Court was
modified and instead of remand of the matter to the
trial Court for de novo trial of respondent No.2

(convict/appellant herein), it was directed to record

“> - > "2. Se —ee
-5-
the statements of Eid Nawaz complainant and
Inayatullah, afresh, in the presence of respondent
No.2, whereafter a fresh statement of respondent No.
2, under section 342 Cr.P.C. was directed to be
recorded to the extent of the fresh evidence brought on
record by the prosecution and then the trial Court was
to pronounce a fresh judgment in the case after
hearing arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties. Learned trial Court after doing the needful and
hearing learned counsel for the parties vide impugned
judgment dated 22.5.2019, again convicted the
appellant Ghulam Muhammad and acquitted the co-
accused Zafar and Abdullah. The convict/appellant
Ghulam Muhammad filed instant CrA. No.39-
D/2019, whereas the complainant Eid Nawaz filed
Cr.R. No.10-D of 2019, for enhancement of sentence
and Cr.A. No.44-D/2019 against the acquittal of co-
accused Zafar and Abdullah.

4. We have heard learned counsel
representing the appellant, Additional Advocate-
General assisted by learned private counsel at length
and with their valuable assistance, the record was

gone through.
-6-
5. Though the effective fire shot was
attributed to the appellant and that single accused is
charged for commission of the offence, but that alone
will not serve the purpose, rather this being the
appellate Court, is under the bounded duty to assess
and re-assess the available evidence on the file and to
appreciate as to whether the learned trial Court was
correct in its approach by convicting the appellant.
True, that in case of single accused, substitution is a
rare phenomenon, but equally true that to charge a
single accused will not absolve the prosecution of its
liability to prove the case through trustworthy and
confidence inspiring witnesses. In order to ascertain as
to whether the impugned judgment is based on proper
reasoning and that the learned trial Court was pleased
to apply its judicial mind to the facts, circumstances
and evidence available on the file, we deem it
essential to thrash out the evidence so to avoid
miscarriage of justice.

6. The prosecution is under obligation to
convince this Court regarding the mode, manner and
the time of incident, and the complainant as well as

the eyewitness are to establish their presence on the
-7-
spot and we are to see as to whether the incident
occurred in the mode, manner and at the stated time.
True, that the matter was reported to the local police
in civil hospital, D.I.Khan at 19:00 hours, and that the
time consumed in reaching to the hospital has been
explained by the witnesses, but we are to assess as to
whether the explanation so tendered has explained the
delay caused. The complainant was examined as
PW-7, who stated that at the relevant time, he
alongwith his deceased brother and his little daughter,
entered the clinic of one doctor Farid, and the moment
they stepped into the clinic, the accused/appellant
entered to the clinic and fired at the deceased with his
.30 bore pistol and that after committing the offence,
the accused went out of the clinic and decamped. He
further stated that being empty-handed, he could do
nothing, however, the moment the appellant left the
clinic, he came after him and saw the acquitted co-
accused making aerial firing. The dead body was
shifted to the hospital and in that respect, PW-7
explained that initially after arranging a cot, they put
the dead body on the cot and started towards the

hospital on foot and that after covering distance for
-8-
long 45 minutes, they arranged a Dala/pickup and put
the dead body therein and reached the hospital. We
are to assess as to whether the events occurred in the
mode as stated by the complainant, if we admit that
the moment the complainant alongwith the deceased
entered to the clinic of the doctor the deceased was
fired at, then in that eventuality the deceased should
have fallen on the ground and even his little daughter
would have received injury but that is not the case.
The complainant is yet to explain that whether the
deceased was sitting on the bench when he received
the firearm injury. The complainant wanted to make
us believe that it was he who accompanied the
deceased to the clinic, but he could not explain that at
what time and where-from they started for the clinic.
Even the Investigating Officer did not explain in the
site plan the presence of the little daughter and even
the presence of the doctor concerned. This is
astonishing that the complainant, while reporting the
matter, did not explain the presence of the eyewitness
Inayat Ullah, and it is at the tale end of his report that
he mentioned the said Inayat Ullah, as the eyewitness.

The complainant, when appeared before the trial

3 gers
-9-
Court, went in an abnormal explanation regarding the
presence of the eyewitness. He stated that when he
reached to the clinic of the doctor, he came across PW
Inayat Ullah, and on his query, he explained that he
was there in connection of his personal business. The
complainant could not explain as to whether the
eyewitness disclosed his purpose on the spot and as to
whether the eyewitness had reached the moment, they
reached the clinic. The complainant went on constant
improvements and stated that soon after the deceased
received the firearm injuries, he breathed his last, and
thereafter, he informed his relatives who approached
to the place of incident and the dead body was shifted
to the hospital. This is surprising that when the
complainant alongwith the eyewitness and other
people were present on the spot, then what need was
felt for the presence of the relatives. This suggests that
in fact the complainant was not present at the time of
incident, and that it was after arrival of the dead body
to the hospital that he alongwith the co-villagers
reached to the hospital. This is abnormal on part of the
complainant that firstly the dead body was shifted to a

cot and then they started on foot towards the hospital
-10-
and that it was after covering a long distance that the
Dala/pickup was arranged and the dead body was
shifted to the hospital. We cannot ignore that the
occurrence took place at 5:30 PM, and the report was
made at 7:00 PM, whereas the distance between the
spot and the hospital was stated to be two furlongs,
when such is the situation, then we are disturbed to
know that what caused this abnormal delay and
instead the dead body should have reached to the
hospital much earlier than the stated time. The
explanation so rendered does not suit the situation at
hand. Inayat Ullah was examined as PW-8, who stated
that on the day of incident, he was present at the place
of occurrence owing to his personal engagement,
though initially, he did not explain that what brought
him to the place of incident, but it was during his
cross-examination that he stated that earlier he had
brought wheat to the adjacent grinding mill and he
was waiting as the grinding mill was closed by the
time. We are surprised that even the complainant was
not certain regarding the engagements the eyewitness
had at the time of incident, and even the eyewitness

could not explain the same. Regarding presence of the
-ll-
eyewitness, the Investigating Officer was examined,
who stated that the eyewitness did not explain the
purpose of his presence and even no wheat belonging
to the eyewitness was either seen or taken into
possession. This is intriguing on part of the eyewitness
and even the Investigating Officer that the miller was
neither associated with the process of investigation,
nor his name was put in the calendar of witnesses, so
much so, his statement was not recorded. The
eyewitness failed to explain his presence on the spot,
as no relevant witness in that respect was examined.
The record tells that the incident occurred on the 34
day of Eid and this is nothing, but abnormal that on
the 3 day of Eid, the eyewitness ran short of flour
that he rushed to the grinding ‘mill. Even the
Investigating Officer was examined on this particular
aspect of the case, who confirmed that being Friday,
the grinding mill was closed.

7. The absence of the witness is further
doubted from the fact that the eyewitness categorically
stated that after making the report, he did not stay in
hospital rather he left for his home and that it was

thereafter that the complainant asked him to adduce
-12-
evidence in his favour, to which he replied that being
natural witness of the occurrence, he must depose.
Another intriguing aspect of the case is that the scribe,
who was examined as PW-1, stated that he drafted the
murasila after the complainant reported the matter and
thereafter, the injury sheet and the inquest report were
prepared. The scribe took us aback, when he stated
that after drafting the murasila, he conveyed the
information to the local police station on his wireless
and it was on his dictation on his wireless set that the
contents of murasila were incorporated in the FIR. He
further stated that it took him ten minutes to dictate
the same on wireless. If we accept what he stated to be
correct, then we are surprised that why the time of
registration of FIR has been mentioned as 20:00
hours, rather the FIR should have bene registered
much earlier to the stated time. The cumulative effect
of the above stated facts, takes us nowhere but to hold
that a conscious attempt was made by the prosecution
to cover the delay and to establish the presence of
witnesses with the deceased at the time of incident and
thereafter at the time of report. We are surprised to

see, when the scribe stated that though he drafted the
-13-
murasila but the injury sheet and inquest report were
prepared by one Umar Daraz Khan, on his dictation.
Surprisingly, said Umar Daraz was not produced as
the prosecution witness. We are yet to know that when
Umar Daraz, being the most important witness was
abandoned, then what value can be attached to the
documents he prepared.

8. The Investigating Officer visited the spot
and recovered one empty of .30 bore from the place of
incident alongwith blood stained earth from the place
of the deceased, he also prepared site plan on
pointation of the complainant. Though the site plan
was prepared and the places of the deceased,
eyewitness and the acquitted co-accused are
mentioned therein, but no empties of 7.62 bore were
recovered from the places of acquitted co-accused.
Even the Investigating Officer did not take into
possession the motorcycle belonging to the deceased.
The presence of the eyewitness is further belied by the
fact that at the time of spot pointation he was not
present with the complainant and that it was the
complainant alone on whose pointation the site plan

was prepared. The eyewitness was thoroughly cross-
-14-
examined on material aspects of the case and was
confronted with his statement recorded, under Section
161, Cr.P.C, by the Investigating Officer. The facts
which he did not disclose during his police statement,
were elaborated when he appeared before the trial
Court as PW-8. The learned defence counsel
confronted this witness with his statement recorded
under section 161, Cr.P.C. When both the statements,
one recoded by the Investigating Officer and the other
recorded by the eyewitness during trial, are placed in
juxtaposition, we are not hesitant to hold that the
eyewitness did not remain natural and consistent to his
previously recorded statement and the improvements
we found in his Court statement are dishonest which
has put a question mark to his integrity. The
prosecution is to explain that when the deceased died
on the spot, then what compelled them to go to the
hospital to report the matter despite the fact the police
station was lying at a closer distance and also one
must pass the police station to reach the hospital. The
abnormal conduct displayed by the witnesses confirms
their absence at the time of incident and we can form

no other opinion but that at the time of incident the
-15-
deceased was all alone who after receiving firearm
injuries died on the spot and his dead body was shifted
to the hospital, by the people of the adjoining houses,
where the matter was kept pending and it was on
arrival of the complainant and the eyewitness, from
their village that the matter was reported.

In case titled ‘Liaquat Hussain and others
Ys. Falak Sher and others (2003 SCMR 611), it was
held by the apex Court

“Eye-witnesses including the
complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable explanation
for being present on the scene of
occurrence and were — chance
witnesses---Prosecution case did not
inspire confidence and fell for short of
sounding probable to a man of
reasonable prudence”.

9. The Investigating Officer was examined as
PW-3, who stated that on arrival to the spot the clinic
of the doctor where the incident occurred was closed,
it was on arrival of the owner of the shop, namely
Bashir who provided keys to the Investigating Officer,
that the door was opened. He further stated that two
empties of .30 bore alongwith blood stained earth
were recovered from the flour of the shop and on
pointation of the complainant the site plan was

prepared. The site plan is silent regarding the
-16-
availability of medicines, the furniture and more
particularly the table and chair of the doctor, which
added to our surprise as to whether it was in fact the
clinic of a doctor. The Investigating Officer did not
record the statements of the people who were
allegedly present at the time of incident and even of
the owner of the shop Muhammad Bashir. It further
surprised us that it was he who provided cot for
shifting of the dead body but the lack of interest on
part of the prosecution further disturbs our judicial
mind, that why such an important witness was not
associated with the process of investigation. Never
ever, the Investigating officer stated that he asked him
for recording his statement and that he denied. The
conduct displayed by the prosecution in general and
the Investigating Officer in particular takes us there
where we have no option but, to take an adverse
inference. The Investigating Officer did not take pains
to ask for the miller who was running the adjoining
grind mill, to confirm the visit of the eyewitness and
even he did not make efforts either to collect the
wheat brought or its presence in the grinding mill.

When the statement of the miller is not recorded and
-17-
the wheat has not been shown then in that eventuality
we are not reluctant to hold that the eyewitness could
not succeed in establishing the purpose of his presence
at the time and at the place of incident. Another
important witness namely Umar Daraz was not
produced by the prosecution as the scribe stated that,
it was he who on his dictation drafted the murasila and
prepared the injury sheet and inquest report. When the
author of such important documents was not produced
then in that eventuality, it is the prosecution to suffer.
The overall impact we see is that, had these witnesses
been produced or their statements recorded, they
would not have supported the false. claim of the
complainant. The law is settled that when the best
available evidence is not produced, then it is the
prosecution to suffer. The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984, in the shape of Article 129(g) has accorded
protection to the accused and the benefit of the
situation must be extended to the one charged.

10. The medical evidence is in conflict with
the ocular account if we presume the statement of the
complainant to be correct then in that eventuality the

seat of injury instead down to upward must have been
-18-
through and through, as according to the complainant
by that time the deceased had not resumed the seat
when he was fired at. The doctor was examined as
PW-2, who stated that the injury given in his detail at
page No.1 and in diagram, suggested that it was from
down to upward. The inter se comparison of what the
complainant stated and the doctor opined, brings us
nowhere but to hold that the medical evidence does
not support the case of the prosecution. True, that
medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and in case
where the ocular account is trustworthy and
confidence inspiring, it cannot be taken into account
to discredit the eyewitness account but in case the
eyewitnesses fail to convince then in that eventuality
it is the medical evidence that steers the wheel. In the
instant case, the conflict between the two suggests that
the incident did not occur in the mode, manner and it
also raises an eyebrow over the conduct and presence
of the complainant at the time of incident.

In case titled ‘Akhtar Saleem and another

Vs. The State and another (2019 MLD Peshawar
1107), it was held that:-
“The above factors, material

contradictions between ocular and
medical evidence create serious
-19-

doubts in the happening of alleged
occurrence and it is well settled law
that even a single doubt, if found
reasonable, would entitle the accused
person to acquittal and not a
combination of several doubts”.

11. The learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that on one hand some of the prosecution
witnesses including the Investigating Officer did not
deny the stance of the complainant and on the other,
the accused/appellant through an application requested
for fair investigation. It was submitted that PW-4 and
the Investigating Officer categorically stated that
some of the people present at the place of occurrence
did not support the case of the prosecution and there
was a general rumour regarding innocence of the
appellant. True, that the appellant submitted an
application to the high-ups regarding fair investigation
which was marked to the concerned Investigating
Officer for probe. As the appellant took the plea of
alibi, stating therein that a day before the occurrence
he was in custody of the police of the police station
Karror Lal Eisan, District Layyah, as his motorcar was
taken from his possession under section 550 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. Though the Investigating

Officer visited the concerned police station and
- 20 -
recorded statements of all concerned including the
police official who arrested the appellant and of an
Advocate with whom the appellant and two others
stayed for a night. The witnesses were produced on
conclusion of the trial, as DW-1 and DW-2 and the
relevant documents were exhibited. The issue before
us is as to whether the evidence produced by the
appellant in his defence could be relied upon and as to
whether the witnesses appeared in defence are
trustworthy. No doubt, the documents regarding
interception of the motorcar were produced and placed
on file and no doubt, the concerned witnesses stated of
his confinement in the police lockup but, that alone is
not sufficient to substantiate the claim of the appellant
rather the appellant in order to prove his presence
there at Punjab, must have produced reliable witnesses
and reliable documents. The documents so produced
cannot be taken into consideration in support of his
plea of alibi. This Court is to determine as to whether
the plea taken and not proved will weigh against the
appellant and so was the submission of the learned
counsel representing the complainant. There is no

ambiguity that if an accused takes a plea regarding his
-21-
innocence and if he does not succeed to prove the
same, it cannot be taken against him, as the
prosecution is still under the bounded duty to establish
its charges and the burden never shifts, however,
when an accused takes the plea of right of self-defence
then in that situation the accused is under the
obligation to prove the same failing which the Court,
dealing with the matter, can take it into consideration
against the accused charged, but in the instant case the
situation is otherwise as it is the prosecution to
establish its case through cogent, convincing and
trustworthy witnesses and the burden never shifts to
the accused/appellant.

In case titled ‘Ali Ahmad and another Vs.

The State and others’ (PLD 2020 S.C. 261), it was
held that:-

“In a case where the accused has
taken a specific plea or has produced
evidence in his defence, the Court
should appraise the prosecution case
and the defense version in
juxtaposition, in order to arrive at a
just conclusion. Even in such situation
the burden remains on _ the
prosecution to prove the necessary
ingredients of the offence charged
against the accused, and it does not
shift upon the accused merely by
taking a defence plea or producing
evidence in his defence”.
-22-

It was further held in the said judgment that:

“The burden shifts upon the accused
under Article 121 of the QSO to prove
his defense plea, only when a prima
facie case is made out against him by
the prosecution on the basis of its
evidence. If the prosecution fails to
prove its case against the accused, the
question of shifting of burden on the
accused does not arise”.

12. The motive was stated to be the political
rivalry between the parties, but the record is silent as
to what status the deceased had, which prompted the
accused to kill him and even the complainant failed to
bring on record material evidence in that respect. The
Investigating Officer did not investigate the case on
that particular line and even no independent witnesses
were examined in that respect. True, that the weakness
or absence of a motive will not knock out the
prosecution from contest, but we cannot ignore that
once the motive is alleged and not proved, then it is
the prosecution to suffer.

13. The cumulative effect of what has been
stated above, leads this Court nowhere but to hold that
the prosecution could not establish guilt of the
appellant and the witnesses failed to establish their
presence on the spot at the time of incident. As the

learned trial Court failed to appreciate the material
-23-
aspects of the case, we feel that the impugned
judgment is suffering from inherent defects which
calls for interference. Resultantly, this appeal is
allowed, impugned judgment is set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charges levelled against
him. He be set free, forthwith, if not required to be
detained in connection with any other criminal case.
As we have set aside the conviction and sentence,
therefore, the connected criminal revision as well as
criminal appeal do not hold ground, are dismissed as
such.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

order of even date.
