JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through
this judgment, we_ shall also decide
Cr.A.No.695-P of 2015 as both the appeals
are the outcome of same FIR bearing
No.574 dated 26.10.2002 u/ss 302/324/34
PPC of Police Station Sardheri District
Charsadda albeit arising out of different
judgments passed by the learned Sessions
Judge and Additional Sessions Judge-l,
Charsadda dated 16.05.2012 and
16.11.2015, respectively, whereby
appellants Shahzeb and Javed Iqbal
have been convicted and sentenced to
imprisonment for life with fine of
Rs.1,00,000/- each or in default whereof to
undergo O06 months SI with benefit

u/s 382-b Cr.P.C.
2. Brief facts of the case are that on
26.10.2002 at 4.30 PM, complainant of the
case, namely, Fakhr-e-Alam reported to
Muhammad Khan, ASHO of PS Sardheri
(PW-10) to the effect that on the day of
occurrence he and his brother
Muhammad _ Siyar (the deceased) were
returning home from their lands and when
they reached the lands of one Ihsan-ud-Din,
there Javed Iqbal, Asad Iqbal and Shahzeb
emerged, who opened firing at them with
their respective pistols as a result his
brother Muhammad Siyar got hit and died
on the spot while he escaped unhurt. The
occurrence was stated to have been
witnessed by another brother of the
complainant, namely, Muntaj Gul. Motive for
the crime, as alleged, was a money dispute
between appellant Javed Iqbal and the
deceased. On the basis of ibid report, case

FIR was registered against the appellants.

3. It is worth to mention that after the
occurrence, all the three accused went into
hiding and resultantly § proceedings

u/s 512 Cr.P.C. were initiated against them,
wherein, statements of the complainant and
Muntaj Gul were recorded. Record shows
that on 09.02.2011, appellant Shahzeb was
arrested, who was put to face the trial. He
pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to prove its case
examined 10 witnesses. It is pertinent to
mention that in the course of trial, the
complainant and his brothers were not
available to record their evidence and their
statements recorded during the course of
proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C. were
transferred to the case file so as to use the

same against the accused.

4. After the prosecution evidence,
statement of the accused was recorded,
wherein, he professed his innocence and
refuted the case against him. The learned
trial court, after conclusion of the trial, found
appellant Shahzeb guilty of the charge and
while recording his conviction sentenced

him as mentioned above.

5. Appellant Javed Iqbal (convict in
Criminal Appeal No.695-P of 2015) was
taken into custody on 20.09.2013. He was

indicted by the learned trial court for the
crime to which he too pleaded not guilty.
Prosecution, in order to prove its case
against him, produced 11 witnesses coupled
with transferring the statements of
complainant and Muntaj Gul to the file of the
case as per Section 512 Cr.P.C. and
Article 46 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984. After closure of the prosecution
evidence, statement of the accused was
recorded, wherein, he confessed his
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found him guilty of
the charge and while’ recording his
conviction sentenced him as mentioned
above. Both the appellants have filed their
separate appeals but as FIR is one and the
same, therefore, their appeals are being

decided through this single judgment.

6. It would not be out of place to
mention here that complainant of the case
has died and his brother Muntaj Gul too is
not traceable as per report of the local
police to this effect. Likewise, other legal
heirs of the deceased were ordered to be
served qua the appeals but none appeared

on behalf of the complainant's - side,
therefore, on 23.05.2017, this court had
ordered the learned AAG to argue the case

in absence of the complainant’s side.

7. Barrister M.Zahur-ul-Haq argued the
case for the appellants while the learned
AAG represented the State. We, with the
assistance of the learned counsel and the
learned AAG also gone through the case

record.

8. Noticeable aspect of the case is that
none of the eyewitnesses appeared before
the learned trial court at the time of trial
against the appellants. Record shows that
on 16.02.2012, the learned prosecutor had
moved an application for transferring the
statements of the aforesaid PWs recorded
during the course of Section 512 Cr.P.C. on
the ground that their attendance could not
be procured. The learned trial court vide
order dated 21.03.2012, accepted the
application and transferred the statements

of the PWs to the file of the case.

9. No doubt, under Article 46 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, and

u/s 512 Cr.P.C., deposition given by a
person before a competent court of law can
be tendered in evidence, if the deponent is
dead or incapable of giving evidence or his
attendance cannot be procured without an
amount of delay, expense or inconvenience
but it has been held umpteenth times by the
superior courts that much sanctity cannot be
attached to the statements of witnesses
recorded u/s 512 Cr.P.C. for safe
administration of justice unless strong
independent corroboratory evidence is
brought by the prosecution in support of

depositions recorded u/s 512 Cr.P.C.

10. In the context of the above, if we
examine the statements recorded by the two
eyewitnesses of the case under the ibid
provisions of law, which have been
transferred by the learned trial court to the
file of the instant case, it would appear that
the ibid evidence gets no corroboration from
medical and circumstantial evidence of the
case. According to the FIR (Ex.PA), the
deceased was fired at by all the three
accused with their respective pistols but
medical evidence furnished by PW-4 shows

that the four wounds sustained by the
deceased are of same dimensions i.e.
1.5x1.5. Similarity in dimensions of the
wounds shows that firing at the deceased
was the job of one man. It is worth to
mention that the Investigating Officer of the
case had collected two empties of .30 bore
pistol from the spot and sent the same to
FSL for ascertaining whether same were
fired from one or more than one weapon.
The FSL report is available on the case file
according to which both the crime empties
have been fired from same weapon, which
aspect of the case shows that the firing was
made by one person. Not only the above but
according to the site plan of the case
(Ex.PB) on both sides of the spot, there
have been shown sugarcane crops and in
the month of October, sugarcane crops
reach to its maximum height. In a situation
where on both sides of the spot, there were
sugarcane crops of maximum height, there
was no logic and necessity for the
appellants to come across the complainant
side face to face. They could have easily
achieved their target while hiding in the
sugarcane crops’ without exposing

themselves to the opponents. Ibid aspect of
the case shows that both the eyewitnesses
were not present on the spot. Even, if for the
sake of arguments, it is presumed that they
were present on the spot, then keeping in
view the medical evidence of the victim and
the FSL report, it can be held that they have
given an exaggerated account of the
occurrence and on this score too, their

evidence cannot be accepted.

11. A further pronounced aspect of the
case is that in support of the convictions, the
learned trial courts have relied upon the
confessional statement of appellant
Shahzeb. Record shows that said appellant
was arrested on 09.02.2011 and his
confession was recorded on 13.02.2011.
Not only that the confession was recorded
on the 3% day of his arrest but same goes
quite contrary to what the complainant has
alleged in his FIR. According to the FIR, all
the three accused fired at the deceased
when they emerged on the spot. In the FIR,
the complainant has given a story, which is
not in consonance with the retracted judicial
confession of appellant Shahzeb. In his

retracted judicial confession, the appellant
has said that on the spot, the deceased had
planned to fire at them but before he could
do so, appellant Javed Iqbal fired at him
whereafter he also fired. It appears from the
confessional statement that initial firing was
made by appellant Javed Iqbal and not
appellant Shahzeb but leaving aside the ibid
aspect of the case, as the retracted judicial
confession was recorded after about 9 years
of the incident and after about 3 days of the
appellant's arrest, therefore, no sanctity
could be attached to it because it is not
appealable to prudent mind that after about
9 years, all of a sudden, a culprit would
confess his guilt. In the above
circumstances of the case, it would not be
safe to rely upon the retracted judicial
confession for its not being voluntary one
and getting no corroboration from

circumstantial aspect of the case.

12. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved its case against
the appellants beyond any reasonable
doubt, which is’ hallmark of criminal

jurisdiction. It has been held umpteenth
10

times by the superior courts that in order to
convict an accused, the prosecution has to
prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and
if a single doubt accrues in the prosecution
case benefit of that will be given to the
accused being a century old principle of law.
It appears to us that the learned trial courts
have not appreciated the case evidence in
its true perspective and in line with the
settled principle of criminal law and have
fallen in error by convicting the appellants
for which the impugned judgments are not

sustainable.

13. For what has been discussed above,
this and the connected appeal are allowed,
conviction and sentence of the appellants
are set aside and they are acquitted of the

charges leveled against them.

14. Above are the reasons of our short
order of even date, which is reproduced as

under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later,
this appeal is allowed, conviction
and sentence recorded by learned
Sessions Judge, Charsadda
vide impugned judgment
dated 16.05.2012 is set aside. The
11

appellant is acquitted of the charge
leveled against him and be set free

forthwith, if not required in any other

case”.
