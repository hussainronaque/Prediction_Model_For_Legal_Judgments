Cr.M/B.No. 795-A/2018.

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 03/12/2018

Petitioner (Kazim Khan) By Mr. Atif Ali Jadoon,
Advocate.

State by: Sardar Muhammad Asif, Assistant
AG along with Hammad Hussain

SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J:-
Through this single order, I intend to dispose of
instant Bail petition as well as connected bail
petition bearing No. 848-A of 2018 as both the
petitions are outcome of one and the same FIR.

2. Petitioners Kazim Khan and Liaqat
Ali seek their release on bail in case FIR No.
49/2018 dated 20.06.2018 under Section 18-B &
22-B of Emigration Ordinance, 1979, Police

station FIA/ACC, Abbottabad.
3. Accused/petitioners as per FIR are
charged for defrauding the complainant on the
pretext of sending him abroad on work visas and
obtaining huge amount from him in this respect.
4, Arguments heard and record gone
through.
5. Record reveals that main
allegations of the complainant is that he was
defrauded by the accused/petitioners on the
pretext of sending him abroad on work visa.
There is nothing on record to suggest that the
amount was utilized by the accused/petitioners,
rather there is a visa duly issued in the name of
complainant for Oman. The question as to
whether the accused/petitioners defrauded the
complainant or the complainant himself was not
willing to go abroad on the said visa, can only be
decided by the learned trial court. The offence
for which the accused are charged, provides
alternate punishment i.e. imprisonment for
fourteen years or fine or both, therefore, this
Court considers that if ultimately the trial court

arrives at conclusion to award only the sentence
of fine in view of the facts and circumstances of
the case then withholding bail of the petitioners
would amount to incarceration before judgment
and also to deprive them from their liberty. The
inquiry/investigation in the case is almost
complete and they are no more required by the
prosecution for the purpose of investigation.

6. In view of the above facts and
circumstances of the case, both the petitions in
hand stand accepted. Resultantly, petitioners are
admitted to bail on furnishing bail bonds in the
sum of Rs. 200,000/- (two hundred thousand)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate
concerned. Sureties must be local, reliable and
men of means.

7. These are the reasons for short

order of the even date.
