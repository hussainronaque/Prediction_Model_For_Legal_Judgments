JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- Through
this judgment, we shall also decide the
connected criminal appeal bearing No.
540-P of 2017 as both the appeals have
emanated from same _ FIR  No.249
dated 14.3.2003 u/ss 302/324/34 PPC of
Police Station, Tangi District Charsadda
whereby the learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Charsadda at Tangi through two
separate judgments dated 25.10.2011 and
19.07.2017 have convicted both the
appellants u/s 302 PPC and sentenced
each of them to imprisonment for life on two
counts with payment of compensation of
Rs.1,00,000/- to the legal heirs of both the
deceased or in default whereof to undergo 6

months S.I. They have also been convicted
u/s 324 PPC’ and_ sentenced _ to
imprisonment of seven years R.1. with fine of
Rs.5,000/- or in default whereof to further
suffer ten months S.I. The appellants have
further been convicted u/s 337-F (ii)/34 PPC
and sentenced to pay Rs.10,000/- to the
complainant as Daman or in default whereof
to remain in jail till its payment. Benefit
u/s 382-B Cr.P.C. has been extended to the
appellants. All the sentences were ordered

to run concurrently.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
14.3.2003, complainant Amanullah (PW-11)
reported to ASI Shah Jehan Khan (PW-2) at
Civil Hospital Tangi to the effect that on the
day of occurrence there had been a quarrel
between deceased Naveed and appellant
Ghafoor on which deceased Daud, brother
of deceased Naveed, complained to
Ghafoor which annoyed him. Complainant
went on alleging in his FIR that at the time
of occurrence he and his nephews i.e., both
the deceased, were present on the spot
when in the meanwhile Riaz and Ghafoor
came there duly armed and opened firing at

them with which he, Daud and Naveed were
hit and injured. Daud died on the spot while

Naveed succumbed to his injury later on.

3. On arrest of accused Riaz, complete
challan was put in court, which indicted him
for commission of the offence to which he
pleaded not guilty. After conclusion of the
trial, the learned trial court found him guilty
and while’ recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above vide

judgment dated 25.10.2011.

4. Thereafter, on 01.10.2014, appellant
Ghafoor was arrested, who was indicted for
the crime to which he too pleaded not guilty.
Prosecution in order to prove its case
produced evidence whereafter the learned
trial court found him guilty of the charge and
while recording his conviction sentenced

him vide judgment dated 19.07.2017.

5. Both the convicts have impugned
their convictions, which are being decided
through this single judgment, being the

outcome of same FIR.

6. Arguments heard and record gone

through.
7. Instant is a case, wherein, two
persons have lost their lives while one has
critically been injured for which two persons,
who are father and son, have been charged.
No doubt, the occurrence was _ reported
within a short span of time, wherein, both
the accused have been charged for effective
firing at the three victims but whether the act
of taking the lives of two and rendering the
third one injured is the job of one or more
than one person is the crucial question,
which this court will determine in light of the

case evidence.

8. Perusal of the case record would
show that in support of the prosecution’s
case complainant appeared as PW-11
whereas eyewitness Sher Bahader testified
as PW-12. Both the witnesses have
deposed in line with what was alleged in the
FIR (Ex.PA/1) but noticeable aspect of the
case is that both the appellants have been
assigned the role of simultaneous firing at
both the deceased and the injured i.e.
PW-11. According to the record, both the
eyewitnesses have admitted that they

did not know that with whose fire shot who
was hit or that how many shots were fired
by the accused. Ordinarily, no victim or a
witness can give a photographic account of
an occurrence or the detail of shots fired by
an accused or that with whose shot who
was hit but when the deceased or injured
sustained a single wound, as in the case of
both the deceased, then in that situation the
person, who claims to be an eyewitness of
the occurrence, must specify the accused
by name, who has caused the fatal shot in
case more than one accused are charged
for the crime but in the case in hand, the
complainant, who himself bears the stamp
of injuries on his person, was unable to
point out the particular assailant, who had
fired at him. Likewise, he could not identify
that who out of the two accused had fired at
which deceased. Same is the position of
eyewitness Sher Bahader, who too did not
know that who amongst the two assailants,
had fired at the injured and the deceased.
Non-specification of the accused for firing at
a particular victim, in the attending
circumstances of the case, shows that the

charge leveled by the two prosecution
witnesses against the appellants is

exaggerated one.

9. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that the Medical Officer, who had
examined the deceased and the injured, has
not given dimensions of injuries sustained
by the victims. Giving dimensions of the
injuries sustained by the victims was must
so as to know through medical evidence
that more than one weapon were used and
more than one persons had participated in
the crime. Failure to mention the dimensions
of injuries on the bodies of the victims has
caused colossal damage to _ the
prosecution’s case because in absence
whereof it cannot be safely held that the
casualties were caused by two persons as

has been claimed.

10. Further noticeable aspect of the case
is that the motive taken in the FIR for
commission of the offence has not been
proved. No doubt, establishing a motive for
a crime is not necessary as crimes are often
committed sans any motive but when in the
FIR same is alleged, then its establishment

becomes necessary. Besides, the motive
alleged by the complainant is so trivial that it
cannot be made a base for a father and son
to come together on the spot duly armed
and take the lives of two and rendering

another as injured.

11. | Another important aspect of the case
is that from the spot one empty of .30 bore
has been recovered, which shows that in
the crime .30 bore pistol was used but in the
FIR the complainant has alleged that the
accused had come on the spot with
‘Aslaha Atishsheen. Being villagers, the
complainant and eyewitness Sher Bahadar
were supposed to distinguish between pistol

and ‘Aslaha Atishsheen’.

12. True that the complainant bears
firearm injuries on his person and ordinarily
presence of a person on a crime spot, who
has a stamp of injury on his person, is
accepted but it is well settled that if the
prosecution story does not get corroboration
from overall surrounding circumstances of
the case, then mere stamp of injury on the
body of a person would not be sufficient to
hold that whatever he has testified is a

whole truth. As there is no independent
corroboration to the testimony of the injured
witness, therefore, for the safe
administration of justice, we are unable to
give any credit to his evidence albeit he has

firearm injuries on his person.

13. So far as the evidence of PW
Sher Bahader is concerned, suffice it to say
that his presence on the spot is not
established through worth reliable evidence,
therefore, his testimony too is kept out of

consideration.

14. Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has not proved beyond any
shadow of doubt that the appellants had
committed the offence they were charged
with. It appears from the record that the
occurrence was the act of one person but
with mala fide intention through an
exaggerated charge two persons were
roped in the case, which practice is very
common in the country. As there is no clear-
cut evidence that who amongst the
appellants has committed the offence,
therefore, we give benefit of doubt to both

the appellants-accused as it is better that
ten guilty persons escape than one innocent

suffer.

15. For what has been discussed above,
we accept both the appeals, set aside the
impugned judgments and acquit the
appellants of the charges leveled against
them. They be set at liberty forthwith, if not

required to be detained in some other case.

16. Above are the reasons of our short
order of even date, which is reproduced as

under:-

“For the reasons to be recorded later, this appeal
is allowed, conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Charsadda at Tangi vide
impugned judgment dated 25.10.2011 delivered in
case FIR No.249 dated 14.03.2003 u/ss
302/324/337-F(ii)/34 PPC of Police Station Tangi,
Charsadda are set aside. He is acquitted of the
charge leveled against him and be set free
forthwith if not required to be detained in any other

case”.
