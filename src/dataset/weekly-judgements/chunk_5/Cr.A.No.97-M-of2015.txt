appellants Ghulam Murtaza and Muhammad Din

have been convicted and sentenced as under:

Ghulam Murtaza

(i) Five years R.I under section 6 of the
Explosive substances Act, 1908.

(ii) Fine of Rs.5000/- under section 5 of
Explosive Act, 1884 or in default

Muhammad Din

2. Precise and relevant facts of the case are
that Muhammad Sohail, Admin SAMBO
Construction Company Koghozi, Chitral on
15.2.2012 at 18:00 hours, moved an application
addressed by Jae Gi Lim, Administration/
Procurement Manager of the said Company, wherein
the occurrence of theft regarding explosives
containing 22 boxes, weighing 550 kilograms of
Wabax Special worth Rs.700,821.5/- from Magazine
located in Golen Gole Warehouse was reported. On

the strength of this application/written report,

ACE No. 97-M of 2015 Ghutamt Murua V's, The State and another]
-3- ies
Mursila was drafted which later on culminated into
F.ILR, Ex.PW-12/1,
3. During the course of investigation, the
aid of sniffer dogs was availed and as a result
thereof one Dil Muhammad, who was working as a
foreman in the Company, was nominated in the case
as an accused that was discharged on 25.2.2013 on
application of the DPP. During onward investigation
in the case, the Present appellants,convicts
alongwith their seven other co-accused were
nominated in the case and challan was submitted in
the Court for trial of the accused. Formal charge was
framed against the accused to which they pleaded
not guilty and opted to face the trial, hence, the
Prosecution evidence was called for. The
Prosecution produced and examined as many as 16
Witnesses and closed its evidence. Thereafter, the
trial Court recorded statements of the accused under
Section 342 Cr.P.C wherein they denied the

allegations levelled by the Prosecution, however,

Awe B

Tejanubess

aoe
-4.- —"

they did not opt either to be examined on oath in
ferms of section 340(2), Cr.P.C or to produce any
evidence in their defense.

On conclusion of the trial, the present
appellants/convicts alongwith co-accused Ihsanullah
and Tanvir Ahmad were found guilty of the charge
vide the impugned judgment dated 10.4.2015. Being
aggrieved of their conviction mentioned in Para
No.1, the appellant/convict Ghulam Murtaza has
filed the instant appeal and the appellant/convict
Muhammad Din has challenged his conviction
through the connected Cr.A No. 101-M/2015
whereas the State is seeking enhancement of
Sentence awarded to appellant/convict Ghulam
Murtaza through Cr.R No. 36-M/2015, which are
being disposed of through this single judgment.

4. Learned counsel for the appellants
contended that the impugned Judgment of the
learned trial Court is against the law and facts

available on the record; that the trial Court has based

ICt. No 97-84 of 2018 Gindarn Munaza Vs. The Suse and another]
conviction of the appellants on weak and irrelevant
circumstantial evidence which is not legally
sustainable; that the learned trial Court has
misinterpreted the prosecution evidence and did not
analyze the same in its true perspective, hence, the
conclusion arrived at by the trail Court is erroneous;
that the prosecution evidence is suffering from
glaring contradictions on material points which have
not been considered by the trial Court while
recording conviction of the appellants/convicts
besides, the fact that there is no eye witness to the
occurrence, has also been ignored by the trial Court.
The learned counsel lastly contended that two co-
accused namely Ihsanullah and Tanvir Ahmad have
been acquitted by this Court, hence, the present
appellants are also entitled to their outright acquittal.
5. On the contrary, learned A.A.G
appearing on behalf of the State contended that the
prosecution has proved its case against the

appellants/convicts through convincing evidence,

\

ee

hence, the impugned judgment of the trial Court is
legally correct and warrants no interference by this
Court. He maintained that the prosecution had
discharged its onus and the material available on the
record especially the confessional statements of the
appellants/convicts are sufficient for their
conviction. He concluded that the trial Court has
passed the impugned judgment after proper appraisal
of the evidence available on the record, therefore,
the appellants/convicts deserve to undergo the

sentence awarded to them through the impugned

judgment.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
7. In light of arguments, perusal of the

record would reveal that the appellant/convict
Ghulam Murtaza had been charged for purchase of
the stolen explosives and retaining its possession for
onward sale thereof whereas the appellant/convict
Muhammad Din had been charged for stealing the

explosives from SAMBU Construction Company.

ICr.A No. 97-M of 2015 Ghulam Murtaza Vs The State ang auother}

It is a noticeable fact that nothing on the
record is available to show that the appellant/convict
Ghulam Murtaza had the knowledge or reason to
believe that the explosives were stolen. Record
shows that a part of the explosives have been
recovered from the ammunition store of Chitral
Scouts allegedly sold to it by appellant/convict
Ghulam Murtaza and co-accused Maghfirat Shah,
however, the same recovery has not been produced
before the Court for exhibition. Even the FSL report
in this regard has not been exhibited during the trial
which is a glaring irregularity committed by the trial
Court.

8. Record also shows that the occurrence
took place on 15.2.2012 whereas the appellants were
arrested on 15.1.2013 i.e after one year of the
occurrence. Moreso, there is no eye witness to the
occurrence and no recovery of the explosives has
been effected from the direct possession of the

appellants/convicts.

9. No doubt, the appellants/convicts have
recorded their confessional statements before the
Court but later on they retracted the same while
recording their statements under section 342, Cr.P.C.
It is true that conviction of an accused can be based
even on retracted confession made by him provided
the same is duly corroborated by the remaining
evidence on the record but on the other hand
nomination of the appellants/convicts in the present
case at a belated Stage, the fact that the occurrence is
unseen, recovery of the explosives not from the
Possession of the appellants/convicts and non
Production of the explosives before the Court
coupled with non-exhibition of the FSL report are
the factors which have created a dent in the
Prosecution case, Thus, it is held that the
confessional statements are not duly corroborated by
other circumstantial evidence and conviction on the

basis thereof is not correct,

10. In view of the above discussion, the
instant appeal as well as the connected CrA
No. 101-M/2015 are allowed, the impugned
judgment dated 10.4.2015 of the trial Court is set
aside and the appellants are acquitted of the charge
levelled against them. The appellants are on bail,
hence, their sureties are absolved from the liability
of bail bonds. The connected Cr.R No.36-M/2015,

being devoid of Merits, stands dismissed.
