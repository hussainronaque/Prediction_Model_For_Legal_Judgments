Arbab Tehsinullah .Vs. Riaz and others

JUDGMENT
Date of hearing...28/07/2017.
Petitioner by Saif Ullah Khalil (Senior), Advocate

State by Mian Arshad Jan, AAG
Respondents by Mr. Saadatullah Khan, advocate.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J:- Arbab Tehsinullah through
this criminal revision petition under section 439 read
with section 435 Criminal Procedure Code calls in
question the order dated 12.1.2017 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-V, Peshawar, through which
_ application of respondent No.1 to 3 for return of
goods/items taken into custody by respondent No.4, was
allowed and the petitioner was directed to return or to

pay its market value to respondents No.1 to 3.
2. Precise facts of the case are that on
07.12.1991, the present respondent No.1 to 3 after their
arrest were charged under section 302/34 PPC. During
investigation of the said case, the I.O took into custody
the household articles/items of the respondent No.1 to 3
and prepared the Superdagi Nama available on record
Ex.PC/5 on 08.12.1991 according to which the list of
said articles were prepared and handed over to the
present petitioner. The respondent No.1 to 3 were tried
by the then learned Additional Sessions Judge/ JSC-V,
Peshawar and convicted them in the year 2000. An
appeal was filed against the said conviction before this
court and they were acquitted of the charge in the year
2002 by this court. In the year 2014, the present
respondent No.1 to 3 filed an application under secton
517 Cr.P.C before the Sessions Judge, Peshawar for
return of the items/articles as per Ex.PC/5. After
recording certain statements, the application was
accepted by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-V,
Peshawar and the present petitioner was directed to
return all the articles/items as per Ex.PC/5 to the present

respondent No.1 to 3. Feeling aggrieved with the said
order, petitioner has invoked the revisional jurisdiction of

this court under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and A.A.G have been heard and record gone

through.

4. Before adverting to the merits of the case,
first this court will take into consideration Section 517
Cr.P.C which provides the scheme for the return of the
case property after the conclusion of trial. For
convenience the text of section 517 Cr.P.C is replicated

as under:-

“517. Order for disposal of property
regarding which offence committed. (1)
When an inquiry or a trial in any
Criminal Court is concluded, the Court
may make such orders as it thinks fit for
the disposal by destruction,
confiscation, or delivery to any person
claiming to be entitled to possession
thereof or otherwise of any property or
document produced before it or in its
custody or regarding which any offence
appears to have committed, or which

has been used for the commission of the

offence.
(2). When a High Court or a Court of
Sessions makes such order and cannot
through its own officers conveniently
deliver the property to the person
entitled thereto, such Court may direct
that the order be carried into effect by
the District Magistrate.

(3) When an order is made under this
section such order shall not, except
where the property is livestock or
subject to speedy and natural decay, and
save as provided sub section (4) be
carried out for one month or when an
appeal is presented , until such appeal
has been disposed of.

(4) Nothing in this section shall be
deemed to prohibit any Court from
delivering any property under the
provision of sub-section (I) to any
person claim to be entitled to the
possession thereof, on his executing a
bond with or without sureties to the
satisfaction of the Court, engaging to
restore such property to the Court if the
order made under this section is
modified or set aside on appeal.
Explanation. In this section the term
“property” includes the case of property
regarding which an offence appears to
have been committed, not only such

property as has been originally in the
possession or under the control of any
party, but also any property into or for
which the same may have been
converted or exchanged, and anything
acquired by such conversion or
exchange, whether immediately or

otherwise.”

5. In view of the Sub-section | of section 517
Cr.P.C this court is of the opinion that it deals with the
disposal at the conclusion of the inquiry or trial of such
property as well as property produced before the Court
or in its custody. The essential conditions for the
application of this section are as follows:-

1. The property in respect of which
the order is to be made must be one
(a) which has been produced before
the Court, or
(b) _ which is in its custody, or
2. regarding which any offence
appears to have been committed or,
3. which has been used for the
commission of any offence.
It will thus be seen that the result of
inquiry or trial is immaterial for the
purpose of attracting the provisions of
section 517. On the conclusion of the
inquiry or trial, the Court is empowered

to pass necessary orders as it thinks fit in

respect of the disposal of the property
provided that one of the sub-condition of
condition No.3 stated above is fulfilled.

i. AIR 1944 Nagpur, “Bhimji Ramii
Gujrathi Vs Emperor”

ii, P.L.D 1959 Lahore 151 “Syed Bahadur

Ali Shah vs Muhammad Anwar and

another”
6. From the above mentioned discussion and
reading of section 517 Cr.P.C, it is obvious that the court
after delivering the final judgment is competent to pass
an order for the return or otherwise of the case property.
Now it is to be seen whether the articles mentioned in
EX.PC/5 qualify its return under section 517 Cr.P.C or
not, The articles in question were taken into possession
on 8.12.1991 by the investigating officer and were
allegedly handed over to the petitioner which he had
denied throughout. The said articles were neither
produced before the court during trial nor exhibited.
Similarly, the same were neither used in the commission
of the offence nor any offence appears to have been

committed regarding the same or that the same has been”
used for the commission of the offence for the reason that
the same were not having a remote connection with the
alleged crime. Besides, the memo was exhibited during
the trial of the accused in their immediate presence but
even then at that point of time they did not raise any

claim for the return of the property.

7. The articles allegedly taken into possession
were on the second day of the occurrence i.¢e.8.12.1991.
The police authorities were not competent without
initiating proceedings under section 87/88 Cr.P.C
wherein a special mechanism has been provided.
Proceedings under section 204 Cr.P.C were carried out
on 20.12.1991 while proclamation proceedings under
section 87 Cr.P.C were carried out on 13.1.1992. The
goods in question were taken into possession prior to
initiation of the proceedings but this relates to the police
officials and the petitioner has got nothing to do with the

abovementioned proceedings.

8. The learned Additional Sessions Judge has
dealt with the matter when the application was submitted
to him on 23.5.2014 whereas the respondents were

acquitted by this court on 26.11.2002 i.e almost after
Lifer

about 12 years. No plausible reason has been advanced
by the respondents neither in their petition before the trial
court even they were unable to satisfy this court for such
a long delay for the return of the above mentioned

articles. No doubt that under the law, there is no statutory

_ period of limitation for filing an application under section

517 Cr.P.C, but at the same time it must be within
reasonable time or if not within reasonable time there
must be some reasonable explanation for it which is not

available in the present case.

9. For what has been discussed above, the
instant revision petition is allowed and the the order of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-V dated 12.1.2017 is
set aside. The present respondents are, however, at liberty

to agitate the matter before the Civil Court, if so

Announced.
