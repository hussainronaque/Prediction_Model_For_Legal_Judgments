SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.-
Through this single judgment, this Court shall
dispose of three bail petitions, as all these petitions
pertain to one and the same case F.I.R. The
particulars of the bail petitions are as under:

(i) Cr.M No.405-A/2017 Zaheer Ahmad Vs.
The State and another.

(ii) Cr.M No.387-A/2017 Muhammad Naeem
Vs. The State and another.

(iii) Cr.M No.388-A/2017 Zakir Vs. The State
and another.

Accused-petitioners, Zaheer Ahmad, Muhammad

Naeem and Zakir seek their post arrest bail in case

FIR No.441 dated 01.05.2017 under sections
419/420/468/471/34 of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860
registered at Police Station City, Mansehra.

2. The case of the prosecution against the
petitioners, registered on the report of complainant
Jehanzeb, is that he is a property dealer at Mansehra;
that on 15.03.2017, Muhammad Naeem, Zakir, Nazir
Khan, Muhammad Waseem came into his office
‘Muslim Property Dealer’ and Nazir told him that he
wants to sell his property bearing Khasra No.618, 508
and 537, measuring 59 kanals 5 marlas, situated in
Mauza Batdarian. The complainant after satisfaction
regarding genuineness of ownership, struck bargain
for a sum of Rs.41,800,000 and paid them cash
amount of Rs.4,500,000/- and also issued a cheque of
Rs.1,500,000/- to them. Later on, the complainant
after an inquiry into the matter, came to know that the
real owner of the property in question namely, Nazir
son of Abdur Rehman, is an insane person and his
father denied sale of the property and he also came to
know that the person introduced himself as Nazir is
actually Zaheer son of Abdur Rehman. The
complainant charged the said persons for cheating and
defrauding the complainant by obtaining a huge
amount of  Rs.60,000,000/- from him by

impersonation.
3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
accused/petitioners and learned State counsel assisted
by learned counsel for the complainant heard and
record perused with their able assistance.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the
complainant after his satisfaction about the
genuineness of the ownership of the property entered
into the alleged bargain of the property and paid
Rs.4,500,000/- cash and a cheque of Rs.1,500,000/- to
the present accused/petitioners and the co-accused
Abdur Rashid on 15.03.2017, whereas the present
F.ILR has been lodged against the accused/petitioners
on 01.05.2017 after delay of 45 days. Moreover, it is
astonishing that the complainant before lodging the
present F.I.R. against the accused/petitioners has
obtained affidavits and promissory notes of
Rs.14,300,000/- from them, which amount is double
than the amount in question, which creates doubt.
The I.O has not recorded the statements of the
witnesses of the affidavits as well as statement of
Bank Manager of MCB regarding confirmation of
encashment of cheque of Rs.1,500,000/- by the
accused/petitioners. At this moment this Court
cannot enter into threadbare discussion regarding the

transaction took place between the parties, as it is the
job of the trial Court, however, in view of the peculiar
facts and circumstances, this Court considers that the
case against the petitioners is that of further inquiry
into their guilt. Moreover, the offence under section
419 PPC provides three years punishment, whereas
section 420 PPC is bailable and in view of the facts of
the present case, sections 468/471, prima facie seem
to be not applicable to the case of the petitioners.

5. In Zafar _Iqbal’s_ case (2009 SCMR
1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex Court has
explicitly expressed the principles for considering the
grant of bail, where offences do not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C. The said
principles have consistently been followed by the
Honourable Supreme Court, as it has been held in

Riaz Jafar Natiq’s case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid
down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v.
Muhammad Anwar and others (2009
SCMR 1488) ordaining that where a
case falls within non-prohibitory
clause the concession of granting bail
must be favourably considered and
should only be declined in exceptional
cases. We do not find this to be a case
where it should be refused as an
exception. Thus, this petition is
converted into an appeal and the
same is allowed and, resultantly, the
petitioner is admitted to bail subject to
Surnishing bail bond in the sum of Rs.
1,00,000 (Rupees one hundred
thousand only) with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction
of the learned trial Court.”
6. In any case, investigation in the
present case is complete and __ the
accused/petitioners are not required to the police
for the purpose of further investigation. In peculiar
facts and circumstances of the present case, no
useful purpose is going to be served by keeping
them behind the bars.

7. Consequently, these bail applications are
accepted and accused-petitioners, Zaheer Ahmad,
Muhammad Naeem and Zakir is admitted to bail,
subject to their furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs.100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousands), each,
with two sureties, each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the [//aqa/Duty Magistrate, Mansehra.
8. The observations rendered hereinabove,
would not affect the mind of the trial Court in any

manner whatsoever, during trial of the case.
