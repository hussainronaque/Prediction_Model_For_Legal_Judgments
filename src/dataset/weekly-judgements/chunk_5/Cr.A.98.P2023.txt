JUDGMENT

SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- Through this single
judgment, we shall also decide the connected Cr.R
bearing No.41-P/2023 titled “Muhammad Idrees
Vs. Muhammad Adnan etc.” as not only both these
matters arise from the same FIR bearing No.212
dated 02.05.2019 under sections 302/34 PPC of
Police Station Sheikh Matoon District Mardan, but
have also emanated from same judgment of the
learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge MCTC,
Mardan dated 14.01.2023, whereby appellant
Muhammad Adnan has been convicted and

sentenced as under:-

“Uls 302 (b) PPC for life imprisonment
as Tazir with fine of Rs.400,000/- (four
lac) as compensation to be paid to the
legal heirs of deceased under section
544-A Cr.P.C and recoverable as
2

arrears of land revenue from the
person and estate of convict or in
default whereof to further suffer 06
months SI.

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C has
been extended to appellant.”

2. Brief but relevant facts of the instant case as
per first information report are that on 02.05.2019
Said Ali Shah ASI on receipt of information arrived
at the spot house, where the dead body of the
deceased Mst. Rabia Bilqees was laying and
complainant Muhammad Idrees s/o Muhammad
Khan alongwith his son Muhammad Naveed and
other inmates of his house were present with the
dead body, who reported the matter to him that the
marriage of the deceased Mst. Rabia Bilgees had
taken place with the accused Muhammad Adnan
some 8/9 years prior to the occurrence and she
alongwith her husband was residing in a house
situated near to his house. On the fateful day i.e.
02.05.2019 at 2200 hours, he alongwith his son
Muhammad Naveed were busy in repairing the
outer door of their house when suddenly, heard
sound of hue and cry, upon which they rushed to
the house of the accused, where apart from the
spouses one Muhammad Imran, brother of the
accused was also present armed with pistol and on
seeing them the accused Adnan opened firing at his

wife, as a result she got hit and died on the spot.
3

Apart from him (the complainant) the occurrence
has witnessed by his son Muhammad Naveed. After
the occurrence the accused decamped from the
spot. Motive behind the occurrence was dispute
over domestic affairs. They could do nothing being
empty handed. He charged the above named
accused for the murder of his sister, hence the
present FIR.

3. On arrest of the appellant and completion of
investigation, challan was submitted against the
accused before the Court of competent jurisdiction,
charge was framed to which he did not plead guilty
and claimed trial. As such, the learned trial Court
was pleased to direct the prosecution to produce its
evidence. In order to prove its claim, prosecution
produced and examined as many as 12 witnesses,
whereafter statement of the accused was recorded,
where he professed his innocence but did not opt to
record his statement under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C.
After conclusion of trial, the learned trial court found
the appellant guilty of the charge and whilst
recording his conviction, sentenced him as stated
above, hence the instant criminal appeal.

4. We have heard learned counsel for the
appellant, learned AAG, assisted by learned

counsel for the complainant and with their able
4

assistance the record of the case was scanned
through.

5. The unfortunate lady lost her life on receiving
firearm injuries. The matter was reported by the
complainant to the local police on the spot. The
appellant alongwith his brother i.e. the acquitted co-
accused, were charged for the murder of the
deceased. The report was reduced in the shape of
murasila by PW-2 Said Ali Shah ASI. The injury
sheet and inquest report were prepared and the
dead body was handed over to Rescue 1122 for
shifting the same to the hospital. The investigating
officer visited the spot and on pointation of the
complainant prepared the site plan. During spot
inspection the investigating officer collected blood
stained piece, from the sheet of the bed, where the
deceased was sitting at the time of occurrence and
also took into possession an empty of .30 bore
alongwith a spent bullet from the floor of the room.
The accused were arrested and during investigation
the co-accused Muhammad Imran produced .30
bore pistol to the investigating officer, declared the
same as the weapon of offence and the same was
taken into possession. The empties collected from
the spot were sent to the Firearms Expert and also

the spent bullet, wherefrom a report was received by
5

telling that the empty was that of .30 bore, but in
respect of the spent bullet no definite opinion could
be given. The accused were charge sheeted, trial
commenced which ended in the conviction of the
appellant and the acquittal of the co-accused.

6. The learned trial Court took into consideration
the evidence on file and found the appellant
responsible for the death of the deceased. True that
the learned trial Court through a comprehensive
judgment convicted and sentenced the appellant
and equally true that the material aspects of the
case were taken into consideration, but this Court is
to see as to whether the approach of the learned
trial Court was correct and was in accordance with
law and also that the learned trial judge applied his
judicial mind to the evidence on file and the
statements of the witnesses. We are conscious of
the fact that the incident occurred inside the house
of the appellant and ‘the relation between the
appellant and the deceased was that of the husband
and wife, so in such eventuality this Court is to see
as to whether the appellant could be burdened with
the liability to convince the circumstances, in which
the death of the deceased occurred and as to
whether in the like circumstances the only

responsible person would be the appellant. We
6

deem it essential to scan through the record and to
re-assess the already assessed evidence, so that
miscarriage of justice could be avoided. As in the
instant case apart from the liability of the
husband/appellant, we have two eyewitnesses i.e.
the complainant and his son, who deposed that the
incident occurred in their immediate presence.
When such is the state of affairs, then the foremost
duty of this Court is to see as to whether it is the
husband/appellant to convince the circumstances
which led to the death of the deceased or these are
the witnesses who are to prove that the killer is the
appellant, as they claimed to be the witnesses of the
incident. When the witnesses claimed their
presence, then liability remains on the shoulders of
the prosecution, and the witnesses must tell the
manner in which the incident occurred and the
witnesses must convince that it was the accused
who killed the deceased. In case the witnesses do
not succeed, then the Court can look into the matter
by taking into consideration the available
circumstances of the case and the liability, if any, of
the husband, in that respect. As in the instant case
the witnesses came forward and claimed that the

incident occurred in their presence, so this Court
7

must be more conscious to ascertain the liability of
the appellant, so to avoid miscarriage of justice

7. _ The points for determination before this Court
are as to whether the incident occurred in the mode,
manner and at the stated time and as to whether the
complainant and the eyewitness succeeded in
establishing their presence on the spot, as to
whether there was altercation between the spouses
on the night of the incident, as to whether the matter
was reported in the mode, manner and at the stated
time; as to whether the dead body was shifted to the
hospital at the stated time and the report was made
to the local police, as to whether the prosecution
succeeded in convincing that it was the appellant
who killed the deceased. There is no denial to the
fact that the appellant is not the resident of the area
where the incident occurred as he hails from village
Mayar District Mardan and that it was his in-laws
who gave him the house to reside. Admittedly, in the
house in question no other person was residing, but
only the husband and the wife. The site plan depicts
that the house of the complainant is situated near to
the house of the deceased intervening by a vacant
plot. The complainant while reporting the matter
disclosed that on the night of incident he and his son

was busy in repair work, of the main gate of his
8

house; that in the meanwhile noise was heard from
the house of the deceased and they came to the
house, that no sooner did they enter the room, the
appellant/accused fired: at the deceased; that the
deceased after receiving firearm injuries died on the
spot; that the matter was reported to the local police
on the spot; that the co-accused was also present
with the appellant, duly armed with pistol; that after
firing at the deceased the accused decamped from
the spot. The eyewitness was examined as PW-4,
who supported the stance of the complainant and he
also disclosed that he verified the report of the
complainant. The witnesses were put to the test of
searching cross-examination, to test their veracity
and their availability on the spot. As this was for the
witnesses to convince of their presence on the spot,
so for this particular purpose, we went through the
statements of the complainant as well as of the
eyewitness. The complainant in his cross-
examination disclosed that on hearing noise they
entered the room and the moment they entered the
appellant fired at the deceased. This is surprising
that the complainant improved his Court statement
and disclosed that he and his son went to the house
to compromise the situation, but he could not. This

is for the prosecution to tell that on the night of
9

incident the complainant and the eyewitness was
busy in doing the repair work, even the record is
silent in that respect, but when the investigating
officer was asked regarding this fact, he disclosed
that the complainant and his son were repairing the
gate of the house of the deceased. As the site plan
was prepared on the instance of the complainant, so
we went through the same, which depicts that the
time of incident the deceased was sitting in the bed
and that she was fired at. The peaceful sitting of the
deceased in the bed at the time of quarrel is a
circumstance that disturbs the judicial mind of this
Court and the same belies the stance of the
complainant. The presence of the complainant and
the eyewitness is lacking confidence, as the
complainant in his Court statement made dishonest
improvements, while reporting the matter the
complainant did not disclose that they heard the hot
talks and they entered the house to bring the parties
at ease, rather the factum of compromise was
introduced by the complainant when he appeared
before the trial Court. The complainant in his Court
statement disclosed that the altercation between the
two took two minutes and thereafter the appellant
fired at the deceased. Had there been an

altercation, then instead of waiting for arrival of the
10

complainant to ease the situation, the appellant
would have killed the deceased at the earliest.
When the altercation did not continue for a good
length of time, then what brought the co-accused to
the house and for what purpose. As admittedly the
appellant is the resident of village Serai Mayar
District Mardan, so naturally the co-accused would
be living in his house at Mayar and his presence at
the time of incident, is a factor which the prosecution
could not explain. This is astonishing that if the
death occurred because of timely altercation, then
why the co-accused came duly armed and that why
he facilitated the appellant in killing the deceased.
Neither the complainant could bring on record
evidence of sharing the intention, nor the
investigating officer could collect evidence in that
respect.

8. The site plan depicts that the unfortunate
incident occurred inside the room, where the
deceased was sitting on the bed at point No.1 and
the appellant was standing at point No.2 whereas
the co-accused at point No.3. The very site plan
depicts that the complainant was standing at point
No.4 and the eyewitness at point No.5. Had the
accused/appellant killed the deceased in the

presence of her real father, the father would not let
11

the accused go. The complainant and the witness
were standing in front of the door of the room and
they had the opportunity to close the door from
outside, but neither resisted, nor made efforts to
catch hold of the accused. Realizing the danger the
complainant improved his statement, who disclosed
that after firing the accused cornered them at
gunpoint and because of fear they could not resist.
The complainant further disclosed that as they were
empty handed, so the accused succeeded in leaving
the spot. The statement of the complainant does not
appeal to a prudent mind, rather it was an attempt to
convince that the appellant could not be
overpowered, as they were duly armed. The arrival
of the complainant and the eyewitness by the time
when the accused fired at the deceased is a
circumstance which does not appeal to a prudent
mind and the witnesses are chance witnesses. The
complainant was asked regarding the presence of
the appellant in the house on the day of incident,
who disclosed that right from the morning till evening
he did not notice the presence of the appellant in the
house. When the complainant was confirmed that
right from the morning till evening the appellant was
not available in the house, then what led to the

altercation between the two and that at what time.
12

The eyewitness also appeared before the trial Court,
who was examined and even he made dishonest
improvements. The status of the witnesses and the
manner in which they attracted to the spot are the
circumstances which the prosecution failed to
convince. The dishonest improvements have never
been permitted by the Apex Court and such
improvements discredit the credibility of a witness,
whose testimony then can hardly be taken into
consideration. As is held in case titled “Muhammad
Munsha Vs The State” (2018 SCMR 772), which

reads as follows:-

“Once the Court comes to the
conclusion that the eye-witnesses
had made dishonest improvements in
their statements then it is not safe to
place reliance on their statements. It
is also settled by this Court that
whenever a witness made dishonest
improvement in his version in order
to bring his case in line with the
medical evidence or in order to
strengthen the prosecution case then
his testimony is not worthy of
credence. The witnesses in this case
have also made dishonest
improvement in order to bring the
case in line with the medical evidence
(as observed by the learned High
Court), in that eventuality conviction
was not sustainable on the testimony
of the said witnesses.”

9. The matter was reported on the spot when
the local police arrived. {t is interesting to note that
the incident occurred at 22:00 hours, whereas the
matter was reported at 23:30 hours to the local

police when they attracted to the spot. It is
13

interesting to note that. the scribe received
information at 22:00 hours and reached to the spot
within 10/15 minutes, but the report was made at
23:30 hours. This is for the prosecution to tell that
when the police arrived to the spot at 22:15 hours,
then why the report was delayed till 23:30. The
scribe was examined as PW-2, who stated that
during the days of occurrence he was attached to
Police Station Sheikh Maltoon, Mardan; that on the
night of occurrence he received information
regarding the death of the deceased; that on
receiving information he came to the spot house
where the dead body was lying and the complainant
alongwith the eyewitness was present; that the
complainant reported the matter at 23:30 hours
regarding the occurrence; that after drafting the
murasila he prepared the injury sheet Ex.PW2/1 and
inquest report Ex.PW2/2 and sent the dead body of
the deceased to the hospital for postmortem
examination. This witness was cross-examined
where he disclosed that he received information at
22:00 hours and that he reached to the spot within
10/15 minutes, after receiving the information. The
witness further disclosed that the report was made
at 23:30 hours and it took some 20 (twenty) minutes

in preparation of injury sheet and inquest report. The
14

witness further explained that after doing the needful
the Ambulance was called and the dead body was
sent to the hospital at 00:30 hours, from the spot.
The statement of the witness has surprised us that
when the information was received at 22:00 hours
and that when he reached to the spot at 22:15 hours
and when the complainant was available on the
spot, then why the report was not made. This aspect
of the case cannot be ignored, rather it has
damaged the prosecution case beyond repair. When
the statement of the scribe is taken into
consideration it leaves no ambiguity that till reporting
the matter the complainant was not sure regarding
the involvement of the appellant in killing the
deceased, rather it was after consultation and
deliberation that the appellant and the co-accused
were charged. The matter does end at here, rather
the investigating officer succeeded in collecting a
chit from the hospital where the time of arrival of the
dead body was shown at 11:20 PM and the same
was duly exhibited. This is for the prosecution to tell
that when the report was made at 23:30 hours and
when the dead body was sent to the hospital i.e.
00:30 hours, then how the dead body was received
in the emergency ward of the Mardan Medical

Complex at 11:20 PM. The doctor was examined as
15

PW-5 who stated that on 02.05.2019 at 11:30 PM
the postmortem on the dead body of the deceased
was conducted. The doctor was cross-examined on
material aspects of the case where she disclosed
that in the column of death the time of death
mentioned as 10:15 PM and that she started the
postmortem examination at 11:30 PM which took
her 30 minutes to complete. When the scribe
confirmed the availability of the dead body on the
spot at 00:30 hours, then how the same was
received in the emergency room of the hospital at
11:20 PM, then how the autopsy on the dead body
of deceased was carried on at 11:30 PM. When the
Statement of the witnesses are taken into
consideration no ambiguity is left that the witnesses
tried to bring harmony in the time of report, the time
the dead body was picked up and the time the
postmortem examination was carried out, but they
did not succeed to reconcile the same and their this
attempt has damaged the prosecution.

10. | Wecannot forget that according to the scribe
he received information, regarding the death of the
deceased, at 22:00 hours and he reached to the
spot at 22:15 hours and kept waiting till the matter
was reported at 23:30 hours. It is interesting to note

that why the matter was not reported when the
. 16
police arrived and when the complainant was
available. The witnesses failed to answer that why
the matter was not reported at the earliest and that
what explanation they tendered. The record is silent
regarding any explanation in that respect and even
the record is silent that who informed the police and
that why the dead body was not shifted to the
hospital soon after the incident. The inordinate delay
in reporting the matter can be interpreted in no other
manner, but that the report was made after
consultation and deliberation. Once it is established
on record that the matter was willfully delayed to be
reported, then no other inference can be drawn but
that preliminary investigation was made, so that the
attendance of the witnesses could be procured.
Similar circumstances are held by the august court
in case titled “RIAZ and another Versus The
STATE and another”, (2022 P Cr. L J 1070), which

is reproduced herein below:-

“It appears that police recorded the
report after conducting preliminary
investigation and the complainant
nominated the present appellants after
consultation and deliberation. Our this
apprehension is further substantiated
by duration of death of two hours as
mentioned by the doctor in the
postmortem report. On calculating the
said duration of death of the deceased
from the time of postmortem i.e 12:50
p.m., the occurrence must have taken
place at 10:50 am. which has
dishonestly been suppressed by
prosecution.”
17

41. The complainant could not convince that,
when the acquitted co-accused instigated the
appellant and that for what purpose, as admittedly
the appellant was residing in the house of the
complainant, situated near the house of the parents
of the deceased and the co-accused was residing in
his village at Serai Mayar District Mardan. Neither
the complainant could tell that the co-accused was
residing with the appellant in the same house, nor
the investigating officer could bring on record
anything in that respect. When the record is silent on
this particular aspect of the case, this Court is
inclined to hold that the appellant and the deceased
were living alone in the spot house. This is for the
witnesses to tell that how they came to know
regarding the consultation between the accused and
that what led the acquitted co-accused to help in
killing the deceased, but the witnesses could not
explain.

12. The doctor failed to tell that whether the
deceased committed suicide or that she was killed.
The attending circumstances of the present case,
leads this Court nowhere, but to hold that the
prosecution right from the beginning till the end,
concealed the real facts. The suppression of facts

on the part of the complainant is the circumstance

“18

which helps the accused. It was submitted that when
the doctor failed to observe charring marks, then no
other inference can be drawn, but the one that it was
the appellant who killed the deceased. Once the
witnesses claimed their presence at the spot and
once it was brought on record that the deceased lost
her life in their immediate presence, then in that
eventuality when the witnesses failed to establish
their presence on the spot, then the appellant
cannot be held responsible for the death of the
deceased. The question that whether the deceased
committed suicide or she was killed by the appellant
will hardly succeed as once the prosecution
evidence is disbelieved then the involvement of the
appellant in the death of the decease could not be
proved and when such is the state of affairs then the
absence or presence of the charring marks would
hardly matter. If we accept that there were no
charring marks even then the appellant cannot be
held responsible for the death of the deceased as to
his extent the prosecution failed to prove its case.
Once the prosecution failed to succeed then the
burden never shifts to the appellant and the
appellant is not supposed to explain the events
which led to the death of the deceased. Had the

witnesses not claimed the witness of occurrence,
19

then under all circumstances the appellant was
responsible to prove his innocence, but it was the
failure of the witnesses which absolved the appellant
from his this liability. The attending circumstances of
the present case leads this Court nowhere but to
hold that the witnesses failed to convince the
involvement of the appellant and the delayed report
confirmed that the matter was reported after
consultation and deliberation. As the prosecution
failed to prove its case against the appellant, so in
the attending circumstances of the present case the
appellant was not suppose to convince regarding his
innocence, as in this particular case the burden to
prove his innocence was never shifted to the
appellant, as it was the complainant who happily
accepted the burden and then the witnesses were
supposed to prove their case to the hilt against the
appellant. The similar circumstance came before the
Apex Court in case titled “NAZIR AHMAD Versus
The STATE”, (2018 S C M R 787), which reads as

follows:-

“it has been argued by the learned
Deputy Prosecutor-General, Punjab
appearing for the State that the
deceased in this case was a
vulnerable dependent of the appellant
and, thus, by virtue of the law
declared by this Court in the cases of
Saeed Ahmed v. The State (2015
SCMR 710) and Arshad Mehmood v.
The State (2005 SCMR 1524) some
part of the onus had shifted to the
appellant to explain the
20

circumstances in which his wife had
died an unnatural death in his house
during the fateful night which part of
the onus had not been discharged by
the appellant. We have attended to
this aspect of the case with care and
have found that when every other
Piece of evidence relied upon by the
prosecution has been found by us to
be utterly unreliable then the
appellant could not be convicted for
the alleged murder simply on the
basis of a supposition. The principle
enunciated in the above mentioned
cases of Saeed Ahmed v. The State
(2015 SCMR 710) and Arshad
Mehmood v. The State (2005 SCMR
1524) was explained further in the
cases of Nasrullah alias Nasro v. The
State (2017 SCMR 724) and Asad
Khan v. The State (PLD 2017 SC 681)
wherein it had been clarified that the
above mentioned shifting of some
part of the onus to the accused may
not be relevant in a case where the
entire case of the prosecution itself is
not reliable .and where the
prosecution fails to produce any
believable evidence. It is trite that in
all such cases the initial onus of proof
always lies upon the prosecution and
if the prosecution fails to adduce
reliable evidence in support of its own
case then the accused person cannot
be convicted merely on the basis of
lack of discharge of some part of the
onus on him.”

13. The cumulative effect of what has been stated
above, leads this Court nowhere but to hold that the
prosecution could not succeed in bringing home guilt
against the appellant and that the impugned
judgment is suffering from errors and inherent
defects, which calls for interference. Resultantly, we
allow the instant criminal appeal and set aside the
judgment impugned and acquit the appellant from

the charges leveled against him. He is in custody,
21

be released forthwith if not required to be detained
in any other case.

14. As the appeal against conviction has
succeeded and the impugned judgment is set-aside
which led to the acquittal of the appellant, so the
instant criminal revision has lost its utility and the
same is dismissed as such.

15. Though against the acquittal of the co-accused
the connected criminal appeal bearing No.181-
P/2023 has been instituted, but once the
convict/appellant succeeded in making out a case
for indulgence and once he has been acquitted of
the charge, then the instant criminal appeal has lost
its utility, the same is dismissed as such.
