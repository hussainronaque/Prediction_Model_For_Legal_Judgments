IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Through the instant

Criminal Revision Petition, the petitioners have called in

question the impugned order dated 17.05.2015 rendered

by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu,

whereby application for shifting the statements of PWs,

i.e. Mir Qad Ayaz FC 949 and Muhammad Akbar Khan

SHO being dead while that of complainant/respondent

petitioner under Section 512, Cr.P.C. and one other

acquitted co-accused Hamimullah, was accepted.

2. Allegedly, accused/petitioner alongwith

acquitted co-accused Hameenullah and another were

charged in case FIR No.133 dated 10/11/1998 under

sections 302/324/34 PPC Police station Mirian.

3. During trial of present accused/petitioner,

after recording some of the prosecution witnesses, PW

Magsood through his counsel submitted application for

shifting statements of the PWs Mir Qad Ayaz 949,

Muhammad Akbar SHO and complainant Sabir Khan,

whose statements had already been recorded during trial

of acquitted co-accused Hameenullah, on the grounds

that police witnesses were dead while complainant of the

case was proclaimed offender in another criminal case.

Learned counsel for petitioner/accused had got no

objection on transfer of statements of police officials,

mentioned above, while raised objection on shifting of

statement of complainant. Learned trial Court, thereafter,

giving opportunity of hearing to both the parties, on the

application mentioned above, accepted the same and

made direction for  shifting/transfer of previous

statements of all the three PWs, to be placed on record of

trial against the petitioner, vide its order dated

17.02.2014, impugned herein.

4. Learned counsel for petitioner contended

that the impugned judgment is against law and facts on

record, hence liable to be set aside; that the complainant

Sabir Khan, whose statement was recorded during course

of previous trial in the same case FIR, is now absconder

in a number of criminal cases vide FIRs Nos.42, 44, 104,

122 lodged against him under sections 302, 324, 34 PPC

and 13 A.O of Police station Mirian, Bannu and as such

fugitive of law, loses some of his normal rights conferred

upon him by any substantive or procedural law, but

learned trial court, has not appreciated this aspect of the

case, which would seriously prejudice the trial of the case

against the petitioner/accused on one hand while on the

other hand, would deprive the petitioner therefrom his

legal right to cross examine the witness, whose statement

TRIAL MODE - a valid license will remove this message. See the keywords property of this PDF for more information.

would have to be brought under consideration by learned

trial Court, against the petitioner/accused.

5. On the other hand, learned counsel for

respondent supported the impugned judgment in view of

the judgments of this court rendered in “Amjad Ali and

another Vs The state and another” (2013 P.Cr.L.J 282)

and “Sohail Vs. The state and another” (PLD 2014

Peshawar 189) and argued that the impugned judgment

of learned trial Court is based on correct and proper

appreciation of law, could not be interfered with by this

Court, as no illegality or irregularity was pointed out by

learned counsel for petitioner in the impugned judgment.

6. We have heard learned counsel for parties

and learned A.A.G on behalf of State in light of law and

facts on record.

7. The proposition of law, confronted herein is,

as to whether the statement of a witness, who had

absconded in other criminal cases, and whose attendance

was not possible to record his evidence, his previous

statement could be transposed/transferred in the

subsequent trial against an accused, who remained itself
fugitive of law in previous trial under the same FIR, held
against him under Section 512, Cr.P.C.
8. It would not be out of context to reproduce
the relevant law, in this regard, which authorizes the
court to proceed against an accused, in his absence and
the effect of such statement of a witness recorded his
absence under section 512 Cr.P.C. which reads as;

512. Record of evidence in absence of
accused. (1) If it is proved that an accused
person has absconded, and that there is no
immediate prospect of arresting him the
Court competent to try or (send for trial to
the Court of Sessions or High Court) such
person for the offence complained of may,
in his absence, examine the witnesses (if
any) produced on behalf of the prosecution,
and record their depositions. Any such
deposition may, on the arrest of such
person, be given in evidence against him on
the inquiry into, or trial for the offence with
which he is charged, if the deponent is dead
or incapable of giving evidence or his
attendance cannot be procured without an
amount of delay, expense or inconvenience
which, under the circumstances of the case,

would be unreasonable”

9. The provision contained in section 512

Cr.P.C , authorizes the court of Sessions or a High Court

to record the statement of a witness in absence of an

accused, who had gone into hiding and his presence

before the court is if it is proved that such an accused had

absconded and there is no immediate prospect of

arresting him, in order to preserve the evidence if during

subsequent trial, the attendance of such a witness could

not be procured without an amount of delay, or he is dead

or incapable of giving evidence.

10. The provision contained in section 512

Cr.P.C, not only empower the trial court to record

evidence of a witness in absence of the accused, who had

gone into hiding and such evidence, in case, the witness,

was not available in subsequent trial, on account of the

grounds mentioned in section 512 Cr.P.C, but also such

deposition could be given in evidence against the under

trial accused, however, section 512 Cr.P.C could be read,

in conjunction of Article 47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat

Order, 1984, which reads as,

47. Relevancy of certain evidence for
proving, in subsequent proceedings, the
truth of fact therein stated. Evidence given
by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or
before any person authorized by law to take
it is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a
subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later
state of the same judicial proceeding, the
truth of the facts which it states, when the
witness is dead or cannot be found, or is
incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out
of the way but the adverse party, of if his
presence cannot be obtained without an
amount of delay or expense which, under
the circumstances of the case, the Court
considers unreasonable;

Provided that; the proceeding was between
the same parties or their representatives-in-
interest; the adverse party in the first
proceeding had the right and opportunity to
cross-examine, the question in issue were
substantially the same in the first as in the

second proceeding.

11. So, keeping in view, the provision of Article

47 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, Order, 1984, a deposition of

a witness, would be relevant only in subsequent trial if

the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and

opportunity to cross examine, apart from other two

ingredients mentioned in Article 47 of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat, Order, 1984, is fulfilled.

12. In case in hand, the complainant namely

Sabir Khan had appeared as a witness in the previous

trial, against co-accused Hameemullah, but he was not

properly cross examined on account of compromise,

effected between the then accused and the complainant.

13. So, the question of admissibility of such a

statement of a witness, or otherwise, would be dealt with

by the learned trial court but, no legal restriction could be

placed, on transposing the statement of a witness

recorded in view of section 512 Cr.P.C. to subsequent

trial.

14. As there is no apprehension, that by mere

transposition of a deposition the accused would be

prejudice, while the attendance of the witness could not

be procured without an amount of delay, expense or

inconvenience which, under the attending facts and

circumstances of the case in hand, is unreasonable, where

prosecution had already completed its evidence, justice

demand, that the deposition of the absconding witness be

transferred in the case, in hand in view of section 512

Cr.P.C. to fulfill the requirements of law. However, as

discussed herein above in the light of the submission of

learned counsel for petitioner that, petitioner would be

deprived to cross examine the person, whose statement

would be used against him, is premature.

15. The evidentiary value of such deposition,

would be adjudged by the trial court in light of the

provision contained in article 47 of the Qaun-e-Shahadat,

Order, 1984 and the principle of law enunciated by

superior courts in this regard.

In case titled “Arbab Tasleem Vs. The

State” (PLD 2010 SC 642) the Apex Court has held as,

“Evidentiary value--- Statement of eye-
witness in the form of examination-in-chief,
though found legal and admissible in
evidence, yet its evidentiary value could not
be equated with such statement subject to
cross-examination; therefore for giving
weight to the statement of such witness, it
would have to be seen whether the

examination-in-chief intrinsically rang true

and whether or not same was supported by
circumstantial evidence---If such statement
was supported by independent evidence in
the shape of any circumstance’ or
corroborated by any source, if would be

good piece of evidence”.

16. Keeping in view the reasons given herein

above, this Revision petition fails on merit, dismissed

accordingly.
