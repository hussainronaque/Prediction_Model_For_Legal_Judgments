Cr.A. No.37-A of 2012

Date of hearing:

Petitioner

Respondents

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J. Appellant Khalid Khan
through the instant appeal has impugned the judgment
dated 15.02.2012 of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-III, Haripur, delivered in case FIR No.420 dated
27.09.2010 under Sections 302/452 PPC of Police Station
Kot Najibullah, District Haripur, whereby he has been
convicted and sentenced to death under Section 302(a)
PPC. He has also been convicted under Section 452 PPC
and sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment with
a fine of Rs.5000/- or in default to further undergo two
months S.I. The learned trial Court further directed him to
pay Rs.3,00,000/-, as compensation to the legal heirs of
the deceased under Section 544-A, Cr.P.C. or in default

thereof to further undergo simple imprisonment of six
months. Benefit under Section 382-B, Cr.P.C. has been
extended to him. The appellant has impugned his
conviction and sentence while the learned trial Court has
sent Murder Reference to this Court under Section 374
Cr.P.C. Both the matters are being decided through this

single judgment.

2- Brief facts of the case are that on
27.09.2010, Mst. Shakeela Bibi (PW-9) reported to Riasat
Khan, ASI (PW-15) in the emergency ward of Civil
Hospital, Haripur, to the effect that in the morning after
finishing her household work she had visited the house of
her elder daughter, namely, Mst. Tasleem Bibi. No sooner
than she left her daughter’s house, her cousin Mst. Akhtar
Bibi met her there and told that her nephew Khalid had
fired at her daughter Mst. Saira in her house. On this, Mst.
Shakeela Bibi rushed to her house where Ali Asghar Khan
(PW-10), her brother Shafique Ahmad (PW-11), Abdul
Jalil and Ali Zaman (both not produced) had reached there
after hearing the fire shot. They found the kitchen’s door
bolted from inside which, on knocking, was opened where
they saw Mst. Saira lying on floor of the kitchen in injured
condition while appellant Khalid was standing there
holding a pistol in his hand, who after opening the door,
succeeded in fleeing from the scene. Mst. Shakeela
charged her nephew Khalid for the gatl-i-amd of her

daughter Saira but disclosed no motive for the occurrence.
3- Appellant was arrested on 01.10.2010 and
after completion of the case investigation challan was put
in Court, which indicted him on 10.11.2010 for the
commission of offence to which he pleaded not guilty and
claimed trial. Prosecution in order to prove its case
produced 15 witnesses whereafter statement of the
accused under Section 342 Cr.P.C. was recorded. It is
pertinent to mention here that in his such statement the
appellant confessed his guilt. The learned trial Court after
conclusion of the trial found the appellant guilty of the
charge and while recording his conviction sentenced him

as mentioned in para No.1 of this judgment.

4- Learned counsel for the appellant
contended that there is no eyewitness to the occurrence
and case against the appellant is of no evidence; that there
was no motive for the appellant to commit the murder of
Mst. Saira; that the learned trial Court has illegally placed
reliance on the statement of the appellant recorded under
section 342 Cr.P.C. for recording his conviction and that
the prosecution purposely has not produced Mst. Akhtar
Bibi, who, as per FIR, had informed the complainant
about the occurrence; that no sanctity is attached to the
report of FSL, as the recoveries of crime empties and
pistol were effected on 27.09.2010 and 01.10.2010

respectively but were received in the Laboratory on
06.10.2010, and delay in sending the articles has not been
explained by the prosecution plausibly which fact has
made the recoveries doubtful and of no legal worth. At the
tail end of his arguments, learned counsel for the appellant
submitted that without prejudice to his case on merits, the
learned trial Court has erred in law by awarding capital
punishment to the appellant, therefore, the sentence be
reduced to imprisonment for life, as neither there was any
motive for the appellant to commit the crime nor there is
any evidence to show that what had happened before the
occurrence which prompted the appellant to fire at the

deceased.

5- As against the above, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned AAG for the State supported

the judgment of conviction and sentence.

6- We have heard learned counsel for the
parties and gone through the case record with their

assistance.

7- Perusal of the case record would show that
while appearing before the Court as PW-9 complainant of
the case, namely, Mst. Shakeela reported the awful act of
gatl-i-amd of her daughter within a short span of 35
minutes not only charging therein the appellant by name
as perpetrator of the offence but also cited in her report

two persons by name as eyewitnesses in whose presence
the kitchen’s door was opened and all of them saw there
the appellant standing with the deceased duly armed with
a pistol. Version of the complainant has been duly
corroborated by PW-10 Ali Asghar Khan, who deposed
before the Court that on hearing the fire shot, he had
rushed to the spot where complainant Shakeela Bibi and
PW Shafique were present. He further deposed that door
of the kitchen was closed from inside which was opened
on their knocking and then they saw appellant Khalid
Khan standing inside the kitchen, who was duly armed
with pistol and the deceased was lying on the kitchen’s
floor in injured condition. He further went on to depose
that the moment kitchen’s door was opened appellant
Khalid Khan made his escape good therefrom. Same is the
testimony of Shafique Ahmad, who appeared before the
court as PW-11. Complainant and the two aforesaid were
subjected to the test of cross-examination but nothing was
brought from their mouths, which could have shattered

their evidence.

8- Apart from the above, Lady Dr. Shagufta
Iltaf MWO, who had examined the deceased and
conducted autopsy, appeared before the Court as PW-8.
According to her report (Ex.PW8/1) she had found the
following injuries on the person of the victim:-

1. An entry wound with brain matter and profuse

bleeding at left teporo-perital area with
fracture bone with blackening measuring 2 x 2
cm.

2. An exit wound measuring 3 x 3” with brain
matter coming out with profuse bleeding zat
right occipital area 1% ” away from right

ear, behind.

9- Evidence furnished by the Lady Doctor
fully corroborates the complainant’s version. Investigating
Officer of the case, namely, Zarbat Khan S.I. appeared
before the Court as PW-14. He deposed that on the
pointation of complainant and other witnesses, he had
prepared the site plan (Ex.PW14/1) and recovered from
the spot four empties of .30 bore pistol (Ex.P2) besides
live 13 bullets of .30 bore (Ex.P3) and two spent bullets
(Ex.P4). According to the testimony of this witness, he
had arrested the appellant on 01.10.2010 vide his card of
arrest Ex.PW14/4. He has further deposed before the
Court that on arrest, the appellant led police party to the
fields of one Safdar Zaman and pointed out a place where
he had concealed the crime weapon i.e. 30 bore pistol,
which was recovered vide recovery memo Ex.PW13/1. It
is worth to mention that ibid recovery has been witnessed
by an independent person of the locality, namely, Saleem
Khan, who appeared before the Court as PW-13 and duly
supported the factum of recovery. It is noteworthy that the
recovered pistol and empties were sent to Forensic

Science Laboratory for ascertaining whether the empties
have been fired from the pistol or not? The report of FSL

(Ex.14/9) is positive.

10- Above resume of the prosecution evidence
shows that the version given by the complainant and PWs
10 & 11 is fully corroborated by circumstantial aspects of
the case. No doubt, there is no eyewitness to the act of
firing made by the appellant at the deceased but the
evidence furnished by complainant, PW-10 and PW-11, as
has been discussed above, coupled with the recoveries of
crime empties from the spot and the crime pistol on
pointation of the appellant fully support the prosecution
case and connect the appellant with commission of the
offence he is charged with. Presence of the appellant, just
after the occurrence, duly armed with pistol in the kitchen,
where the deceased was lying in the pool of blood
undoubtedly shows his clear nexus with murder of the

deceased.

11- In addition to the evidence so furnished by
the prosecution on 18.01.2012, the appellant himself had
moved an application before the learned trial Court for
pleading his guilt and thereafter on 23.01.2012, on
conclusion of the prosecution evidence, appellant recorded
his statement under Section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein he
confessed his guilt. In his such statement, he admitted the

report lodged against him by the complainant as correct.
Pronounced question put to the appellant is question No.3,

which alongwith its answer is reproduced as under:-

12-

“ Q-3. It is in the evidence that you on
27.09.2010 at about 09.00 AM trespassed
into the house of complainant situated in
village Bhera after having made
preparation for causing injuries to Mst.
Saira (deceased) daughter of complainant
while duly armed with pistol. What do you
say about it?”

Ans: “It is correct”.

It would not be out of place to mention

that in order to know about the appellant’s health

condition,

this Court on 09.05.2012 ordered for

production of the appellant from Jail and he was so

produced before the Court on 12.09.2012, on which this

Court passed the following order:-

13-

condition of the appellant, this Court had referred him to

“Khalid Khan was made to enter the Court
without his handcuffs and interviewed by
the Court. He insisted that he had
committed the offence and was prepared
for the consequences thereof. His
demeanor was natural and he realized the
consequences of his present statement. He
also brought to the attention of the Court
that his family members had insisted upon
him to change his stance, which had

declined”.

To get further satisfaction qua health
the Standing Medical Board for his medical check-up
keeping in view the application submitted by him before
the learned trial Court for pleading his guilt and the
answers given by him to the questions put to him under
Section 342, Cr.P.C. The standing medical board after his

thorough medical check up reported as under:-

“The Standing Medical Board
comprising the following members
assembled in the office of the Medical
Superintendent Police / Services, Hospital,
Peshawar to examine accused Khalid
Khan s/o Muhammad Younis.

The Standing Medical Board is of
the opinion that the accused after a period
of observation and repeated assessment in
detention unit of Central Prison Peshawar.
The Standing Medical Board is of the
opinion that at the moment he has no
mental illness. He talks rationally,
coherently. He does not exhibit any
delusion or hallucinations. He understand
the nature of his crime, it consequences
court proceedings and is therefore fit to

pleased in the court of law”.
14- We have re-appraised the ocular and
circumstantial evidence of the case and the 342 Cr.P.C.
statement of the appellant with care and caution. From
perusal of the entire case record, it appears to us that the
prosecution has successfully proved its case against the

appellant through worth reliable and confidence inspiring
10

evidence. Complainant of the case and PWs 10 & 11 are
consistent with each other on all material aspects of the
case. The ocular account is fully supported by medical
evidence, site plan, recovery of crime empties and the

crime pistol.

15- It was vehemently argued by learned
counsel for the appellant that awarding the sentence of
death as gisas under Section 302(a) PPC to the appellant
by learned trial Court was not justified as no proof of
qisas was available on the case file. Ibid contention of the
learned counsel is of no help to him, as the appellant
himself made a voluntary and true confession of his guilt
before the Court. According to section 304(1)(a) PPC
when an accused makes before a Court competent to try
the offence a voluntary and true confession of commission
of the offence with which he is charged then under section
302(a) PPC the sentence of committing gqatl-i-amd shall
be death as gisas. Now the question is whether statement
made by an accused under section 342 Cr.P.C. is a
confession? Answer to this question is in yes. The
honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in a judgment
reported in 2015 SCMR 423 has held that “statement of an
accused recorded under Section 342 Cr.P.C. is more
reliable than compared to the statement recorded under
section 164 Cr.P.C.” Therefore, it can safely be held that

statement recorded by an accused under Section 342
11

Cr.P.C. is a confession as envisaged under section
302(1)(a) PPC and if that statement is corroborated by
ocular and circumstantial evidence of the case then the
Court can proceed to convict and sentence the accused
under section 302(1)(a) PPC. Not only the appellant had
admitted his guilt in his 342 Cr.P.C. statement but prior to
that on 18.01.2012, he had moved an application to the
trial Court for recording his guilt. Furthermore, before this
Court on 12.09.2012, as stated earlier, the appellant stuck

with what he had admitted in his 342 Cr.P.C. statement.

16- For the above reasons, awarding of the
normal penalty of death by the trial Court to the appellant

under Section 302(a) PPC is quite legal.

17- Submission of the learned counsel that as
the crime empties and crime pistol were received by FSL
on 06.10.2010, therefore, same has no legal worth too is
of no help to the appellant, as delay per se in sending
crime weapon and crime empties to FSL shall not
overweigh the ocular evidence found in line and supported
by the medical evidence. Wisdom is derived from a
judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan

reported in 2010 SCMR 1752.

18- Learned counsel for the appellant had also
argued that as no motive has been assigned to the

appellant for commission of the offence, therefore,
12

awarding of capital punishment to him does not
commensurate with his act. Suffice it to say that
weakness, insufficiency or even absence of any motive in
murder cases cannot be considered as a mitigating
circumstance for awarding lesser punishment to an
accused, therefore, alternate submission of learned
counsel for the appellant for converting the death penalty
into imprisonment for life is turned down. Reliance is

placed on 2003 SCMR 747.

19- From the foregoing discussion, it is clear
that the prosecution has successfully proved its case
against the appellant beyond any shadow of doubt and, as
such, the learned trial Court has rightly convicted and
sentenced him for the gatl-i-amd of Mst. Saira through the
impugned judgment to which no exception could be taken
by this Court. Consequently, the instant criminal appeal,
being bereft of any merit, is hereby dismissed. Murder
Reference stands answered in affirmative.

Announced.
