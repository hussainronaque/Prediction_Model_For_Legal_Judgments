QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Hasnain Obaid,

petitioner, assailed order of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-lll, Nowshera, dated
10.01.2018, through the instant criminal

revision under Section 439 Cr.PC, whereby
his application under Section 428 Cr.PC for
further evidence was dismissed.

2. The facts leading to filing of the instant
criminal revision, as narrated in the revision
petition, briefly stated, are that the petitioner
was charged for dishonestly issuing cheque
for payment of Rs.6800000/- to the
complainant/respondent No.1, Asif Shakoor,
vide FIR No.237 dated 06.08.2014 under
Section 489-F P.S  Nowshera _ Canitt,
Nowshera; and on conclusion of trial in the
trial Court, he was awarded punishment of
imprisonment for three years and fine of
Rs.30,000/-, with benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.PC; by the learned Judicial Magistrate-lll,
Nowshera. According to the petitioner, he had
already completed his two years. term,
approximately, and is on bail from the Court of
Learned ASJ-III, Nowshera, in appeal pending
before the said Court. The petitioner claimed
that he was psychological patient and that the
cheque in question for Rs.6800000/- had

fraudulently been obtained from him, and
further that he had already paid Rs.2700000/-
to the complainant as against Rs.2400000/-
due against him. The petitioner further
claimed that the said record could not be
placed on the file as he was in jail and was
having no access to the same, so was
handicapped. In order to place the said record
on appeal file, an application under Section
428 Cr.PC was submitted to the appellate
Court, but his request was not acceded to by
the appellate Court; hence the instant revision
petition.

3. The impugned order dated 10.01.2018
of the learned appellate Court/ASJ-III,
Nowshera, would show that the Court
observed that the alleged cheque was for
Rs.6800000/- and that even if the
appellant/petitioner proved payment of
Rs.2700000/-, even then a huge amount of
Rs.4100000/- would remain unpaid, and that
the proceedings before the Court were not
civil proceedings to prove as to how much

amount was unpaid and how much paid, but
in criminal proceedings it was to be seen that
whether the offence had been committed or
not, “though the amount may be a small
amount”. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge further observed that under the
provision of Section 428 Cr.PC, the appellate
Court could take further evidence, however,
there was no justifiable reason to allow the
appellant to produce evidence. The learned
appellate Court concluded that at the stage of
statement of the accused, during trial, the
appellant was provided opportunity to produce
defence evidence but he “denied”.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner, learned counsel for respondent
No.1 and learned Assistant Advocate General
for the State heard; and record perused.

5. Although, the petitioner had neither
placed on file copy of judgment of the learned
trial Court/Judicial Magistrate-IIl, Nowshera,
nor copy of the appeal preferred by him
against the judgment of the learned trial Court,

for proper assistance of the Court in order to
arrive at a just and fair conclusion; and even
during the course of arguments the main
stress of the learned counsel for the petitioner
was on the mental ill health of the petitioner;
which, indeed, had never been pleaded as a
defence either in the criminal case under
discussion or in the civil suit by respondent
No.1 against the petitioner for recovery of
Rs.6800000/-, as is evident from written
statement in the civil suit by the
petitioner/defendant and also his statement
under Section 342 Cr.PC_ in the criminal
proceedings against him, subsequently
brought on record by respondent No.1
besides affidavit of the petitioner and another
FIR under the same Section i.e.489-F PPC
registered in P.S Gulgasht Multan vide FIR
No.456 of 2015; yet during his statement
under Section 342 Cr.PC recorded on
11.04.2017, the petitioner was _ specifically
asked whether he wanted to produce any
defence evidence, and his answer to the

question was “No”. It was only after his
conviction in the case and during pendency of
his appeal against the conviction and
sentences awarded to him that, apparently as
an after-thought, he moved application for
recording “further evidence” while raising
the plea of his being a psychological patient.

6. No doubt, Section 428 Cr.PC, where-
under application has been moved by the
petitioner for “recording further evidence or
direct to be taken’, empowers an appellate
Court to take further evidence or direct to be
taken, in its discretion; but the question here is
that whether the appellate Court could,
nevertheless, take further evidence or direct to
be taken on application of an
appellantfaccused who was provided an
opportunity to produce his defence evidence,
but refused to do so; and later on, as an after-
thought after his conviction in the case, moved
application for recording further evidence;
which was, obviously, out of question, when
the appellant/accused had refused to ‘avail

the opportunity’ of recording ‘defence
evidence’ so as to invoke the jurisdiction of
the appellate Court for taking ‘further
evidence’. Needless to say that for recording
“further evidence”, as the word further
would suggest, earlier recording of evidence
by a party would be an essential pre-requisite,
which is non-existent in the instant case, as
the petitioner did not avail the opportunity of
recording his defence evidence during trial
proceedings.

7. As such, there is no substance in the
criminal revision petition under Section 439

Cr.PC, which is dismissed, accordingly.

Announced.
