QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- This Criminal
Appeal by convict-appellant, Basit son of Mir
Aftab, resident of Sheikh Jana, Tehsil and
District Swabi, is directed against the judgment

and order dated 02.12.2016 of learned
Additional Sessions Judge-I, Swabi, whereby,
the appellant was awarded the penalty of death
as Tazir and also to pay Rs.2000000/- to the
legal heirs of deceased, Zard Ali, under Section
302 (b) PPC; and also against conviction of the
appellant under Section 324 PPC and penalty of
seven years R.I with fine of Rs.50,000/- or in
default to six months S.J, while extending
benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC to the convict-
appellant.

2. The aforementioned convictions and
sentences were awarded to the  convict-
appellant in case vide FIR No.169 dated
04.07.2014 under Sections 302/324/34 PPC
registered in Police Station Purmoli, Swabi, on
the report of complainant, Asghar Jan,
(incorrectly recorded as Asghar Jang in the FIR)
son of Mumtaz Bacha, resident of Sheikh Jana,
District Swabi, who reported to the police in
injured condition in Civil Hospital Kalo Khan
about the qatl-i-amd of Zard Ali and firearm

injuries to him by the convict-appellant, Basit,
and absconding co-accused and his brother
Ajmal, his father Mir Aftab and Jamal Sher son
of Bahadar when they, allegedly, suddenly
emerged at the scene of occurrence situated in
the limits of village Shewa duly armed with
deadly weapons, and opened firing at him,
deceased Zard Ali and their companion and
brother of deceased namely Liaqat Ali son of
Haider Khan, while they were on their way
back from village Shewa. The motive for the
occurrence was cited as dispute over women
folk. The FIR was registered on the basis of
murasila, which was drafted by Javed Iqbal ASI,
who also prepared inquest report of deceased
Zard_ Ali, injury sheet of the injured
complainant, and referred both the deceased
and the injured-complainant for Postmortem
examination and medical examination,
respectively.

3. The injury sheet of the injured-
complainant showed one firearm entry wound

about %4 x % inch in size on the right shoulder
with corresponding exit wound about 01 x 01
inch in size on posterior-lateral aspect of right
side (Posterior auxiliary line). The Medical
Officer, examining the injured complainant, also
found another firearm entry wound about %4 x
Y, inch in size on the lateral aspect of right
thigh, with no corresponding wound. Likewise,
the postmortem examination of deceased Zard
Ali revealed a fire arm entry wound about % x
Â¥% inch in size on the right side frontal bone,
with corresponding exit wound about 03 x 03
inch in size on the right side skull, fracturing
temporal bone, and brain matter lying outside.
Another firearm entry wound about % x % inch
in size lateral aspect of (Lt) thigh, with
corresponding exit wound about 01 X 01 inch in
size on the medial aspect of (Lt) thigh,

fracturing (Lt) thigh.

4. The 1.0, Shams Zaman (PW10), then,
proceeded to the spot, conducted spot
inspection, during which, he secured blood

stained earth from the place assigned to
deceased Zard Ali in the site plan, and also
recovered 15 empty shells of 7.62 bore, giving
smell of fresh discharge lying in scattered
condition, on the spot, besides a cell phone
(Nokia) from the place assigned in the site plan
to absconding accused Ajmal, and a charger of
Kalashnikov 7.62 bore containing 4 rounds of
7.62 bore from the same place of absconding
accused Ajmal; and also prepared the site plan.
The blood stained garments of the deceased as
well as injured complainant were also received
by the I.0 from the Medical Officer; and the I.0
dispatched the blood stained earth along with
blood stained garments of the deceased as well
as the injured complainant to the FSL,
Peshawar, and received report there-from in
the affirmative. During investigation, the I.0
also recorded statements of the PWs, and
submitted challan under section 512 Cr.PC
against the accused after fulfilling the
requirements of warrants under Section 204

Cr.P.C and proclamation under Section 87
Cr.P.C. After arrest of the convict-appellant, by
the local police of P.S Kalu Khan in case vide
FIRs No. 731 and 724, he was formally arrested
by the I.0 and supplementary challan was, then,
submitted against him.

5. After compliance with provision of
Section 265-C Cr.P.C, formal charge was framed
against the appellant under Sections 302, 324,
337-F (III) PPC read with Section 34 PPC, to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

6. After examination of Ali Gohar DFC
(SW.1) with regard to absconsion of co-accused
Ajmal, Mir Aftab and Jamal Sher, and
proceeding to record evidence in their absence
within the meaning of Section 512 Cr.P.C, the
learned trial Court examined prosecution
witnesses comprising as many as ten PWs, as
under:-

i. Ali Gohar, DFC (PW1) deposed about
abscondence of accused facing trial.

ii. Fawad Ali, ASI (PW2) was recorder of FIR
(EXPA) on the strength of murasila.

iii. Jawad Iqbal, ASI (PW3) deposed to have

scribed murasila EX.PA/1 incorporating
vi.

vii.

therein whatever was_ stated by
complainant. He also prepared injury
sheet and inquest report EXPW3/1,
EXPW3/2 and EXPW3/3.

Dr. Fazal Hadi, M.O (PW4) deposed that
he had conducted autopsy on dead body
of Zard Ali on 04.07.2016 and recorded
Postmortem report EXPM. On the same
date, he stated to have also examined the
injured Asghar Jan and recorded MLR
EXPW4/1.

Iftikhar Ali (PW5) was identifier of dead
body of deceased before Police as well as
Doctor.

Sultan Mehmood Inspector/SHO (PW6)
deposed that he had filed report under
section 512 Cr.P.C against the accused. He
further stated to have, after arrest of
present accused, submitted
supplementary report against him.

Syed Behramand (PW7) was witness of
recovery memos EXPC, EXPC/1, EXPC/2,
EXPC/3 and EXPC/4 vide which the I.0 in
his presence taken into possession blood
stained earth from the place of
occurrence, 15 empties of 7.62 bore, one
set of cell phone (Nokia) of the accused
Ajmal, Kalashnikov with 4 live rounds and

blood stained clothes of the deceased.
viii. Asghar Jan/complainant, while appearing
as PW.8 narrated the entire eye account
of the episode as reflected in murasila
EXPA/1.

ix. Liaqat Ali (PW9) was another eye witness
of the occurrence who also narrated the
same story as mentioned in the FIR.

x. Shams Zaman SI, examined as PW10, gave
a account of complete investigation

conducted in the case by him.

7. After prosecution closed its evidence,
statement of the  convict-appellant was
recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC, wherein, he
not only refuted allegations of the prosecution
against him, but also expressed his desire to
produce defence and to appear as his own
witness on oath in rebuttal of charges of
prosecution. The two defence witnesses i.e.
Hidayatullah (DW.1) and Rizwanullah (DW.2)
supported plea of alibi raised by the convict-
appellant in his statement under Section 340
(2) Cr.PC.

8. Thereafter, the learned trial Court heard

arguments of learned defence counsel, learned
SPP for State assisted by learned counsel for
complainant and rendered the impugned
judgment dated 02.12.2016, whereby, while
convicting the appellant, the learned Court
awarded him the punishment of seven years R.I
and fine of Rs.50,000/- and in default of
payment of fine S.J for six months for his
attempting at the life of Asghar
Jan/complainant under Section 324 PPC. The
appellant was also convicted under Section 302
(b) PPC and sentenced to the penalty of death as
Tazir for causing the death of Zard Ali. The
appellant was ordered to be hanged by the neck
till he was dead i.e. till MO in presence of
Judicial Magistrate on duty in Jail confirms the
convict dead. The learned Court held the
appellant also liable to pay compensation under
Seciton 544-A Cr.PC to the tune of
Rs.20,00000/- (twenty Lac) to the legal heirs of
deceased (Zard Ali), with further direction that
the compensation shall be recoverable from his

property as arrears of land revenue and that
owing to want of property, he shall further
suffer S.I for six months. The benefit of
Section382-B Cr.PC was extended to the
appellant. The other co-accused namely Ajmal,
Mir Aftab and Jamal Sher were declared
proclaimed offenders and perpetual warrants of
arrest were issued against them; hence appeal
by the convict-appellant and murder reference
to this Court by the learned trial Court.

9. We had the advantage of hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the convict-
appellant and learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant; and going through
the record with their valuable assistance.

10. The perusal of record would amply
demonstrate that conviction of the appellant
under Section 302 (b) PPC and award of
sentence of death to him by the learned trial
Court was largely influenced by the fact of
complainant in the case carrying stamp of
injury on his person, motive for the offence

cited as dispute over a woman, daughter of Mir
Aftab (father of the appellant and also an
absconding co-accused), medical evidence in
line with ocular account, no chance of mistaken
identity as both the parties were co-villagers,
minor contradictions not having any bearing on
case of the prosecution, belated plea of alibi
taken by the appellant, the appellant
nominated in the promptly lodged FIR,
consistency in the statements of the
complainant and the other eye witness and
abscondence of the appellant for some time
after the occurrence.

11. To begin with, the so-called promptly
lodged FIR is based on the murasila (EXPA/1),
which laid foundation of the case, but indeed a
shaky one, as there seems. to_ be
addition/interpolation of Liaqat Ali as rider on
the murasila. In any case, according to learned
counsel for the appellant, the omission on the
part of the scribe of the murasila to show time
of the report, together with omission on the

part of the complainant to specify types of
weapons of offence used in the commission of
offence, would give rise to the suspicion that
report of the complainant was later on recorded
after consultation and deliberations.

12. In the FIR, dispute over women folk has
been cited as motive for the offence, but the
prosecution failed to prove on record that
deceased Zard Ali had any such dispute with the
appellant, who though belong to the same
family, as co-accused Ajmal is his real brother
and co-accused Mir Aftab is his father while the
other absconding co-accused Jamal Sher has
been shown as his nephew. The record on the
other hand, would show that daughter of
absconding co-accused, Mir Aftab, who was
married to the complainant, committed suicide,
but the accused had charged the complainant,
who was acquitted in the case. It may be noted
here that the other so-called eye witness, who
did not sustain even a single scratch in the
occurrence despite shown at a very close

distance from the accused, is the real brother of
deceased Zard Ali Khan, but the complainant
had no such relationship with the deceased who
is distantly related to the latter; hence,
possibility of false implication of the appellant
owing to the aforesaid motive.

13. Although, the I.0 secured blood stained
earth form the place assigned in the site plan to
the deceased Zard Ali, but no blood stained
earth etc was recovered from the place assigned
in the site plan to the injured complainant, who
had also received a firearm injury on his
shoulder with corresponding exit wound, and
his blood stained garments were also taken into
possession by the I.0, which were sent by the
Medical Officer to the former after medical
examination of the injured complainant. The
absence of blood stained earth etc at the place
assigned to the complainant in the site plan
would, obviously, raise question about his
presence on the spot at the time of occurrence.
14. During spot inspection, the IO

recovered 15 empty shells of 7.62 bore lying in
scattered condition adjacent to the place
assigned in the site plan to absconding accused
Ajmal, wherefrom a mobile phone (Nokia) anda
Kalashnikov charger containing 4 rounds
belonging to the accused were also recovered;
but neither the crime empties nor the
Kalashnikov charger and live rounds were sent
to the firearms expert in order to determine this
fact that whether all the empty shells were fired
from the same weapon or different weapons,
especially in view of the fact that 4 persons had
been charged for indiscriminate firing on the
deceased as well as injured-complainant, and
the Kalashnikov charger along with the live
rounds as well as empty shells were recovered
from the close proximity of only one out of four
accused, namely, Ajmal. This fact, together with
the fact that all the four firearms entry wounds,
two entry wounds on the body of the deceased
and two entry wounds on the _ injured-
complainant are of the same size and dimension

i.e. % x % inch, would embrace the possibility of
commission of offence by a single person with
the same weapon of offence, more-so, in the
absence of report of firearms expert about use
of different weapon of offence in the
commission of the offence; thus creating
reasonable doubt about involvement of more
than one members of the same family in the
commission of offence, especially the appellant,
as the above referred recoveries were
attributed only to absconding co-accused Ajmal.
15. We have _ seriously taken into
consideration the contentions of learned
counsel for the appellant that, the prosecution
attempted to develop the story of the deceased,
complainant and PW Liaqat Ali coming back
together from village Shewa to their village
Sheikh Jana. According to the PWs, the deceased
and PWs had gone to the Dera of one Safdar
situated in village Shewa for purchasing a cow
from him; but neither the cow was brought by
them nor the said Safdar was ever examined in

the case to lend credence to the said story. The
statements of the two important witnesses of
the prosecution, namely Asghar
Jan/complainant (PW8) and Liaqat Ali/eye
witness (PW.9) were shown not consistent with
each other on this important aspect of the case.
PW.8 stated that they had left for village Shewa
at about 6.00 P.M, whereas PW.9 mentioned
this time as 400/0500/05.30 PM. It was the
month of Ramadan, and according to PW.8, they
offered their prayers there and spent about 30
minutes with Safdar. According to PW.8, the
distance between Sheikh Jana and village Shewa
could be covered within one hour on foot. If
statement of PW.8 is to be believed, after
leaving for village Shewa at 6.00 PM, covering
distance from Sheikh Jana to village Shewa on
foot within one hour, spending 30 minutes with
the said Safdar and then covering the distance
from Hujra of Safdar to the place of occurrence
within 25 minutes, they approximately reached
the place of occurrence at 7.55/8.00 PM, which

seemingly runs counter to the time of
occurrence shown in the FIR as 7.25 P.M.
Likewise, PW.9 contradicts this position by
saying that the place of their destination was at
a distance of about 30 minutes walk from his
house, as against the time of one hour on foot
shown for such a distance in the statement of
PW.8. There is also apparent inconsistency in
the statements of these two PWs with regard to
the price of cow settled between them and the
said Safdar, as according to PW.8 the sale price
was Rs.65000/-, while according to PW.9 the
business was struck for Rs.40,000/-. In his
statement before the Court, he and deceased
Zard Ali were proceeding ahead while Liaqat Ali
was following them at a distance of 10/12 paces
and that distance between them and the
assailants was 17 paces; but in his statement
before the police, PW.9 had stated that he was
ahead of the complainant and the deceased at
the relevant time, and thus apparently made
improvement in his statement before the Court

by stating that he was following them. PW.8
stated that all the accused simultaneously
opened fire at them, whereas, PW.9 made
statement to the effect that first fire was made
by the appellant and then the other accused.
Intriguingly, the accused were not charged in
the FIR for also attempting at the life of the
other companion of the deceased and injured
complainant namely Liagat Ali, who reportedly
escaped unheard in the occurrence.

16. No doubt, testimony of a_ witness
carrying stamp of injury on his person is
considered crucial for just and fair decision in
such like cases, but such testimony ought to ring
true and not tainted with contradictions and
improvement or possibility of motive for false
implication of the opposite side. The above
stated discrepancies, rather contradictions and
improvements, as well as fatal omissions on the
part of the Investigating Officer, are bound to
leave case of the prosecution, of course to the
extent of the appellant, nowhere. It seems that

all the above stated facts, perhaps, escaped the
notice of the learned trial Court while awarding
the penalty of death to the appellant on the
basis of such evidence. To say the least, the
above stated facts formed part of material
contradictions in the case qua the appellant,
apart from plea of alibi which was, however,
abandoned by learned defence counsel while
arguing the case at the bar. Needless to say that
an accused may take any plea in his defence, but
his failure to substantiate such a plea would not
automatically result in success of the case of
prosecution, which is, otherwise, legally bound
to prove its case to the hilt, beyond any shadow
of doubt, regardless of weaknesses in the case
of the defence. In the circumstances, explained
above, the past criminal history of the appellant
and his abscondence for sometime would,
ipsofacto, not make him liable to the penalty of
death for the alleged Qatl-i-Amd of Zard Ali and
attempt at the life of complainant, unless the

same were credibly corroborated by truthful
20

and confidence inspiring evidence of the
prosecution.

17. It needs be stressed that these findings
are confined to the role of the appellant in the
case, and shall have no bearing on the case
against the absconding co-accused, who are still
fugitive from law and have not surrendered for
facing trial in the case registered against them
on 04.07.2014.

18. In view of the forgoing discussion, the
prosecution was unable to bring home charge
against the appellant, who is, therefore,
acquitted of the charges by extending him the
benefit of doubt. The appeal is accepted and the
impugned judgment/order dated 02.12.2016 of
the learned trial Court/ASJ-I, Swabi, is,
accordingly, set aside to the extent of the
appellant, together with convictions and
sentences awarded to him in the case. The
appellant be set at liberty, if not required in any

other case.

19. Murder reference No.19-P/2016 sent by
the learned trial Court for confirmation of the

sentence is answered in the negative.
