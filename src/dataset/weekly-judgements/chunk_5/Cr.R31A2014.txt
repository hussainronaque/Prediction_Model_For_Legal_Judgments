SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.-
Muhammad Arif, petitioner, invoked the revisional
jurisdiction of this Court under section 439 Cr.P.C
by filing the instant criminal revision petition
challenging validity of order dated 05.07.2014
passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
Mansehra, whereby, application of the petitioner for
his exemption from personal appearance before the
trial Court, in case FIR No.315 dated 05.11.2012
under section 337-F(ii)/337-A(i1)/336/34 PPC,
Police Station Battal, was dismissed. The petitioner
has prayed that:

“On acceptance of instant revision
petition, the order of learned
Additional Sessions  Judge-IV,
Mansehra, may kindly be set-aside
and exemption may kindly be
granted to the petitioner from
personal appearance and_ his
attendance may kindly be marked
through counsel.”

2. Brief facts of the case leading to the
filing of present revision petition are that petitioner
alongwith his father and brother was charged in case
FIR No.315. After completion of investigation,
challan was submitted before the learned trial Court,
where charge was framed against the accused
including the petitioner. During trial, petitioner
moved an application for his exemption from
personal appearance through his counsel, which was
turned down by the learned trial Court/Additional
Sessions Judge-IV, Mansehra vide order dated
05.07.2014, hence, the instant revision petition for
the same relief.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner
contended that the learned trial Court without
considering the prevailing circumstances turned down
the application of the petitioner for his exemption
from personal appearance and he argued that the order
of the learned trial Court is not in accordance with the
law on the subject. In support of his arguments,

learned counsel for petitioner placed reliance on Shah
Zaman’s case (PLD 1993 Peshawar 155) and Dr.
Ali Yahya’s case (1989 P.Cr.L.J 1652) and prayed
for setting aside the order of learned trial Court and
granting exemption to the petitioner from personal
appearance on acceptance of his revision petition.

4. Conversely, learned Assistant Advocate
General, while controverting the contentions of
learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia contended
that exemption from personal appearance could not be
granted to the petitioner in his absence. He submitted

‘

that the august Apex Court in case titled ‘Haji

Aurangzeb_Vs. Mushtaq Ahmad _and_another’
(PLJ 2004 SC 533) has distinguished the case law
relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned Assistant Advocate General
heard and available record perused with their able
assistance.

6. Perusal of record reveals that petitioner,
Muhammad Arif, alongwith other co-accused was
charged in case FIR No.315 under sections 337-
F(ii)/337-A(ii)/336 PPC of Police Station Battal. It is
evident from record of the case that charge against the

accused was framed on 05.01.2013. It may be
mentioned here that an application was moved on
01.06.2013 on behalf of petitioner Muhammad Arif
alongwith co-accused Muhammad _ Riaz and
Muhammad Arshad for their exemption from personal
appearance on the ground that petitioner and accused
Muhammad Riaz were student of Matric in
Government High School, Jalgali and accused
Muhammad Arshad was. getting education in
‘Madrassa’. Thereafter, accused/petitioner
Muhammad Arif remained present on each date of
hearing till 15.02.2014. However, on 29.03.2014
petitioner was absent and an application for his
exemption from personal appearance was moved by
his counsel on the ground that he had gone to Karachi
for earning livelihood. The learned trial Court
allowed the said application for that day only. As the
petitioner could not appear before the learned trial
Court on next date of hearing, notice of application
dated 01.06.2013 already placed on file was given to
the other side. Consequently, the learned trial Court
dismissed the said application to the extent of
petitioner, Muhammad Arif on the ground that under
the law petitioner was required to have present before

the trial Court.
7. No doubt, trial could be held in absence
of an accused in certain cases, as envisaged in section
540-A Cr.P.C. For the sake of ready reference, the
said provisions are reproduced below:

“540-A. Provision for inquiries an trial
being held in the absence of accused in
certain cases. (1) At any stage of an inquiry
or trial under this Code, where two or more
accused are before the court, if the Judge or
Magistrate is satisfied for reason to be
recorded, that any one or more of such
accused is or incapable of remaining before
the Court, he may, if such accused is
represented by a pleader, dispense with his
attendance and proceed with such inquiry or
trial in his absence, and may, at any
subsequent stage of the proceedings, direct
the personal attendance of such accused.

(2) If the accused in any such case is not

represented by a pleader, or if the Judge or

Magistrate considers his personal attendance

necessary, he may, if he thinks fit, and for

reasons to be recorded by him either adjourn

such inquiry or trial, or order that the case of

such accused be taken up or tried

separately.”
It is very much obvious that the grant of exemption to
an accused from his personal appearance during the
trial is discretionary in nature and it depends upon the
satisfaction of the Judge regarding his incapability of
remaining before the Court. It is clear from the
abovementioned provisions of law that accused must

be before the Court at the time of seeking exemption

from his personal appearance during the trial. It has
been clearly held in Haji Aurangzeb’s case (Supra)
that:

“It is clear to us that none of the relied
upon precedent cases support the wild
proposition canvassed by learned counsel
before us. We will, therefore, conclude that
normally the accused has to be physically
present in the Court for claiming
exemption and that if the Court is satisfied
about his incapability of remaining before
the Court, the Court may proceed to grant
exemption. Incapability is word of wide
import and may cover all circumstances
beyond the control of the accused. The
exemption could be granted in absence in
extremely exceptional cases like ailment of
accused which rendered his movement
difficult (like the case of paralysis) or
departure from country or station is
absolutely necessary and there is no time to
have recourse to the Court for seeking
permission/exemption. It may be observed
that the provision i.e. Section 540-A Cr.P.C
covered cases of temporary exemption from
one or two dates of hearing or exemption
till the conclusion of inquiry/trial. The
Courts have to pass appropriate orders
depending on the facts and circumstances
of the case.”

In the instant case, application for exemption was
filed by the petitioner on 01.06.2013 and exemption
was sought by him on the ground that he was student
of Matric in Government High School, Jalgali.
Subsequently, the petitioner, without getting decision
of said application, left for Karachi for earning his
livelihood and remained absent from the Court till
05.07.2014. It is important to note that on 29.03.2014
another application for exemption of petitioner was

filed in his absence which was allowed only for that
date, however on subsequent dates, he failed to appear
before the learned trial Court and thus on 10.06.2014
NBWA was issued against him and notice was also
given to his sureties. However, he again failed to
appear before the Court. Moreover, learned counsel
for the petitioner could not point out any illegality or
material irregularity in the impugned order of learned
trial Court refusing exemption from personal
appearance during the trial to the accused.

8. Thus, keeping in view the above facts
and circumstances of the case and discussion made
thereupon, present criminal revision petition having
without any force is dismissed.
