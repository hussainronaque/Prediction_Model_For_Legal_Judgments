and complainant by Mr. Bilal Zaman

FAZAL SUBHAN, J. Accused/petitioner

Muhammad ljaz Saeed seeks his release
on bail in case FIR No. 27/2022 dated:
27.07.2022 under sections 109 PPC, 22
(B) of Emigration Act read with section
3,6 PSMA, registered at Police Station,
FIA/C.C, District, Abbottabad.

2. Complainant/Mst. Sughra Bibi
reported the matter to the local police that
her son namely Faizan Ahmad met with
some unknown agents who offer him a
Candian visa. That her son was sent to

Iran by the human traffickers/smugglers
to further send him to Canada, but in Iran
those traffickers/smugglers detained him
and asked from his family for ransom of
Rs. 700,000/- through telephone number
00989376048842 (Iran dialing code
through call) and +0306985069280
(Greece dialing code through whatsup).
Family deposited Rs. 100,000/- into the
account of Muhammad Ijaz son of
Ghulam Fareed account 0297-
0010047743850018 (Allied Bank
Bahawalpur). That human
traffickers/smugglers gave threats to his
family that they will kill victim if they do
not arrange the remaining amount so.
Complainant also alleged that human
traffickers threatened that they would kill
the victim in case the further payment is
not made. She produced the deposit slips
and call recording before the FIA
authorities, therefore, the instant FIR was

registered.
3. Arguments of learned counsel for
petitioner, complainant as well as learned
AAG heard and record perused.

4. From the record, it is clear that the
complainant Mst. Sughran widow of
Muhammad Mushtaq has directly named
the petitioner in her report for alluring her
son on the pretext of sending him to
Canada (foreign country). The petitioner
contacted the complainant and demanded
Rs. 36,00,000/-, however, she being poor
lady, only managed to arrange Rs.
1,00,000/-, which were transferred to his
account, and the bank statement available
on file confirms the receipt of said
amount and its withdrawal. The
whereabouts of the son of complainant
are not known whereas, through a viral
video available in USB, the son of
complainant is in custody of the person
connected with the petitioner. CDR
available on file shows the contacts of
petitioner with one Mst. Kausar Parveen,

a member of gang. It is argued that now
ransom has been demanded through Mst.
Kausar Parveen for the release of son of
complainant and therefore, section 365-A
PPC is attracted to the case,

5. For the time being, section 365-A
PPC is not applied to the case, however,
section 22 (b) of the Emigration
Ordinance, 1979 has been applied, which
provides punishment of 14 years with
fine, hence, it falls within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr. P.C. Similarly,
section 3/6 of Prevention of Smuggling of
Migrants Act, also provides 14 yearsâ€™
punishment, hence, from tentative
assessment of record, petitioner is prima
facie connected with a crime, which falls
within the prohibitory clause of section
497 Cr. P. C and therefore, he is not
found to be entitled for grant of bail.
Resultantly, this petition is dismissed.

Announced.
