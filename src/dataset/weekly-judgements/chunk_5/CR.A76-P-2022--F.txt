2. The case of the prosecution, in a nutshell, as spelt
out in the FIR (EX PA) is that on 12.04.2012 complainant
Gulistan son of Umbara Khan with the help of co-villagers
brought the dead body of his deceased son namely Mawais
Khan to Police Station, Kalu Khan, in a Datsun Pickup,
and reported the matter to the effect that he alongwith his
brother namely Bostan and his son Mawais Khan were
returning from the house of his nephew Muhammad Jan to
their houses at night and when reached near the house of
Fazal Muhammad, accused Shah Jehan son of Farman Gul
duly armed with Kalashnikov appeared in front of
complainant party and fired at Mawais Khan, who was
proceeding ahead of the complainant and eyewitness
Bostan and; as a result of such firing the deceased got hit

and died on the spot; that a bulb was lit at that time; that
motive behind the occurrence was altercation took place
between the accused and deceased over cutting of
“Bakayan Trees” few days before the occurrence; that the
occurrence was witnessed by the complainant and his
brother Bostan. Report of the complainant was reduced
into writing vide FIR (EX PA). After the occurrence, the
accused went into hiding and remained absconders and
after completion of investigation, complete challan under
section-512 Cr.PC was submitted. Later on, accused Shah
Jehan on 20.06.2019 came to Police Station and
surrendered himself to the police and was arrested vide his
card of arrest (EX PW 6/1).

3. After completion of investigation, supplementary
challan against the accused-appellant was submitted before
the Court. Formal Charge was framed against him to which
he did not plead guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution in order to prove its case, produced
as many as twelve (12) witnesses. On conclusion of
prosecution evidence, statement of accused under section-
342 Cr.PC was recorded, wherein he professed innocence

and falsely charged. He neither wished to record his
statement on Oath within the meaning of section-340 (2)
Cr.PC nor opted to produce evidence in defence. After
hearing the learned counsel for the parties and appraisal of
evidence available on the file, the learned trial Court vide
impugned judgment dated 19.01.2022 convicted and
sentenced the appellant, as described in the opening
paragraph of the judgment.

5. Feeling aggrieved from his conviction and
sentences, the appellant has approached this Court by
filing the instant Criminal Appeal with the prayer that the
impugned judgment may be set aside and he may be
acquitted from the charges leveled against him; while the
complainant-petitioner has filed Cr. Revision No.13-
P/2022 for enhancement of compensation amount.

6. | We have heard arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties and perused the record carefully with their
valuable assistance.

7. In this case, the occurrence took place on
12.04.2012 at 20.00 hours, the complainant Gulistan (PW-
08) lodged report in Police Station, Kalu Khan, with Police

at 22.10 hours to the effect that on the night of occurrence,
he alongwith Bostan, his brother and Mawais Khan, his
deceased son were returning from the house of Muhammad
Jan, his nephew, when reached near the house of Fazal
Muhammad, accused Shah Jehan was present there duly
armed with Kalashnikov started firing at his deceased son
Mawais Khan, who was few paces ahead of them, with
which he got hit and died on the spot. The complainant in
his report / FIR (EX PA) as well as Court Statement
advanced the motive behind the occurrence to be
altercation took place in between the accused Shah Jehan
and deceased Mawais Khan over cutting of Bakayan trees.
This PW in cross examination admitted that his father
Umbara Khan had gifted 07 marlas landed property to Mst.
Faqir Taja on which she had constructed house and used to
reside in it alongwith the accused, he also admitted that
accused wanted to sell out that house and he was willing to
purchase the same at the market rate, but, he refused to sell
it out to him. Contrary to the motive advanced by the
complainant in his report (EX PA), the Investigating
Officer (PW-10) during cross examination stated that; “It

is correct that during the course of investigation, it
transpired that the actual dispute was not the cutting of
trees, but, it was refusal of the accused to sell his
constructed house to the complainant which was
constructed by the accused on seven (07) marla piece of
land donated to Mst. Faqir Taja by Umbara Khan, the
father of complainant and Mst. Fagir Taja. In this
connection, I have recorded the statements of Umbara
Khan, Bostan, Gul Muhammad and Danish Khan in
connection with the dispute mentioned above. Though
the accused wanted to sell out the said house but had
refused to sell it out to the complainant because the
complainant wanted to purchase the house on lower
market rate / value but the accused was not ready to
accept the said price.” This PW further stated that he has
recorded the statement of PW Bostan at about 11:30 pm
and that the said Bostan had not disclosed the motive as
altercation over cutting of trees rather had disclosed the
dispute over not selling of the house by the accused to the
complainant Gulistan. From the above quoted statement of
the Investigating Officer (PW-10) that there is direct

motive in between accused and complainant Gulistan over
the refusal of accused about non-selling of his house to the
complainant on low market price. Since the direct motive
was in between complainant and accused and; it is not
possible that he would have been spared if he was present
at the spot at the relevant time. In this regard reliance is
placed upon the judgment rendered by the Hon’ble Apex
Court in case titled “Amin Khan..vs..Janab Gul and
others” (1984 SCMR-937).

The complainant in cross examination stated that he
had pointed out the place of cutting of trees to the I.O and
had also shown the cut trees to the 1.0, but, contrary to the
above narration, the ILO (PW-10) in cross examination
stated that the complainant had not shown to him the place
wherefrom the trees were cut nor he had taken into
possession any cut trees or its branches. Complainant
Gulistan (PW-8) in cross examination stated that they had
gone to the house of Muhammad Jan for inquiring about
his health and that they remained in the house of
Muhammad Jan for about 15 minutes; while Bostan
(PW-9) in his cross examination stated that they remained

in the house of Muhammad Jan for about 4/5 minutes and
further stated that Muhammad Jan was not available at that
time in the house and only women folk were available
there. The Investigating Officer (PW-10) in cross
examination stated that he has not recorded the statement
of one Muhammad Jan whose house was allegedly visited
by the complainant party prior to the occurrence, nor he
has examined any other inmates of the said house. Bostan
the eyewitness (PW-9) in cross examination stated that the
deceased was fired at from Eastern side and that the firing
was made from a distance of about 15 paces; while in the
site plan (EX PB) the deceased has been shown at Point-1
while the accused has been shown at Point-4 and the
distance between the deceased and the accused has been
mentioned as 06 paces. In the site plan a bulb has been
shown lit at Point-B, but the distance of Point-B with other
points has not been mentioned in the site plan. It is also
pertinent to mention here that the distance between Point-1
allotted to deceased and Point-4 allotted to accused has
been shown 06 paces and that of complainant and
eyewitness i.e points 2 & 3 and deceased has been shown

as 10/11 paces respectively. On calculation of distance as
shown in between the complainant, eye witness and
deceased and that of deceased and accused comes to 16/17
paces. The Investigating Officer (PW-10) during cross
examination stated that PW Bostan had not disclosed any
source of light to him in his statement recorded under
section-161 Cr.PC and further stated that he has not
examined Adal Muhammad whose Dera is situated near
the spot even to the extent of recovery of bulb into his
possession. It is also significant to note that the alleged
bulb which was lit on the wall of room of hujra owned by
the said Adal Muhammad no electricity bill in the name of
Adal Muhammad was taken into possession by the [.O in
order to establish ownership of the said hujra. As per
murasila, the occurrence took place in a thoroughfare and
on both sides of the said thoroughfare there is Abadi,
however, the Investigating Officer (PW-10) in cross
examination stated that he had not found any bullet marks
on the walls of the houses etc nor have found any spent
bullet / pellet.

The complainant in cross examination stated that

Police Post Permoli is situated at a distance of 15/16 meter
10

(K.M) from the spot and categorically admitted that he had
not taken the dead body to Police Post Permoli for
recording his report. He further stated that police station
Kalu Khan is at a distance of 25/26 miles from the spot;
while as per FIR EX PA, the distance between the place of
occurrence and police station has been shown as 12/13
kilometers. The complainant in his cross examination
further stated that;

“Several persons attracted to the spot after the
occurrence. I had not narrated the occurrence to
those persons who attracted to the spot after the
occurrence. The dead body remained on the spot for
about 30 to 40 minutes. We placed the dead body on
a Datsun Pickup on the spot. I alongwith PW-
Bostan, Zaman Sher and other persons took the
dead body to the PS from the spot.”

The occurrence had taken place on a thoroughfare and as
per site plan (EX PB) on both sides of the thoroughfare
there are houses and Hujra and that several persons
attracted to the spot after the occurrence, but, even then the
dead body of the deceased was lying on the spot for about
30 to 40 minutes and could not shifted the dead body to

P.P Permoli which is situated at a short distance, which
11
could be covered within short time. It is also pertinent to
mention here that as per Postmortem report (EX PM) the
probable time between injury and death has been
mentioned within 20 minutes. Complainant Gulistan (PW-
8) and Bostan (PW-9) the eyewitness in their respective
cross examination stated that they all placed the dead body
of the deceased in a Datsun Pickup after about 30 minutes
of the occurrence and all accompanied the dead body to the
PS, but, they did not utter a single word that their hands
and clothes were besmeared with the blood of deceased, |
but, even they did not produce their clothes besmeared
with the blood of the deceased to the I.O. The Investigating
Officer (PW-10) did not bother to record the statement of
driver of the Datsun Pickup and other persons who
accompanied the dead body to the PS in order to establish
the prosecution version regarding shifting the dead body to
the PS in Datsun Pickup. Moreover, there is an
unexplained delay of more than two hours in lodging the
report, however, the prosecution has advanced reason for it
that the road leading from Sher Dara to PS Kalu Khan was

a Kacha one at that time, but, it is not appealable to a
12
prudent mind keeping in view the distance between the
spot and PS Kalu Khan, when the complainant voluntarily
stated that there is metal road from Shewa Adda to PS
Kalu Khan, which they had adopted for approaching the
P.S. While 1.0 (PW-10) in his cross examination has stated
that he reached the spot at 22:45 hours, obviously he went
to spot after registration of FIR within 35 minutes as time
of report is 22:10 hours. In our view an abortive attempt
has been made by prosecution witnesses to overcome the
question of delay in FIR.

Complainant Gulistan (PW-8) and eyewitness
Bostan (PW-9) have alleged that they have identified the
accused in the light of bulb. Even otherwise, if it is
presumed for a while that the complainant and eye-
witness have identified the assailant in the light of bulb
even in that eventuality the identification of the appellant
by the complainant and eyewitness at dark night hours is
an important aspect of the case, which needs cautious
attention by this Court. As per FIR EX PA, the time of
occurrence has been mentioned as 20:00 hours in the

month of April and according to prosecution, the
13
complainant and alleged eye-witness had identified the
appellant in light of electric bulb installed in the
thoroughfare, but, PW Bostan in his statement recorded
under section-161 Cr.PC did not utter a single word
regarding the bulb. Though vide recovery memo EX PW
7/3 a 100 watt bulb was taken into possession by the I.O,
which was allegedly lit in the thoroughfare, but, Waraish
Khan alias Quresh (PW-7) who is marginal witness to
the said recovery memo in cross examination stated that
it was about 10:00/10:30 p.m when he thumb impressed
the above referred recovery memos and that he does not
know if any house or Hujra were situated near the place
of occurrence; while the Investigating Officer (PW-10)
in the opening sentence of cross examination stated that
he had reached the spot at 22:45 hours. Thus, the
prosecution has badly failed to prove the source of light
on or near the place of occurrence to corroborate the
assertion of the complainant and eye-witness regarding
identification of the appellant in the pitch dark,
therefore, their testimony to this effect, being suspect

evidence, is also not believable. Wisdom is drawn from
14
the judgment of the august Supreme Court of Pakistan

rendered in the case of Muhammad Arshad v. The State

(PLD 1995 SC 475). The principle laid down in the said
judgment is as follows.

“The principle to be extracted from the decided
case thus is that the evidence of visual
identification is one of the categories of ‘suspect
evidence’ and that ordinarily it is not safe to
convict on the basis of such evidence without a
corro-boration. Indeed, in exceptional
circumstances, that is, where the evidence of
visual identification is of exceptionally good
quality, such as, where the offender was known to
the witness, there was sufficient light, the witness
had had an unobstructed view of the offender and
there was a dialogue between the witness and the
offender, the evidence may be acted upon.”

8. In addition to above, the assailants chose the
nocturnal time for killing the deceased to conceal the
identity and for that purpose he must have taken all
necessary precautions in view whereof it was not so easy
for the complainant and eyewitness to identify him in the
mode and manner as narrated by them in their
statements. In other words, if their statements are
believed, it would mean that the assailant had willfully
exposed his identity to the complainant at the time of
firing, specifically when there is agricultural property

owned by Qamar Zaman son of Dolat Khan, which is
15
adjacent to the place of occurrence mentioned in the site
plan and the assailant could easily conceal his identity in
the landed property and achieve the target. If that was
the aim of the assailant he would have never chosen the
night time for committing the crime rather he would
have committed the same in broad daylight. So, keeping
in view the time as well as mode and manner of the
occurrence, identification of the appellant by the
complainant and eyewitness is doubtful. Reference in

this regard is made to the judgment of this Court

rendered in the case of Muhammad Arif v. State and

another (1999 PCr.LJ 707), wherein it is held that:

“The occurrence had taken place at 0600 hours
ie. one hour before the sun-rise time. It is a
matter of common observation that one hour
before sun-rise time is always pitch dark. The
said time was chosen by the assailant only and
only in order to conceal his identity. That is why
he fired from behind causing all the three inlet
wounds at the back side of the body which also
contained charring marks”.

Thus, looking at the attending circumstances of the
present case through the prism of the above-referred case
law, identification of the assailants by the complainant
and eyewitness is not free from doubt, the benefit of

which must be given to appellant as per well settled
16
principle of criminal justice. The mode and manner as
narrated by complainant and eyewitness is not appealable
and believable to a prudent mind.

The nutshell of the foregoing discussion is that the
prosecution has not been able to prove the charge against
the appellant beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt, the
benefit thereof must accrue in favour of the accused as
matter of right and not of grace. In this regard we are
fortified by the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court
rendered in Tariq Pervez’s (1995 SCMR 1345), wherein it
was observed that for giving the benefit of doubt, it was
not necessary that there should be many circumstances
creating doubts. If there is circumstance which created
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of the
accused, then the accused would be entitled to the benefit
of doubt not as a matter of grace and concession but as a
matter of right.

9. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we
accept this Cr. Appeal No.76-P/2022, set aside the
impugned judgment dated 19.01.2022 passed by the

learned trial Court, and acquit the appellant of the charges
17
leveled against him. He be released forthwith, if not
required in any other case.

As Cr.Appeal No.76-P/2022 filed by appellant Shah
Jehan against his conviction and sentence, has been
allowed, therefore, Murder Reference No.2-P/2022 sent by
the trial Court is answered in negative and the Cr. Revision
No.13-P/2022 filed by complainant Gulistan against
convict-appellant Shah Jehan for enhancement of
compensation amount has become infructuous and stands
dismissed.

Above are the detailed reasons of our short order of

even date.
