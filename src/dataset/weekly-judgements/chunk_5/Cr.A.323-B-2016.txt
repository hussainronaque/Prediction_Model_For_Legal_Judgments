to the legal heirs of the deceased and if fails to pay the
same shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue at
proper time failing which he will suffer six months R.

subject to separate order.

2. The learned trial Court has also sent Murder
Reference No.07-B/2016 for confirmation of death
sentence. Since the appeal and murder reference are the
outcome of one and the same judgment, therefore, these

are being disposed of through this single judgment.

3. The story of prosecution as narrated in FIR
(Ex.PW-10/1) is that on 25.9.1996 at 1100 hours, (PW-
10) complainant Muhammad Jan Baz Khan brought the
dead body of his cousin Ameer Faraz to the Police
Station and reported the matter to the local police that on
the fateful day he alongwith deceased had gone to the
shop of Nasib Khan, when came out of the shop at about
1130 hours, the appellant armed with Kalashnikov
emerged, made Lalkara and _ started firing at the

deceased due to which he was hit and died on the spot.

The complainant chased the accused to catch him but at
some distance, co-accused Zafar Iqbal and Rasool
Badshah duly armed were also present there who made
firing at him but he escaped unhurt.

4. After completion of investigation, complete
challan was submitted. Accused Zafar Iqbal alias Jabal
and Rasool Badshah faced the trial and on conclusion of
trial they were acquitted while the appellant was
declared as proclaimed offender vide judgment dated
11.9.2003. Later on, the appellant was arrested and
supplementary challan against him was submitted. The
iearned trial Court, on conclusion of trial, convicted and
sentenced the appellant as referred above, vide judgment
dated 28.7.2016, which is impugned before us.

5. At the very outset, learned counsel for the
appellant submitted that, though, the learned trial Court
has appraised and taken into consideration the testimony
(S12 Crec statements) of two witnesses, i.e, PW Dr.
Abdul Samad and PW Awal Khan SHO, but did not

pass any formal order regarding the ante of their

statements from the file of previous trial of co-accused
into the present tial ad as such committed gross

illegality, therefore, thé impugned judgment of

conviction is liable to be set aside.

6. Learned counsel for the complainant

opposed the same while learned A.A.G for the State
conceded to the legal preposition. He submitted that
| statements of these two PWs need to be transferred into
the trial of the appellant in accordance with law,
therefore. the case be remanded to the learned trial
Court.

7. Order sheet No.18 dated 01.02.2016 of

learned trial Court depicts that counsel for the
complainant moved an application duly endorsed by
SPP regarding taking into account earlier statements of
PW Awal Khan retired SHO recorded as PW-7 and
PW-11 during trial of co-accused, by then the appellant
was absconding but the learned trial Court kept pending
the said application by holding that “the request would

be seen in purview of Article 46(2) of the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984 at the relevant time of
judgment”. Vide same order sheet fresh summon was
also issued to PW Dr. Abdul Samad through Vice
Chancellor Khyber Medical University, Peshawar and
case was adjourned to 25.02.2016. On 25.02.2016 the
case was adjoumed to 21.3.2016 due to Note Reader. On
21.53.2016, counsel for complainant submitted an
application duly forwarded by APP, whereby request for
taking into account previous statement of PW Dr. Abdul
Samad, recorded as PW-4, was made. This application
was also kept pending by holding that “the request
would be seen in purview of Article 46 (2) of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 at the relevant time of
judgment”,

8. After going through the judgment, it
appears that the testimony of these two witnesses was
taken into consideration against the appellant when he

was convicted in the above terms. Needless to say that

the statements of witnesses recorded under Section 512

Cr.PC can be legitimately treated as evidence in

-6- (\ ; —
subsequent proceedings in view of provisions of Article \.. !
47 of Qanun-e-Shahadat read with Section 512 Code of

Criminal Procedure but the learned trial Court has

neither passed any order regarding transfer of statements
of above mentioned witnesses to the file of the present
case nor serious steps were taken to bring on record
evidence regarding the non-availability of Dr. Abdul
Samad and incapacitation of Awal Khan retired SHO
and thus committed illegality while passing the
impugned judgment.

9 For the reasons mentioned above, we allow
Cr.A.No.323-B/2016, set aside the impugned judgment
dated 28.7.2016 and remand the case to the learned trial
Court with the direction to make efforts for the
procurement of attendance of the subject witnesses

failing which .make order for the transfer of their
a

statements recorded during the trial of co-accused,
followed by recording of statement of the accused under

Section 342 Cr.PC and thereafter pass the judgment

alter affording opportunities of hearing to the parties.
