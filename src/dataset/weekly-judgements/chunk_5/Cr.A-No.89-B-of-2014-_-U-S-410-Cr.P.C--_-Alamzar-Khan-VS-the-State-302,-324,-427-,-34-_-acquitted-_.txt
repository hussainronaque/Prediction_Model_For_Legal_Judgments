Nawaz. is that on 15.03.2013, he alongwith deceased

Gul Nawaz was coming back to their village Seri Khwa

from village Ahmadi Banda on motorcycle, bearing

registration NO.F-8300/Bannu, which was driven by

deceased Gul Nawaz; that at 0310 hours, when they

reached at place of occurrence known as “Taraqi

Ghusha” absconding co-accused Saeed Rahman and

appellant/accused Alam Zar, who were already

ambushed, on seeing them, they started firing at

complainant party with their respective weapons; that
from the firing of absconding co-accused Saeed ur

Rehman, Gul Nawaz was hit and had died on the spot,

while from the firing of appellant/accused Alam Zar,

complainant was hit on his right hand and got injured;

that the occurrence has also been witnessed by PWs

Hameed Khan and Shahid Nawaz who were behind

them on motor cycle. Motive as disclosed by the

complainant is blood feud between deceased Gul Nawaz

and accused party. Consequently on the report of

complainant, murasila was drafted and sent to the Police

station, on the basis of which FIR (ibid) was registered

against absconding accused including the appellant.

4. After completion of investigation,

complete challan was submitted before the trial court

against appellant/ accused Alamzar as well as for

proceedings under section 512 Cr.P.C against

absconding co-accused Saeed ur Rahman. Formal

charge against appellant/accused was framed to which
he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Trial was

commenced.

5. The prosecution in order to prove its case,

examined as many as twelve (12) PWs including

complainant Haq Nawaz, eye witness Hameed Khan .

6. Ocular account of the occurrence in this

case has come out from the statements of complainant

Haq Nawaz (PW-10), eye witness namely Hameed

Khan (PW-11); Dr. Atif ur Rehman Medical officer

THQ hospital, Banda Daud Shah as PW-3, who has

The statements of remaining witnesses

are formal in nature.

8. After conclusion of trial statement of

appellant/accused U/S 342 Cr.P.C was recorded

wherein he did not opt to examine himself under section

340 (2) Cr.P.C however, wished to produce some

documents in defence.
9. After hearing learned counsel for the

parties, appellant/ accused was convicted and sentenced

as above by the learned trial court, vide impugned

judgment dated 26/06/2014, hence the instant Appeal

for his acquittal, whereas complainant has also preferred

connected Criminal Revision No.21-B of 2015, titled

Haq Nawaz VS Alam Zar etc for enhancement of

conviction and sentence of appellant.

10. The learned counsel for appellant made his

submissions that the impugned judgment is against law

and facts on record because as per contents of FIR, only

role of causing injuries to the complainant/respondent

has been given by him to the appellant/accused; that

prosecution witnesses have improved their initial

version considerably and introduced new facts and also

referred to the contradiction between statements of

complainant Rab Nawaz (PW-10) and eye witness

Hameed Khan (PW-11), medical evidence and also
recovery witnesses but that the learned trial Court has

not properly appreciated the evidence on record and has

fallen in error of law whereby has brought under

consideration inadmissible evidence; that prosecution

has not proved its case, while the whole statements of

material PWs are inconsistent; He further contended

that the witnesses had not proved their presence at the

spot but the learned trial court has not appreciated the

available evidence in its true perspective and thereby

committed patent illegality which has occasioned in

gross mis-carriage of justice.

11. On the other hand, the learned Additional

Advocate General and the learned counsel for

respondent/complainant argued that prosecution has

produced direct and circumstantial unimpeachable,

trustworthy evidence against appellants and has proved

its case beyond any shadow of doubt; that medical as

well as circumstantial evidence in shape of recovery of
-10-

blood stained earth and blood stained garments of

deceased as well as injured and recovery of ten empty

shells of 12 bore from the spot supports the prosecution

case and in this respect the FSL reports are also in

positive; that appellant was rightly found guilty,

however, the sentence is not proper in the given

circumstances, may be enhanced.

12. We have heard arguments of learned

counsel for the parties, learned Addl.A.G for the State

and gone through the record of the case.

13. The prosecution case, as per first

information report is that the complainant has charged

the accused/ appellant for making effective firing at

him, which resulted into the injury on his right hand,

while absconding accused Saeed-ur Rehman for

committing qatl-e-amd of Gul Nawaz with shotguns,

when complainant sitting on rear seat and deceased

driving the motorcycle reached at the spot. As
-ll-

per report, Hameed Khan and Shahid Nawaz had

witnessed the occurrence, being present behind the

accused on motorcycle.

14. As the co-accused Saeedur Rehman is

absconding, we would refrain ourselves to comment on

such aspects of the case, which may affect the case of

absconding accused, like improvements, interested

witnesses, recoveries and general discrepancies or

contradictions in evidence. The complainant PW-10 in

his statement as well as first information report charged

the accused/ appellant for attempting his life by firing at

him with his shotgun, he has not charged the accused/

appellant for making firing at the deceased. The case of

present accused/ appellant falls only to the extent of

attempt to commit qatl-e-Amd of complainant or to that

effect for the injury which received the complainant or

at least sharing of intention.
15.

-12-

The complainant in his statement recorded

as PW-10, stated that:

that:

“When we reached the place of occurrence
(Taraqi Ghusha) absconding accused
Saeed Rehman and accused facing trial
Alam Zar duly armed were already present
and on seeing us they started firing upon
us, with the fire shot of absconding
accused Saeed-ur-Rehman, deceased Gul
Nawaz was hit and died on spot, while with
the fire shot of accused Alam Zar I was hit

on my right hand and got injured”

It is further stated in cross examination

“They did not fire from the front side
rather they fired upon us while we were

being crossing them.”

One fire of shot gun executes many pellets,

which expands with increase of distance, then how in

simultaneous firing that too with shotgun complainant

who is on motorcycle with deceased sitting almost

attached to each other, could distinguish the role of each
-13-

accused that whose fire-shot hit deceased and whose

fire-shot hit him. When we go through the site plan the

accused/ appellant is shown at point No.6, while the

complainant at Point No.2, distance between the two is

mentioned as 100 feet, then in such a situation, any fire

of accused is sufficient to hit both, the complainant as

well as deceased. Even further, the eye witness, Hameed

Khan examined as PW-11, who is real uncle of

deceased has stated in cross-examination that both the

accused fired simultaneously. It is by now settled that

mere presence of stamp of injuries on the person of a

witness is not a _ yardstick for determining the

truthfulness or falsehood of a witness. It cannot be

believed that every injured witness would speak the

truth and every unhurt eyewitness would tell a lie. It is

the circumstances of the case and intrinsic worth of his

statement, that determine the veracity and credibility of

a witness, which can be assessed in the light of
-14-

attending circumstances of each and every case.

Reliance is placed on case titled “Nazir Ahmad Vs

Muhammad Igqbal_and_another” (2011 SCMR_527).

While in the instant case, it is held that the complainant

has exaggerated the charge to the extent of appellant. In

similar situation the apex Court in case titled “Tawab

Khan and another Vs the Stae” (PLD 1970 Supreme
Court 13), it is held that:

“As compared to this, the case against
Tawaib Khan is very doubtful. He is
alleged to have fired from a distance of 20
yards and had allegedly succeeded in
causing only one pellet injury on the right
forearm of the deceased. There were no
indications of any firing from the spot
from which he had allegedly fired such as
we find in the case of Khawaja
Muhammad. If Tawaib Khan had fired
from that close distance-20 paces as is
alleged-he must have certainly caused a
greater damage to the deceased than is
attributed to him. He could not be such a
bad marksman as to cause only one stray
pellet injury with his gun from a distance

of 20 paces. The injuries to the deceased,
-15-

according to my view, were all caused by
two shots, one from behind and the other
from front, both of which were initially
attributed to Khawaja Muhammad by the
deceased as well as by Mst. Meraj Dana,
although, subsequently, the deceased
magnified the number of these shots to
three and Mst. Meraj Dana did so into
many more. This exaggeration was
introduced merely to ascribe the firing of a
shot by Tawaib Khan, but this, as I have

said above, is very doubtful.

In these circumstances, I am constrained
to reject the evidence of Mst. Meraj Dana
as well as of the dying declarations of the
deceased as far as Tawaib Khan is
concerned, giving him C the benefit of
doubt which, I consider, was wrongly
withheld from him by the Courts below. I
would, therefore, acquit him. As already
stated above, the guilt of Khawaja
Muhammad is established beyond doubt
and his conviction and sentence as
awarded by the trial Judge and confirmed
by the High Court, are well-merited in
which no interference is justified. I decide
the appeal accordingly. Tawaib Khan shall
be released forthwith if not wanted in any

other case.”
-16-

16. Medical evidence also belies the case of

prosecution to the extent of participation of appellant

for the reason that from the distance of 100 feet,

whether a pellet could penetrate into the body is

question for which no plausible explanation has been

mentioned nor the complainant would be in position to

specify the injury that it was caused by the appellant,

though at the trial prosecution witnesses tried to

improve their case but in our view it was an abortive

effort.

17. As per record it is evident that both the

complainant and deceased were empty handed, even the

eye witness Hameed Khan PW-11, who is real uncle of

deceased watching the tragedy but neither trying to save

deceased from accused nor prohibiting the accused from

the commission of offence. How it is possible that four

persons riding on two motorcycle having blood feud
-17-

would not carry any weapon, particularly in this area of

the country, which is beyond our comprehension.

18. Sattar Khan incharge investigation

recorded his statement as PW-12, in cross examination

he stated that:

“It is correct that I have shown two
hillocks on either side of the road, where
the occurrence took place. The height of
these hillocks might be 10 to 15 feet.”
Further prepared site plan Ex:PB, wherein he has shown
hillocks on either side of the road, which are further
clarified from photographs ExPW12/1, available on file,
wherein there are so many embankments and places
where a person could easily hid himself.
19. In addition to that the complainant in his
first information report did not stated regarding weapon
of offence, nor he stated that who was sitting on rear

seat and who was driving the motorcycle, while in his

statement recorded as PW-10, he disclosed that he was
-18-

sitting on rear seat, while the deceased was driving the

motorcycle, whereas this statement is negated by the

investigation officer Sattar Khan PW-12, who in his

cross examination categorically stated that the

deceased was sitting at the rear seat while the

complainant was driving the motorcycle, meaning

thereby that the prosecution has failed to specify

through cogent evidence, that who was driving the

motorcycle at the time of occurrence, which creates

serious doubt regarding receiving of injury by fire shot

of the accused/appellant. No doubt complainant PW-10

is an injured witness and his presence on the spot could

not be denied, but his evidence to the effect that he

received injury with the fire shot of accused/ appellant,

is not proved rather medical evidence belied the same,

as he has received other injuries also but for that injury,

the prosecution is silent that through which means the

same was caused. The complainant has not stated in
-19-

F.LR that he fell down from motorcycle during the

occurrence.

20. So for as recoveries of empties are concerned the

investigation officer recovered 10 empties in scattered

position, vide recovery memo: Ex:PF, while report of the

firearms expert is Ex:PK/1, according to which it is opined

that these were fired from different 12 bore weapons, but

this report cannot implicate the accused/ appellant, as

firstly the crime weapon has not been mentioned in the

first information report and secondly, during the trial it was

disclosed that the accused were carrying with 12 bore shot

guns, but further it has not been mentioned either it was

single barrel or double barrel, as in case of double barrel

weapon, two different striker pins are affixed for each

barrel which cause different kind of striker marks and may

result the same situation.

21. So for as site plan is concerned, it was

prepared on the pointation of PW-11, Hameed Khan on
-20-

15.03.2013, whereas the same was verified from

complainant on 26.03.2016. The site plan is not

substantive piece of evidence which may be used to

contradict or discredit the evidence of an eyewitness, but,

being the first reflection of the spot, indicated/pointed by

the eye-witness, furnishes a panoramic view of the

occurrence to scrutinize the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses tendered at the trial. Reliance is placed on case

titled “Iqbal shah Vs The State” (1998 P Cr. L J 1177).

22. So for as motive is concerned, it is always

considered as a double edge weapon which cuts both

ways and it can be used by the accused to take revenge

and at the same time can be a tool used by the

complainant, for false charge, as well, being close

relative of deceased.

23. Though in the instant case appellant-

convict has remained absconder for a considerable

period, but abscondence alone can only be used as a
-21-

circumstance against the accused and cannot be a

substitute of direct evidence. When ocular account is

disbelieved, then any circumstantial evidence in the

shape of recoveries or abscondence of accused looses

their efficacy for recording conviction of the accused.

As ocular account furnished by the complainant PW-10,

and eye witness Hameed Khan PW-11, is not worthy of

credence to the extent of accused/ appellant, on the

basis of which conviction of the appellant may be

maintained in a capital charge. Thus, abscondence, how

long so ever may be, cannot be accounted against the

appellant.

24. It is settled principle of law that when two

inferences can be drawn from the prosecution evidence,

then one favouring the accused is to be followed. When

this principle is applied to the instant case, even if one

considers that the accused/ appellant has participated in

the crime, at the same time, another circumstance
-22-

boggles the mind that he has not participated at all. In

such a situation, the best and safest course open for the

Court is to follow the latter by discarding the former.

25. It is cardinal principle of criminal justice

that prosecution is bound to prove its case beyond any

shadow of doubt and if any reasonable doubt arises in

the prosecution case, benefit of the same is to be

extended to the accused, not as a matter of grace or

concession, but as a matter of right. On reappraisal of

evidence as discussed earlier, we are of the firm view

that appellant-convict is entitled to the benefit of doubt.

Therefore, while extending the same benefit, this appeal

was allowed and appellant was acquitted while

connected criminal revision, of complainant was

dismissed vide our short order of even date. These are

the reasons for our short order, which is re-produced

herein below:-

“For the reasons to be recoded later,

the instant criminal appeal is
-23-

accepted, the impugned judgment of
conviction dated 26.06.2014, rendered
by learned Additional Sessions Judge,
Banda Daud Shah, Karak, is set-aside
and consequently appellant Alam Zar
Khan is acquitted of the charges
leveled against him. He be set at
liberty forthwith if not required in any
other case. While connected Cr.R
No.21-B/2014 titled “Haq Nawaz Vs

Alam Zar Khan, stands dismissed.”

Announced.
