JUDGMENT

Appellant(s)...(Imtiaz Ali): By Mr. Noor Alam Khan, Advocate.

Respondent(s)/State: By Mian Arshad Jan, AAG................02000

With

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Having been
convicted under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA, 1997,

the appellant, Imtiaz Ali, invoked the

appellate jurisdiction of this Court under
Section 410 Cr.PC read with Section 48
CNSA, thereby, assailing the judgment/order
dated 30.11.2016 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court-IX,

Peshawar, whereby, he was awarded
sentence of rigorous imprisonment for six
years, with fine of Rs.100000/- or in default of
payment of fine to further six months S.1;
while extending benefit of Section 382-B
Cr.PC to him; however, acquitting him of the
charge under Section 170 PPC.

2. The facts of the case as gleaned from
FIR No.630 dated 12.08.2015 under Sections
9 (c) CNSA and 170/419/420/468/471 PPC
P.S Regi, Peshawar, briefly stated, are that
while acting on a prior information about
smuggling of narcotics in black colour Honda
Motorcar No.368/ICT from tribal territory to
Punjab, Anmed Gul SHO/complainant along
with ASI Sadagat Khan, Shafique No.2914
and Sheher-Yar No.1344 laid barricade at
Tango stop near Kafoor Dehri Bridge, and
after some time, the said car arriving there
was stopped and driver of the car disclosed
his name as Imtiaz Ali, the
accused/appellant. According to the FIR,
keeping in view the prevailing situation, the

vehicle was taken to the police Station, where
the accused/appellant was interrogated in the
presence of Qisro Khan OIll, Mohib Gul SI and
Zahirullah MHC, and as aé_ —result of
interrogation, a plastic sack in a carton,
tagged on to bonnet of the vehicle above the
engine containing ten packets of heroin,
weighing one kg each, total ten kgs, was
recovered, and after the recovery, 1/1 gram
heroin was separated from each of the ten
packets and sealed in separate parcels for
chemical analyses in FSL while the remaining
heroin weighing 9990 grams was sealed in a
separate parcel No.11 on the spot. The
motorcar was taken into possession, and the
accused/appellant was _ arrested, who
reportedly, disclosed that the heroin belonged
to Nadar son of Qadar Khan resident of
Sangu Sarband, who had handed over the
same to him for delivery to one Javed resident
of Millat Chowk, Faisalabad. The personal
search of the accused/appellant also,
reportedly, led to the recovery of a card of

intelligence agency from his pocket which was
found fake on verification. The case/FIR was
registered and investigation was entrusted to
Qisro Khan OIl by the complainant/SHO.

3. The 1.0. prepared site plan of the place
of recovery as well as that of Police Station
Regi, Peshawar, where the motorcar was
searched and the alleged recovery was made
there-from. The samples in sealed parcels,
prepared after the alleged recovery, were sent
to the FSL, Peshawar, and report there-from
was received in the affirmative, confirming the
samples to be that of heroin. After proceeding
against the absconding co-accused, namely,
Nadar and Javed under Sections 204 and 87
Cr.PC, challan was submitted against them
under Section 512 Cr.PC; whereas complete
challan was submitted against the
appellant/accused facing trial; whereupon, the
learned trial Court/ASJ-IX/Judge, Special
Court, Peshawar, complied with the provision
of Section 265-C Cr.PC, in the first instance,
and then proceeded to frame formal charge

under Section 9 (c ) CNSA 1997 and Section
170 PPC against the accused/appellant, to
which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial.

4. In order to prove its case against the
appellant/accused, the prosecution produced
a total of four PWs, including, Ahmed Gul
Khan SHO/SI (PW.1), the seizing officer:
Mohib Gul Khan SI (PW2), marginal witness
to the recovery memo EXPW1/1; Izzatullah
constable No.3134, who took the samples to
the FSL; and Qisro Khan OII/|.0. (PW4). After
prosecution closed its evidence, statement of
the accused was recorded under Section 342
Cr.PC. In his statement, the
accused/appellant denied allegations of the
prosecution levelled against him, but declined
to be examined on oath or produce defence
evidence. Having heard arguments of learned
SPP for the State and learned counsel for
the accused/appellant, the learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Judge, Special Court-IX,
Peshawar, convicted the accused/appellant

under Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and sentenced
him to six years R.I and fine of Rs.100000/-
and in default of payment of fine to further six
months S.1; while acquitting him of the charge
under Section 170 PPC; hence the instant
appeal against conviction of the
appellant/accused and award of sentences to
him by the learned trial Court, as mentioned
hereinabove.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
appellant and learned AAG heard; and record

perused.

6. The most striking feature of this case
is that neither any recovery was made from
the motorcar at the place where the vehicle
was stopped by the complainant/SHO nor the
police officials present with the
complainant/SHO at that time, namely,
Sadaqat Khan ASI, Shafique No.2914 and
Sheher-Yar No.1344 were produced by the
prosecution as witnesses at least, to driving of
the vehicle by the appellant/accused, which

was stopped by them and then taken to the
police station on the usual pretext of
‘prevailing situation’; and instead Mohib Gul
Khan S.| (PW2) was produced as marginal
witness of the recovery memo (EXPW1/1). In
view of the fact that no recovery was made
from the motorcar after it was stopped for
checking, and the alleged recovery, if any,
made in the police station in the presence of
police officers other than those present with
the complainant/SHO at the time of stopping
of the vehicle at Tango stop near Kafoor
Dehri bridge, including even |.O. in the case
namely Qisro Khan, makes, the recovery and
case against the appellant/accused doubtful,
and testimony of the marginal witness (PW2)
not worthy of reliance in view of his own
admission that he was “not the eye witness of
the occurrence”. In the absence of
independent witnesses from the general
public inspite of prior information to the
complainant/SHO, and also non production of
police officers present with the

complainant/SHO at the relevant time who
could have, at least, proved the factum of
stoppage of the motorcar, driving of the same
by the appellant/accused and taking the
vehicle to the police station situated at a
distance of about six kilometers from the place
where the motorcar was_ stopped; but
withholding their testimony, certainly, cast
shadow of doubt on recovery of the
contraband from the car in the police station.
7. Apart from the alleged recovery in
questionable circumstances, the recovery of
ten packets containing ten kgs of heroin
tagged on to the bonnet of the motorcar over
the engine, and covering of considerable
distance by the vehicle, generating heat from
the engine, would also make the recovery
more doubtful, for the obvious reason of
heroin changing its very nature in the face of
so much heat.

8. The alleged recovery was made on
12.08.2015, but the samples separated from
the recovered packets and sealed on the spot

were received in the FSL for chemical
analysis after delay of five days on
17.08.2015, without any evidence proving
safe custody of the samples from the date of
recovery upto their receipt in the FSL; and
the only statement of Izzatullah constable
No.3134  (PW3), in this regard, further
compounded mystery about safe custody of
the samples during the intervening period,
who said that he did not remember the date
on which the samples were handed over to
him. Moreover, he admitted this fact that he
was not examined by the I.O under Section
161 Cr.PC. In other words, the non-provision
of a copy of his statement U/S 161 Cr.P.C to
the accused/appellant in compliance with the
mandatory provision of Section 265-(c)
Cr.P.C, deprived the appellant/accused of his
valuable right of preparing defence
accordingly.

9. Moreover, there is nothing on the
record to establish nexus of _ the
appellant/accused with the recovered

narcotics, as neither evidence was brought on
the record to show him either owner of the car
or its driver. In fact, nothing was brought on
the record to establish ownership of the car, or
to prove the appellant/accused as driver of the
motorcar.

10. The acquittal of the appellant/accused
under Section 170 PPC by the learned trial
Court, and non-filing of appeal by the State
against the order of acquittal, would not only
shake the very foundation of the case in the
shape of FIR but would also raise serious
question about case and evidence of the
prosecution against the appellant/accused.

11. In short, the prosecution failed to prove
recovery of the narcotics/heroin from the
possession of the accused/appellant, which
could have justified his conviction under
Section 9 ( c ) CNSA and award of six years
R.| and fine of Rs.100000/- to him. Therefore,
the appeal is accepted, and the judgment as
well as conviction of the appellant/accused
and sentences awarded to him by the learned

trial Court are set aside. The
accused/appellant is acquitted of the charges
and be set free, forthwith, if not required in

any other case.
