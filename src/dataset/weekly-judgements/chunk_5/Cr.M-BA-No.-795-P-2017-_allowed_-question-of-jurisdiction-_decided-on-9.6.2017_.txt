JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Cr.M/BA NO.795-P/2017
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing. 9.6.2017

Petitioner: (Mosam Khan) by Mr. Muhammad Shabbir Khan,
Advocate.

Respondents (The State and another) by M/s Talha Saeed
& Malik Misraf, Advocates.

WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J.- Accused-petitioner, | Mosam

Khan son of Rasheed Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No. 06 dated

8.1.2006 under Section 302/364/34 PPC registered at Police

Station Mattani, Peshawar. He has been refused bail by the

learned Additional Sessions Judge-XIV, Peshawar vide order

dated 12.4.2017; hence, the instant petition for the same

purpose.

2. Brief facts of the case are that father of the

complainant, namely, Muslim Khan was abducted on 6.11.2005

at 0900 AM by the petitioner along with his co-accused,

namely, Hassan Khan son of Rasheed Khan, Yaqoob Khan,

Saeed Khan sons of Abdul Hameed, Abdul Hameed son of Gul
Mir from the vicinity of Government High School Sherkera in

the presence of Shah Zaman son of Abdul Hanan & Zahid

Hussain son of Abdul Ghani and shifted him to tribal territory.

However, on the same day, the abductee was killed. Motive is

stated to be blood feud enmity. According to the complainant,

the dead body was discovered by the political authorities and

was brought to the village whereafter it was taken to the police

station for registration of FIR but the local police refused the

same; hence, he filed an application under Section 22-A Cr.P.C.

before competent court of law, which was allowed on 2.1.2006

and on basis of which, the instant F.I.R. was registered.

3. At the very outset, learned counsel for the

complainant raised objection that this Court has got no

jurisdiction to entertain the present bail petition because the

deceased was done to death in the tribal territory and the

accused-petitioner is required to approach the appropriate

forum for such a relief. To meet the objection, first, I would like

to reproduce Section 403 Cr.P.C., which reads as under:

“403. Persons once convicted or acquitted
not to be tried for the same offence. (1) A
person who has once been tried by a Court
of competent jurisdiction for an offence
and convicted or acquitted of such offence
shall, while such conviction or acquittal
remains in force, not to be liable to be tried

”

again for the same offence...........006 .

Similarly, this Court in the case of Munawar

Khan vs. Political Agent Khyber Agency Station and 4 others

(2012 MLD 503), has held that:

“Ss. 365/400/401/411—Frontier Crimes
Regulation, 1901, Ss. 11 & 48—Criminal
Procedure Code (V of 1898), Ss. 180 &
403---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 199 &
13---Constitutional _petition—Abducting,
belonging to gang of dacoits and
dishonestly receiving stolen property---
Jurisdiction of court---Double jeopardy---
Counsel for  petitioner/accused had
contended that as the case was registered at
Police Station at Peshawar, and according
to the F.LR. alleged abductee was abducted
from settled area, Assistant Political Agent
had no jurisdiction to try and convict
accused; that no person would be
prosecuted or punished for the same
offence more than once and that all
judgments under Frontier Crimes
Regulation as well as by Judicial
Magistrate Peshawar, be set aside and
accused acquitted of the charge---Validity--
-Alleged abductee_was_ abducted from _the
jurisdiction of Police Station at Peshawar;
and was recovered from _a place situated in

Tribal Areas falling within the jurisdiction
ty) Assistant __Political__ Agent---Both

Assistant Political Agency and Judicial
Magistrate Police Station Peshawar_had

the jurisdiction to try accused as provided
under_S. 180, Cr.P.C---Article 13 of the

Constitution provided that no person would
be prosecuted or punished for the same
offence more than once which had also
been provided under S. 403, Cr.P.C. —
Subsequent trial of accused person by
Judicial Magistrate Peshawar and _ his
judgment, were violative of Art. 13 of the
Constitution and S. 403, Cr.P.C. and were
of no legal consequence”.

In the instant case, co-accused of the petitioner,

namely, Saeed Khan & Abdul Hameed were tried by the

learned Additional Sessions Judge-VII, Peshawar and they were

acquitted vide judgment/order dated 26.2.2010, against which,

the complainant filed Cr.A. No. 291/2010 before this Court but

the same was also dismissed in limine vide order dated

3.2.2011. Moreover, another co-accused, namely, Muhammad

Yaqoob was also allowed bail by the learned Additional

Sessions Judge-III, Peshawar vide order dated 4.5.2012 and

against the said order, the complainant filed cancellation

petition before this Court, which too, was dismissed vide order

dated 15.2.2013, so keeping in view the above facts and

circumstances of the case and while taking guidance from the

judgment reported in 2012 MLD 503_ (referred above) along

with Section 403 Cr.P.C., this Court has the jurisdiction to

entertain the present bail petition; hence, the objection so raised

by the learned counsel for the complainant is overruled.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.
5. Without going into deep merits of the prosecution

case, suffice it to say, that five (05) persons have been charged

by the complainant for the murder of his father Muslim Khan

with no specific role, out of them, two were acquitted and one

was granted bail by the competent court of law, whose trial is

still pending. The case of present accused-petitioner is at par

with them and he deserves alike treatment. Besides, the

accused-petitioner, after arrest, remained in police custody but

no recovery or discovery has been made from him.

6. As far as the abscondance of accused-petitioner is

concerned, it has been settled law that mere abscondence is no

ground to decline the bail, if the case of an accused is otherwise

found fit for bail on merits and the bail cannot be refused even

if he had remained an absconder. Reliance can be placed on the

cases of State v. Malik Mukhtiar Ahmed (1991 SCMR 322)

and Mitho Pitafi_versus The State (2009 SCMR 299).

Accused-petitioner is behind the bars since 31.1.2017.

Investigation in the case is complete and the accused-petitioner

is no more required for further investigation and keeping him
behind the bars would serve no useful purpose, therefore, this

Court is inclined to extend the concession of bail to him.

7. In view of the above, this bail application is

accepted and the accused-petitioner is admitted to bail provided

he furnishes bail bond in the sum of Rs. 400,000/- (Rs. Four

lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure

that the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

8. Above are the reasons of my short order of even
date.

Announced. JUDGE
