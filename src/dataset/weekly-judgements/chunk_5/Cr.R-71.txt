CW-1/7. He has also produced record of the Civil
Suit No. 39/1 filed by petitioner on 20.02.2018 for

Zubair Shah, Head Teacher of G.P.S

according to her record i.e cs dale jiu, the date of

According to the said report, the present petitioner
was examined by Standing Medical Board on
20.12.2018 according to which the petitioner was
found to be more than 25 years of age. Section 7 of
the erstwhile Juvenile Justice “Ordinance, 2000
envisages for determination of the age of accused for
the purpose of the Ordinance as following.
7. Determination of age. If a question
arises as to whether a person before it is a
child for the purpose of this Ordinance, the
Juvenile Court shall record a finding after
such inquiry which shall include a medical
report for determination of the age of the
child”.
a The Close perusal of the above
provision of law would reveal that it envisages a

criterion regarding determination of age of a child

for the purpose of the Ordinance and one of the

considered materials is the medical report ie
Ossification Test. Thus, the legislature in its wisdom
has left open to the trial Court to determine the age
of the child accused by considering all the available
material on the record. In the case of “Nasib Ahmad
V/s. The State” PLD 2000 Supreme Court 813, the
august Supreme Court held that mere reliance on the
School Leaving Certificate by the Courts was not
enough to come to a definite conclusion as to the age
of the minor at the time of the commission of the
offence. Ossification Test or any other medical test
for that purpose should also be conducted, the age of
the accused be determined in accordance therewith
and then decide the case should be decided
accordingly.

In “Muhammad Akram V/s. Muhammad
Haleem alias Hamayun_and others” 2004 SCMR
218, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan when
found that the trial Court had conducted an inquiry
regarding juvenility of the accused without
conducting Ossification Test had remanded the case
to the trial Court for re-determining the age of the
accused afresh.

In the case of “Muhammad Zakir V/s.

the State and another” 2004 SCMR 121, the auigust

58: Mon‘ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
(Cr.R No. 71-M of 2019 Muhammad Kamal Vs. Jamshid Khon end one other}
-7-
Supreme Court had confirmed the order of the trial
Court where the age of the accused was determined
on the basis of Ossification Test excluding the date
of birth mentioned in the Schoo] Leaving Certificate.
In “Muhammad Aslam V/s. The State
and another” PLD 2009 Supreme Court 777, the
Hon’ble apex Court has laid down a detailed
guideline for the determination of the age of the
accused in Prara-11 of the judgment which is

reproduced as under:

“11. While we are on the subject, we consider it
necessary to re-iterate the principles regulating
the determination of age of accused persons vis-
a-vis their claim of minority and the procedure
to be followed for the purpose. The same are
summarized as under:---

(a) The normal penalty for an offence
punishable with death, is death, and in view
of the provisions of section 367(5), Cr.P.C.,
special reasons must exist to impose, on the
convict, a punishment other than a sentence
of death;

(b) the plea of minority by an accused is a
special plea intended to take the accused off
the noose and onus is thus on him to prove
the same;

(c) such a plea of minority must be taken by the
accused at the earlier possible opportunity,
preferably during the course of
investigation so that the requisite evidence
about the age of the accused could also be
properly collected during the said exercise
of collection of evidence and any delayed
claim on the said account should be met by
adverse inferences;,

(d) whenever such a question of age is raised or
arises at the trial, the courts should not

deal with the same in a cursory or in a slip-
shod manner but must proceed to hold an
inquiry in the matter as commanded by the
provisions of section 7 of the Juvenile
Justice System Ordinance including
medical examination of the accused for the
purpose;

(e) the said inquiry should not be understood to

(

mean only to entertain documents from
across the bar and then giving a decision
thereon. Such a practice needs not only to
be discouraged but, in fact, to be
discontinued. Basing judicial decisions on
untested and scrutinized documents was a
dangerous path to tread;

proper compliance of the said provisions of
section 7 would be to call upon the parties
to lead their evidence -- oral or
documentary in accordance with the
provisions of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order of
1984 with a right to the other party to test
the veracity or the genuineness of the same
in accordance with law and then to arrive
at a judicial decision in terms thereof;

(g) a medical examination of the accused person

could furnish a useful guideline in the
matter and should be resorted to; and
finally,

(h) we must always keep in mind that while it is

important, being a legal command, that a
"child" should not be sent to the gallows, it
is equally important that the one who
deserves death must not be allowed to
escape the same on the strength of false and
fabricated material.

In “OM Parkash VAs. State of Rajasthan

and another” 2012 SCMR 1400 the Indian Supreme

Court has held as following.

“Where the conduct of an accused or the method
and mannerism of the commission of the offence
indicated an evil and a well-planned design of
the accused, which indicated more towards the
mature skill of an accused than that of an

-9-
innocent child, then in the absence of reliable
documentary evidence in support of the age of
the accused, medical evidence indicating that the
accused was a major could not be allowed to be
ignored taking shelter of the principle of
benevolent legislation. Statutory protection of
the legislation on juvenile justice was meant for
a minor who was an innocent law breaker and
was not an accused having a mature mind who
used the plea of minority as a ploy or shield to
protect himself from the sentence of the offence
committed by him.

Zz By evaluating the evidence produced by
the parties in the light of the law laid down in the
afore-referred judgments, it is evident that the
present petitioner had applied for his CNIC which
was issued to him on 22.04.2010 wherein his date of
birth is recorded as 01.01.1991. The representative
of NADRA has also produced the Family Tree
Ex.CW-1/5 of Muhammad Idrees, father of the
petitioner, according to which Muhammad Idrees
has 4 sons and two daughters. The detail of dates of
birth of children of Muhammad Idrees mentioned in

the said Family Tree is as under:

Rahmatullh (son) 16.04.1985

Muhammad Arif (son) 28.09.1986

Falak Naz (daughter) 14.01.1990
Muhammad Kamal (son) (Petitioner) 01.01.1991
Muhammad Shahab (son) 08.03.1992

Kalsum Begum (daughter) 15.03.1999

Although the petitioner in support of his
age has produced ¢u& dsl juan), however, the same

register does not inspire confidence and cannot be

$8: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Syed Arshad All
{Cr.8 No. 72-4 of 2019 Muhommad Kamal Vs, Jamshid Khan and one other}
-10-
‘given preference over his age recorded in the
NADRA record. It would be pertinent to note that
the present petitioner himself had never claimed his
juvenility before the police at the time of
investigation nor during the trial. This fact was not
agitated even in appeal but was noticed by this Court
while deciding his appeal that there was an apparent
disparity in his date of birth which was recorded in
his charge-sheet and statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C being
one and the same. Thus, as an abundant caution the
case was remitted to the trial Court for determining

“the age of the petitioner. After remand of the case to
the trial Court, the petitioner had filed a civil suit for
correction of his date of birth which appears to have
been filed on the basis of mala fide. According to
Medical Report dated 11.01.2019, the petitioner is
more than 25 years of age. The date of birth
mentioned in the CNIC inspires more confidence
which was rightly considered by learned trial Court
for determination of his age.

&. In light of the above, the instant

revision petition having no merits is accordingly

dismissed.
