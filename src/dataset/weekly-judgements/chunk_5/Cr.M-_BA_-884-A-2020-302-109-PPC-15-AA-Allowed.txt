SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Petitioner, Mst. Safina Shah,
has approached this court for post arrest bail till final
conclusion of trial in Crime No. 1119 dated 03.08.2020
registered against her under Sections 302 / 109 PPC
read with section 15 AA KPK at Police Station City,
Haripur.

2. The allegation against the petitioner is that
she alongwith her co-accused Munir Khan, Raees,
Ahad Ali and Ihsan Ali committed murder of son of the
complainant namely, Wajid Ali, on 03.08.2020 at 09.45
hours near ‘Jahaz’ Chowk, Haripur by firing at him. She
was placed under arrest on 05.08.2020. Vide order

dated 28.08.2020, petitioner was declined post arrest
bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-l, Haripur,
hence, the instant petition.

3. Arguments heard. Record perused.

4. Admittedly, it is un-witnessed crime. The
complainant of the instant case has charged Mst.
Momina as an accused on the basis of disclosure made
to him by the employees of Rescue 1122. Perusal of
the statements of the said employees of Rescue 1122,
Hammad Mustafa and Shahid Khan reflect that when
they attended the deceased, then injured, Wajid Ali, he
was in senses and he disclosed them the name of the
accused Momina for causing him bullet injury. It is
observed that both of them had disclosed in their
statements that in the meanwhile two boys had arrived
at the spot, however, statements of Muhammad Farooq
and Muhammad Akram, who had arrived at the spot
stated in their statements recorded under section 161
Cr.P.C that the deceased, then injured, was not in a
position to talk. On 12.08.2020 supplementary
statement of the complainant was recorded by the I.O,
wherein, he disclosed that the actual name of Mst.
Momina is Safina Bibi Shah daughter of Mussawar
Hussain. No doubt, it was alleged that the crime pistol

was recovered from possession of the petitioner on
05.08.2020, it was sent to FSL alongwith crime empty
recovered from the spot and its report was received in
positive , however, | leave the evidentiary value of this
piece of evidence to be adjudged by the learned trial
Court after recording evidence of the prosecution.
5. At the moment, the tentative assessment of
the material available on record leads me to the
conclusion that the case of the petitioner squarely falls
within the ambit of subsection (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C,
thus, she has made out a case for grant of bail.
6. For what has been discussed above,
this petition is allowed and the petitioner is directed to
be released on bail provided she furnishes bail bonds in
the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two lakhs), with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa | Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that
the sureties are local, reliable and men of means.
Above are the detailed reasons for
short order of this Court of even date.
Announced:

Dt.12.10.2020.
