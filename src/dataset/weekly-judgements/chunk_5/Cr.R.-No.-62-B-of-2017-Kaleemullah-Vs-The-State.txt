*Imranullah* (S.B) Justice Shakeel Ahmad
4. Before resolving the controversy involved in the
revision petition, it will be advantageous to reproduce Section.
172 of the Cr.P.C and articles NO. 140, 155, 157 of Qanun-e-
Shahdat Order, 1984, as under:-

172. Diary of proceedings in investigation. (1) Every
police-officer making an investigation under this Chapter shall day by
day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, setting forth
the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he
began and closed his investigation, the place or places visited by him,
and a statement of the circumstances ascertained through his
investigation.

(2) Any Criminal Court, may send for the police-diaries of
a case under inquiry or trial in such Court, and may use such diaries
not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial.
Neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such
diaries, nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because
they are referred to by the Court; but if they are used by the police-
officer who made them, to refresh his memory, if the Court uses them
for the purpose of contradicting such police-officer the provisions of
the Evidence Act, 1872 section 161 section 145 as the case may be, shall

apply.

140. Cross-examination as to previous statements to
writing. A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements
made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to
matters in question, without such writing being shown to him, writing
- or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question without
such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is
intended to contract him by the writing, his attention must, before the
writing can be proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be
used or the purpose of contradicting him.

155. Refreshing memory. (1) A witness may, while
under examination, fresh his memory by referring to any writing
made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is
questioned, or soon afterwards that the Court considers it likely that
the transaction was at that time fresh in his memory.

(2) The witness may also refer to any such writing made by
any other person, and read by the witness within the time aforesaid, if
when he read it he knew it to be correct.

*Imranullah* (S.B) Justice Shakeel Anmad
(3) Whenever a witness may refresh his- memory by
reference to any document, he may with the permission of the Court,
refer to a copy of such document:

Provided the Court be satisfied that there is sufficient
reason for the non-production of the original.

(4) An expert may refresh his memory be reference to
professional treaties. ,

157. Right of adverse party as to writing used to
refresh memory. Any writing referred to under the provisions of the
two last preceding Articles muff, be produced and shown to the
adverse party if he requires it, such party, may, if he pleases,
cross-examine the witness thereupon.

5. Section. 172 Cr.P.C makes it mandatory to

investigating officer to enter day to day proceedings of the

investigation in a special diary, setting forth the time at which the

information reached him, the time at which he begun and closed

his investigation, the place or the places visited by him and

statement of the circumstances ascertained through his

investigation. Such special diary may be used at the trial or

inquiry not as evidence in the case, but to aid the Court in such

inquiry or trial. The object of Section 192(2) Cr.P.C is to enable

the Court to direct police officer who is giving his evidence to

refresh his memory from notes made by him in course of his

investigation of the case or to question him as to contradiction

*Imranullah* (S.B) Justice Shakeel Ahmad
which may appear between statement so recorded and evidence he

was giving in Court. Court may also use diaries in course of trial

for purpose of clearing up obscurities in evidence or bringing out

relevant facts which Court thought are material in interest of fair

trial. According to this section, the diary can be used for

suggestion of questions to witness when the Court considers that

there is reasonable ground for so doing or to suggest means for

further clarity by legal evidence, points that need clarification.

6. I.O not only occupies a key role in the criminal

justice system, but, also the most important witness, he is a person

who collects evidence and places the same before the Court. In

this behalf reference may be made to the case reported as Abdul

Sultan V The State through AG NWFP (2008 SCMR 684)

7. As discussed above, a police officer / I.O of the case

can refresh his memory before deposing before the Court and then

Article-140 of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984, confers a right upon

the accused to cross-examine the witness as to his previous

statement made by him in writing or reduced into writing.

*Imranullah* (S.B) Justice Shakeel Ahmad
8. In the instant case, Mutabar Khan 1.0, was under

cross-examination as PW-12 before the learned trial Court, there

is nothing on the record to show that he was examined without

consultation of police file, he himself admitted in the cross-

examination that “I have gone through the police file, and refresh

my memory and by now the police file is closed before me”.

9. It is now settled that once the I.O consulted the police

file he is amenable to cross-examination. If the diary is used by

the police officer to refresh his memory, the Provision of Article -

140 (Section. 161 of the Evidence Act) will apply and the adverse

party must be shown the entry and he may cross-examine the

witnesses on it, because the alternate object is to arrive at just and

proper decision of the case, even other-wise, there is no

prohibition against the Court permitting in its discretion, the

defence counsel to see the portion of the police diary, which the

Court considers fit in the interest of justice he should see and use

in the defence of the case. In this behalf reliance may be made on

the case reported in AIR 1953 Mad 179.

*Imranullah* (S.B) Justice Shakeel Ahmad
10. In view of the observations made hereinabove, this
revision petition is disposed off with direction to the learned trial
Court to allow the learned defence counsel to cross-examine the
PW-12 (1.0) of the case as provided by Section. 172 (2) Cr.P.C
and Article-157 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984, accordingly.

Announced.
