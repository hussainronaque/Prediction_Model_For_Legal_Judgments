SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J:-

Petitioner/complainant, Gul Muhammad, seeks
cancellation of bail granted to
accused/respondents, Amanullah, Faiz
Muhammad, Masoom Khan, Abdul Jabbar,
Sajid, Awais and Arshullah by the learned
Sessions Judge, Battagram, vide impugned
order dated 29.10.2016, in case F.I.R No.220
dated 14.09.2016 under sections 302/337-
F(v)/337-D/337-A(ii)/147/149 PPC Police

Station Chanjal, District Battagram.
2. The brief facts of the case against
the accused/respondents lodged on the report of
complainant/petitioner are that they alongwith
their co-accused have attacked the complainant
party and got them injured and later on one of
the injured namely Naseeb Khan succumbed to
his injuries. Accused/respondent, Muhammad
Awais has also charged the complainant party
in cross case registered vide FIR No.225 dated
14.09.2016. After arrest, both the parties
applied to the learned lower Court below for
grant of bail and their applications were
allowed.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that the bail granting order of the
learned lower Court below is illegal, perverse
and arbitrary and prayed for cancellation of bail
granted to the accused/respondent by accepting
the present Bail Cancellation Application.

4. On the other hand, learned counsel
for the accused/respondents has controverted

the arguments of the learned counsel for the
petitioner and argued that no illegality has been
committed by the learned lower Court below in
extending concession of bail to the
accused/respondents. Learned counsel for the
accused/respondents prayed for dismissal of the
present bail cancellation application filed by
the petitioner.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel
for the parties and learned AAG heard and
record of the case perused with their able
assistance.

6. Perusal of record of the case
reveals that the complainant has categorically
stated in the FIR that the deceased Naseeb
Khan was injured by accused/respondents Sajid
and Abdul Jabbar with sharp edged weapon.
However, it transpired from the medico-legal
report of injured Naseeb Khan that the weapon
used was blunt in nature. Moreover, the
injured eyewitnesses, Rasool Khan and
Muhammad Iqbal in their statements recorded

under sections 161 Cr.P.C, after about thirteen
days of occurrence on 27.09.2016, for the first
time introduced presence of axes with accused
Abdul Jabbar, Sajid, Faiz Muhammad and
Amanullah but the medico-legal report of the
injured Naseeb Khan is not supporting the
version of the complainant in the FIR and is
also contradictory to the statement of injured
PW Rasool Khan. In this view of the matter,
the learned lower Court below has neither
committed any illegality by allowing bail to the
present accused/respondents nor the impugned
order is arbitrary and perverse. Learned
counsel for the petitioner has not taken any
other ground for cancellation of the bail except
the one that the impugned order is illegal,
perverse and arbitrary. In view of the facts
discussed above, the case is not only of cross
version but in the present circumstances, it has
become a case of further inquiry in accordance
with the mandate of section 497(2) CR.P.C.

7. It is also well settled principle of

law that the considerations for the cancellation
of bail are altogether different from the
considerations for the grant of bail. In this
regard, this Court seeks guidance from
Muzaffar Iqbal’s case (2004 SCMR 231),
wherein, it has been held that:

“It is well-settled by now _ that
“considerations for the cancellation of bail
are different from the considerations for the
grant of bail. Section 497(1), Cr.P.C.
prohibits the grant of bail or offences
punishable with death or imprisonment of
10 years or over. Section 497(5), Cr.P.C
does not command the Court to cancel the
bail even when the offence is punishable
with death or imprisonment for life, and
even if the grant of bail is prohibited under
section 497(1), Cr.P.C the discretion is left
in the Court under section 497(5), Cr.P.C
which is pari materia with the principles
which apply to the setting aside of the orders
of acquittal.(Mian Dad vy. The State 1992
SCMR 1289).”

Reliance is also placed on case titled Habib-
ur-Rehman ete Vs. the State etc (2017
SCMR 274).

8. Keeping in view the above facts
and circumstances, this Court is of the
considered view that the bail granting order is
based on proper appreciation of the material
available on record of the case and there exists

no ground to cancel the bail granted to the
accused/respondents. Therefore, the instant
bail cancellation petition being bereft of merits

is dismissed.

Announced.
