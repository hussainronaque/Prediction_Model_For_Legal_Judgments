As per inquest report the dead body was identified by the

charged the accused-petitioner for the murder of her son.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the
parties heard and record perused with their assistance.

4, As per the accused-petitioner he acted in the
defence of his property. The learned counsel for petitioner
referred to section 103 PPC, for convenience same is
reproduced below:

“103. When the right of private
defence of property extends to causing
death.

The right of private defence of
property extends, under the restrictions
mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary
causing of death or of any other harm to
the wrongdoer, if the offence, the
committing of which, or the attempting to
commit which, occasions the exercise of
the right, be an offence of any of the
descriptions _ hereinafter enumerated,
namely:--

First. Robbery;

Secondly. House-breaking by night;

Thirdly. Mischief by fire committed
on any building, tent or vessels, which
building, tent or vessel is used as a human
3

dwelling or as a place for the custody of

property;

Fourthly. Theft, mischief or house-
trespass, under such circumstances as

may reasonably cause apprehension that

death or grievous hurt will be the

consequence, if such right of private

defence is not exercised.”

As per ibid section the right of private defence of
property extends to causing death in case of house-breaking
by night.

5. The occurrence took place at 1.00 am night.
Section 105 PPC is in respect of commencing and
continuance of the right of private defence of property,
according to which “ the right of private defence of
property against house-breaking by night continues as
long as the house-trespass which has been begun by such
house-breaking continues.”

6. The occurrence took place in the house of the
accused-petitioner and the dead body was found by the
police in the house of the petitioner. At present, it seems
that the petitioner acted in private defence of property,
hence he is entitled to the concession of bail. It will be seen
at the trial if he has exceeded this right. Let the prosecution
prove so, through cogent evidence.

7. For the reasons given herein above, the instant

Cr.Misc. BA No. 1322-P/2017 is accepted and the accused-

petitioner is allowed bail provided he furnishes bail bonds

8. The observations given by this court while
deciding bail application, are not to be considered during

shall not, in any manner, influence the trial Court, which is
free to apprise the evidence strictly in accordance with the
law and merits of the case.
