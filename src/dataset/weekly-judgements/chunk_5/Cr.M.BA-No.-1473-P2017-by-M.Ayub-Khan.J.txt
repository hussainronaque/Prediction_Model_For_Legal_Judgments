FIR
MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN J:- Jawad Khan son of
Sabz Ali Khan, petitioner herein, seeks bail in case FIR No.
99 dated 01.4.2017 registered under section 302-201-202-
109-34 PPC/ 512 Cr.PC at P.S Khanmai, District
Charsadda. |

2. On 31.3.2017, vide Mad No. 35 Noor Azam
Khan reported about the missing of his son namely, Aks
Noor. According to him Aks Noor ( his son) was residing
with him at Peshawar, who left the house at 9.00 am in his
car. He tried to contact him on his cell phone No. 0340-
0063090, but he could not get response. At 1400 hours he
was informed that the car of his son was parked near Wapda

Colony. He was not sure if his son had been kidnapped.
3. On 1.4.2017, Bahadar Khan S.I was informed
about the presence of a dead body in a canal. Nobody could
identify the dead body. The un-identified dead body was
sent to DHQ, Charsadda for Postmortem. As per report of
SI Bahadar Khan, FIR No. 99 dated 1.4.2017 under section
302-201-202-109-34 PPC was registered at P.S Khanmai,
Charsadda against unknown persons, showing the time of
occurrence as unknown as well.

4. The record shows that the dead body was
buried in the graveyard of Charsadda. On exhumation, on
2.4.2017 the dead body was identified by Noor Azam Khan
and was handed over to him. It is mentioned that the
process was completed without order of any Court.

5. On 30.4.2017, statement of Noor Azam was
recorded under section 164 Cr.PC. he charged the accused-
petitioner, his father and sister for the commission of the
offence. According to him, the sister of accused had

friendly relations with the deceased so he was done to

death.
6. Arguments heard and record perused.
7. Admittedly, there is no eye witness to the

occurrence. The cell phones of deceased and sister of the
accused-petitioner have not been taken into possession, so
as to ascertain any relation amongst them. As for as the

relationship ( if any) through the Facebook is concerned, the

C3.
same requires evidence. Besides the above, the assertion
that the deceased went missing on 31,3,2017 has not been
supported by the Postmortem report as in the PM report
dated 1.4.2017, probable time between death and
postmortem has been given approximately to be 3 to 4 days.
If it is believed that the deceased was done to death 3 to 4
days prior to 31.3.2017, then the missing date would be
27/28.3.2017. Another piece of circumstantial evidence is

the recovery of the alleged belongings of the deceased at the

pointation of the accused-petitioner, but the nature of

recovered articles is so, that its plantation cannot be ruled
out at this stage. It is case of circumstantial evidence and
requires further probe into the guilt of the accused-
petitioner. At present, the case of petitioner is open to
further inquiry, entitling him to the concession of bail. 2017
SCMR 728 may be relied in this regard.

8. For the reasons given herein above, the instant
Cr.Misc. BA No. 1473-P/2017 is accepted and the accused-
petitioner is allowed bail provided he furnishes bail bonds
in the sum-of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees Two Lac) with two
local, reliable and men of means sureties, each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of Ilaqa Judicial Magistrate/
MOD.

9. The observations given by this court while

deciding bail applications, are not to be considered during
the trial of the accused, which are tentative in nature and
shall not, in any manner, influence the trial Court, which is
free to apprise the evidence strictly in accordance with the
law and merits of the case.
