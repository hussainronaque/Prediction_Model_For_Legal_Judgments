Appellant-petitioner: By Muhammad Rashid Khan DIrma
Khel, Advocate.
Respondent: State By Shahid Hameed Qureshi, A.A.G alon

with Shah Hussain Khan, Advocate.

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.- This criminal appeal is

directed against the judgment dated 21.4.2014 of learned

Additional Sessions Judge-IJ, Bannu, delivered in case FIR

No.608 dated 21.11.2012 registered under Sections 302/324/34

PPC at Police Station Saddar, Bannu, whereby appellant

Shamroz Khan has been convicted and sentenced as under:-

Under Section 302(c) PPC.---To undergo
fourteen (14) years R.I alongwith compensation
of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lac), to be paid to
the legal heirs of the deceased in terms of Section
544-A Cr.PC, or in default thereof, to undergo
six months SI.

Benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC has been

extended to him.

Imran/*
2. Since the complainant has also filed

Cr.Rev.No.18-B/2014 for the enhancement of sentence and the

amount of compensation under Section 544-A Cr.PC, both these

matters, being the outcome of one and same trial, are to be

disposed of by way of this single judgment.

3. The prosecution case is that on 21.11.2012 at

0805 hours, complainant Nasibullah (PW-10) brought the dead

body of his brother Asmatullah to Civil Hospital, Bannu and

reported to the local police that on the eventful day at morning

time he alongwith Asmatullah started from the chowk of village

and when reached near their house, the appellant armed with

Kalashnikov and co-accused Latif armed with pistol were already

present there. It was about 0700 hours, when they reached near

them, both the accused started firing with their respective

weapons at them. Due to the firing of accused, Asmatullah got

hit, fell down and succumbed to the injuries on the way to the

hospital while the complainant escaped unhurt. After the

occurrence both the accused decamped from the spot. Motive for

the occurrence was stated to be a scuffle taken place between the

Imran/*
parties two days prior to the occurrence. Report of the

complainant was recorded in the shape of murasila Ex.PW-1/1

by Muhammad Ishaq ASI (PW-11). He also prepared injury

sheet Ex.PW-11/2 and inquest report Ex.PW-11/3 of the

deceased and shifted his dead body to the mortuary under the

escort of Constable Rast Ali No.1752 for postmortem

examination and sent the murasila to Police Station on the basis

of which FIR Ex.PA was registered against the appellant and his

acquitted co-accused Latif Khan.

4. Dr. Qazi Niaz-ud-Din, Medical Officer (PW-1),

conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased on

21.11.2012 at 09:45 a.m. and found the following injuries on his

person:-

1. One firearm entry wound 1/4" x 1/4” on the
posterior medial surface of the upper part of left
thigh.

2. One firearm exit wound on the antero lateral
surface of the upper part of the left thigh 1/2" x
1/2",

3. One firearm graze wound on the back of the right
thigh just below the lower border of the right
buttock 1” x 1”.

Imran/*
Thorax: Left femoral artery of the blood vessels
was injured (blood vessels were injured at the site of
injuries).

Muscles, bones and joints: Muscles were injured

at the site of injuries.

Opinion: According to the opinion of Medical
Officer, deceased died due to firearm injuries to left
femoral blood vessels leading to excessive bleeding
and death.

Probable time between injuries and death has been
given as 30 minutes to one hour while between

death and postmortem as 02 to 03 hours.

5. Shahbaz Khan S.I (PW-12) proceeded to the spot

and prepared site plan Ex.PW-12/1 on the pointation of

complainant. During spot inspection, he secured bloodstained

earth from the place of deceased and took into possession two

empties of Kalakov (Ex.P-1) giving fresh smell of discharge vide

recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1. He also took into possession

bloodstained shirt (P-2) and shalwar (P-3) belonging to deceased

vide recovery memo Ex.PW-2/2. Vide recovery memo Ex.PW-

2/3 he also took into possession one Kalakov bearing

No.81/803667 with fitted magazine (Ex.P-5) recovered from the

accused Shamroz in case FIR No.610. On 21.11.2012, the SHO

arrested accused Shamroz. He produced the accused before the

Imran/*
Court and obtained two days police custody vide his application

Ex.PW-12/2. On 24.11.2012, he produced the accused before the

Court where his confessional statement was recorded. He placed

on file the FSL and serologist report in respect of bloodstained

articles as Ex.PW-12/6. He also placed on file the FSL report in

respect of two empties and weapon of offence as Ex.PW-12/7.

6. On receipt of challan by learned trial Court, the

appellant and co-accused Latif Khan were formally charge

sheeted but they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. To bring

home the guilt of the accused, prosecution produced as many as

thirteen (13) PWs. After closure of prosecution evidence,

statements of accused were recorded under Section 342 Cr.PC

wherein they refuted the allegations levelled against them.

However, they neither wished to be examined on Oath as

required under Section 340(2) Cr.PC nor wanted to produce

evidence in their defence and thus, the trial culminated into

acquittal of co-accused Latif Khan and conviction of the

appellant, who was sentenced as above, hence, he filed

Cr.A.No.63-B/2014 while the complainant filed Cr.Rev.No.18-

B/2014.

Imran/*
7. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the

appellant is innocent and has been falsely roped in the case; that

the complainant has charged the appellant alongwith his co-

accused Latif Khan but during investigation co-accused was

found innocent and he was acquitted and the appeal against his

acquittal has already been dismissed by this Court, therefore, on

the basis of same set of evidence, the appellant also deserves

acquittal as the statement of the complainant is not confidence

inspiring; that the impugned judgment is the result of mis-

appreciation and non-appreciation of evidence available on

record; that the learned trial Court has not appreciated the

evidence in its true perspective and thus has arrived at a wrong

conclusion in the shape of impugned judgment; that the

prosecution case is full of doubts and conviction cannot be based

on such sketchy and shaky evidence; that the recoveries were

planted against the appellant and dubiously procured; that

confessional statement of the appellant is neither true nor

voluntary being retracted before commencement of the trial.

Thus, he requested that the impugned judgment be set aside and

the appellant be acquitted of the charge levelled against him.

Imran/*
8. On the contrary, learned Addl: A.G. for the State

assisted by private counsel for the complainant argued that the

complainant directly charged the appellant for effective role of

firing at his deceased brother Asmatullah. The recovery of crime

weapon from the appellant and the positive report of empties

recovered from the spot fully connect him with the commission

of offence. They further argued that after arrest of the appellant,

he recorded confessional statement before the competent Court

of law wherein he admitted the commission of offence, therefore,

he does not deserve any leniency and requested for enhancement

of sentence awarded to the appellant.

9. We have heard the arguments of learned counsel

for the parties as well as learned Addl: A.G. for the State and

have gone through the record with their able assistance.

10. The appellant was arrested on 21.12.2012. On

24.11.2012, he was produced before the learned Judicial

Magistrate-VI, Bannu (PW-9), where he confessed his guilt by

mentioning in detail the reason of murder of the deceased as

below:-

11. In this case the substantive piece of evidence

with the prosecution relied upon is confessional statement of the

appellant. From perusal of the same it transpires that the same is

voluntary and according to the narration of the occurrence

because the appellant had disclosed such facts which otherwise

were neither known to the complainant nor to the investigating

officer that the deceased made him annoyed by saying that he

was having illicit liaison with his nephews, thus, in such

circumstances the confessional statement has rightly been

believed by the learned trial Court.

13. The contention of learned counsel for the

appellant is that the confessional statement was retracted soon

before commencement of trial. This Court is of the view that

even conviction can be based on retracted judicial confession

provided it is true and voluntary and corroborated by some strong

piece of independent evidence. In this case the confession of the

appellant was recorded not only in accordance with Sections

164/364 Cr.PC but also in accordance with the provisions of

High Court Rules and Orders.

Imran/*
10

14. It is well embedded principle of the criminal

justice that when there is no other evidence then the confession

or for that matter the statement of the accused is to be taken in

totality. The Court is not left with any choice but to take into

consideration the same in toto. It is clear than crystal from the

confessional statement of the appellant that it was not a

premeditated murder and the occurrence took place in the heat of

passions when the appellant became annoyed due to the act of

deceased. Wisdom in this respect is derived from the case law

reported as 1994 SCMR titled, “Naseer Husain Vs. Nawaz and

others” where the following view was taken by Apex Court:-

“Learned counsel has pointed out that
the conviction of the petitioner and the
sentence imposed on him by the
learned trial Court rests only on his
own statement where he admitted
having caused the death of Ghulam
Sarwar deceased and explained the
circumstances in which the incident
occurred. His plea, in short, was that
he had caused the death of Ghulam
Sarwar under grave and sudden

provocation.

Imran/*
11

It is submitted that the High Court in
enhancing the sentence has accepted
that part of the statement in which he
inculpated himself but rejected the
other part thereof which showed that
the act was committed under grave
and sudden provocation. The
contention is that if the conviction of
the accused is founded on his own
statement it has to be accepted in toto

or not at all”

15. Besides the above, in case titled, “Ghulam Nabi
Vs. The State” reported as 2007 SCMR 808, the Apex Court has

held as under:-

“The Magistrate who recorded the
confessional statement of the petitioner
has categorically stated that he
recorded the confessional statement of
the accused after completion of all
formalities and providing sufficient
time to him to think over the matter
before making the confession. The
perusal of statement of the witnesses
together with the statement of the
petitioner would suggest that there was
no element of coercion, undue
influence or pressure rather the record
shows that confession was made

voluntarily and was truthful. The mere

Imran/*
12

fact that confessional statement was
made on the last day of physical
remand would not be indicative of any
doubt regarding its voluntariness to
exclude it from consideration, instead it
would ensure its voluntariness because
petitioner was aware of the fact that he
would not be again given in the custody
of police and was being sent to the

judicial custody. ”.

16. During spot inspection, PW-12 Shahbaz Khan
S.I recovered two empties of Kalakov (Ex.P-1) from the place of
occurrence vide recovery memo Ex.PW-2/1. On 21.11.2012, the
appellant was arrested and one Kalakov bearing No.81-803667
(Ex.P-4) was recovered from him which was taken into
possession through recovery memo Ex.PW-2/3. The recovered
empties (Ex.P-1) and the Kalakov (Ex.P-4) were sent to the FSL
and according to report (Ex.PW-12/7) of Fire Arms Expert
“Microscopic examination of the case has revealed that the two
222 bore crime empties marked C1 and C2 were fired from 222
bore rifle No.81-803667 in question, in view of the following
major points i.e. striker pin marks, breach face marks, etc are
similar. The rifle in question is foreign made and working
condition”. So the recovery of Kalakov and positive report of
Fire Arms Expert duly corroborate the confessional statement of

the appellant.

Imran/*
13

17. Though the medical evidence does not identify
the culprits but it shows that the deceased received two firearms
injuries, therefore, same also corroborates the confessional
statement of the appellant wherein he stated that he fired two
shots at the deceased.

18. In view of facts and circumstances narrated

above, the learned trial Court rightly held that it was a case of

grave and sudden provocation and accordingly convicted and

sentenced the appellant under section 302(c) PPC. The

complainant has also filed Cr.Rev.No.18-B/2014 for

enhancement of sentence of the appellant to death and the

amount of compensation. As we have held that the learned trial

Court has rightly held the instant case of grave and sudden

provocation, therefore, the sentence awarded to the appellant is

sufficient to meet the ends of justice and that too when the

deceased received fatal firearm injury on upper part of left thigh

i.e. non-vital part of his body. Thus we see no justification in

enhancing the sentence of the appellant. The impugned judgment

is well reasoned, in accordance with law and needs no

Imran/*
14
interference, therefore, the same is upheld. Consequently, both
the appeal and the revision are hereby dismissed.
