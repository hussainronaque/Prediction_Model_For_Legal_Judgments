2500-P, 1169-P, 1174-P of 2015 respectively), have sought

16.09.2014 in Police Station CTD, Mardan while Attaur
-2-

Rehman (petitioner in W.P.No.2237-P/2015) has sought his
release on bail in a case registered against him and others
under Sections 324 / 353 / 148 / 149, PPC / Section 15 of the
Arms Act, 2013 / Section 4 / 5 of the Explosive Substances
Act, 1908 read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997
and Section 15 of the Protection of Pakistan Ordinance, vide

FIR No.09, dated 21.01.2015 in Police Station CTD, Mardan.

2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners vehemently argued that the alleged occurrence took
place at midnight / odd hours, having no independent
eyewitness; that neither the petitioners have directly been
charged in the FIR nor were arrested on the spot rather later on
were falsely implicated in the instant cases only on a Source
report dated 21.09.2014; that petitioners namely, Khairul
Akbar and Wagif Ali and co-accused Saddam were arrested
after thirteen days of the alleged occurrence and after twenty-
seven days of the same, the identification parade had been
conducted; that petitioners namely, Zakir Ali and Salim, who
were arrested later on, were not even identified in the
identification parade; that such like identifications, which
were conducted much after the arrest of the accused, as per
settled view of the apex Court, have no legal sanctity, as such,
cannot be relied upon / believed; that in the alleged Source

report, petitioners namely, Zakir Ali, Noorul Amin and Salim
3-

were not nominated, whereas, the petitioners namely, Waqif
Ali and Kahirul Akbar were, though, nominated therein and,
on whose pointation, the alleged addition has been made in the
site plan but, interestingly, even in that, their names were not
mentioned anywhere; that nothing incriminating has been
recovered from any of the petitioners; that they have not made
any confessional statement despite being remained in custody;
that petitioners namely, Waqif Ali and Khairul Akbar are
below the age of eighteen years and, as per Juvenile Justice
System Ordinance, 2000, they are otherwise entitled to be
released on bail; that no specific role has been attributed to
any of the petitioners; that except one, all the petitioners are
behind the bars since long, yet the commencement of their
trial let alone its conclusion is not in sight, that too, when
despite lapse of sufficient long time, even the Federal
Government has failed to constitute the Courts to try them,
notwithstanding, the challan has since been completed; that
they are neither hardened, desperate or dangerous criminals
nor previous convicts in such like criminal cases nor there is
anything in black and white that they belong to any banned
organization or threatened the security of Pakistan, as such,
provisions of Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014 are not
applicable to the instant cases; that under Section 5 of the
Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014, a Joint Investigation Team

was supposed to conduct investigation but, in the instant
-4-

matters, no Joint Investigation Team was constituted rather the
entire investigation has been conducted by a Sub-Inspector,
who, under this Act, was not competent, as such, the entire
superstructure based on the strength of such like void and
illegal investigation, would automatically, crumble down like
house of cards; that the alleged occurrence vide FIR No.01
had been committed much prior to twenty-first amendment of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and no
retrospective effect has been given in this regard; that the case
of the petitioners does not fall under Section 2(1) (iii) of the
Army Act, 1952; that the co-accused namely, Naveed Hussain,
Magsood and Farooq having identical role have already been
released on bail vide judgments dated 05.03.2015 and
10.06.2015 respectively, hence, they are otherwise, entitled to
be released on bail on the principle of consistency,
notwithstanding, merits of the case. The learned counsel for
petitioner namely, Noorul Amin further submitted that since
he has been involved in the case on the strength of statement
of co-accused, who has also been granted bail by this Court,
his ad-interim pre-arrest bail, in the present scenario, is
required to be confirmed. All the learned counsel for the
petitioners in support of their arguments placed reliance on the

cases of Muhammad Afzal alias Abdullah & others vs.

State (2009 SCMR 436); Bacha Zeb vs. State (2010 SCMR
1189); Shafgat Mehmood vs. State (2011 SCMR_ 537);
-5-
Sabir Ali alias Fauji vs. State (2011 SCMR 563); Nazir

Ahmad vs. Muhammad Iqbal (2011 SCMR 527).

3. So far as the maintainability of the instant writ
petitions is concerned, the learned counsel for the petitioners
by arguing the case in this regard submitted that under Article
245(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973, though, High Court cannot exercise its jurisdiction
under Article 199 of the Constitution, where the Armed Forces
of Pakistan, for the time being, acting in aid of civil power but
the area, where, the alleged occurrence has taken place or the
petitioners arrested, was settled one and the Armed Forces
were not called for or deputed under Article 245 of the
Constitution, therefore, this Court has the ample power to
adjudicate upon such like matters under Article 199 of the
Constitution and even can grant bail to the petitioners in the
light of dicta, rendered by the apex Court in Asfand Yar
Wali’s case, that too, when except filing petition under Article
199 of the Contrition, no other remedy in the shape of
Sections 374, 426, 435, 439, 439A, 491, 496, 497, 498 and
561A of the Cr.PC is available to the petitioners as envisaged
under Section 18 of the Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014,
hence, these writ petitions are maintainable and can well be
heard and decided by the Division Bench of this Court. Placed

reliance on the cases of District Bar Association,
-6-

Rawalpindi vs. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2015 SC 401)
Citations (ww) and (ccc) and Khan Asfandyar Wali &
others vs. Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2001 SC
607).

4. As against that the learned Additional Advocate
General appearing on behalf of the State by opposing the grant
of bail to the petitioners submitted that concession of bail
cannot be granted on basis of hypothetical and presumptive
arguments as the petitioners, after due satisfaction and
identification test, have been nominated in the instant cases;
that petitioners Waqif Ali, Kahirul Akbar and co-accused
Saddam are also involved in another case vide FIR No.12
dated 30.09.2014 of similar nature; that petitioner Attaur
Rehman has directly been charged in the FIR, who after the
occurrence decamped from the spot and all the petitioners are
interlinked and in league with each other and till date, they
have failed to allege any mala fide on the part of the police for
their false involvement in the instant cases and since, they are
involved in heinous offences / crimes, they do not deserve the

concession of bail, at least, at this stage.

5. The learned Deputy Attorney General appearing
on behalf of the Federation, in support of the arguments of the
learned Additional Advocate General, submitted that as per

amendment made in Section 2 of the Army Act on 19.11.2015,
-7-

the arrest and detention, much prior to the twenty-first
amendment, has been given protection with retrospective
effect and the Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014 has been
inserted in the First Schedule through twenty-first amendment,
the crime committed there-under being Scheduled offence, as
such, Article 8(1)(2) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan would not be applicable to the case of the petitioners.
On query qua submission of complete challan before the Court
of competent jurisdiction, the learned DAG submitted that the
Federal Government under Section 12 of the Protection of
Pakistan Act, 2014 has appointed Prosecutor General but so
far as functioning of Trial Courts for those matters is
concerned, those have not yet been constituted and made
functional. In the end, he has requested for the dismissal of the

instant writ petitions.

6. Arguments of both the parties were heard

carefully and record of the case was perused.

7. First of all, we would like to tackle the question
of maintainability of the instant writ petitions. As per Section
18 of the Protection of Pakistan Act, 2014, provisions of
Sections 374, 426, 435, 439, 439A, 491, 496, 497, 498 and
561A of the Cr.PC are not applicable to the Act, ibid., but, at
the same time, we see that there is no legal bar to seek bail

through a petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution
-8-

of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and, that’s why, the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while facing with similar

situation in NAB case in Khan Asfandyar Wali & others vs.

Federation of Pakistan and others (Supra) held in the

following manner:-

(1) National Accountability Bureau

Ordinance (XVIII of 1999)---

----S.9(b)---Constitution of Pakistan (1973),
Art. 184(3)---Constitutional petition under
Art. 184(3) of the Constitution before
Supreme Court---Vires of National
Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999---
Provision of S.9(b) of the Ordinance purports
to deny to all Courts, including the High
Courts, the jurisdiction under Ss:426, 491,
497, 498 & 561-A, Cr.P.C. or any other law
for the time being in force, to grant bail to any
person accused of an offence under the
Ordinance---Validity---Superior Courts have
the power to grant bail under Art.199 of the
Constitution, independent of any statutory
source of jurisdiction such as S.497, Cr.P.C.--
-Section 9(b), National Accountability Bureau
Ordinance, 1999, to that extent is ultra vires
the Constitution and the same is to be suitably

amended accordingly.

The superior Courts under Article 199 of
the Constitution "remain available to their full
extent....notwithstanding anything contained

in any legislative instrument enacted by the
-9-

Chief Executive": Whereas, section 9(b) of the
National Accountability Bureau Ordinance,
1999 purports to deny to all Courts, including
the High Courts, the jurisdiction under
sections 426, 491, 497, 498 and 561A or any
other provision of the Code of Criminal
Procedure or any other law for the time being
in force, to grant bail to any person accused
of an offence under the National
Accountability Bureau Ordinance. The
superior Courts have the power to grant bail
under Article 199 of the Constitution,
independent of any statutory source of
jurisdiction such as section 497 of the
Criminal Procedure Code. Section 9(b) of the
Ordinance to that extent is ultra vires the
Constitution. Accordingly, the same be

amended suitably.

So, in view of the above referred citation and by taking
guideline there-from, we can safely say that these writ
petitions being petitions for bail in substance are maintainable
as the petitioners have no other remedy to seek bail under the

Criminal Procedure Code.

8. The record of the case would reveal that the
petitioners alongwith others were arrested in the cases on the
allegations that they have attacked at the police post and at the
police party, for which, they were booked in two different

FIRs vide No.01, dated 16.09.2014 and No.09, dated
-10-

21.01.2015, mentioned above. The co-accused namely,
Naveed Hussain, involved in FIR No.01, dated 16.09.2014,
though first applied to the Anti-Terrorism Court concerned for
his release on bail but due to lack of jurisdiction, he
approached this Court through Writ Petition No.94-P/2015,
which was allowed and he was granted bail by this Court vide
judgment dated 05.03.2015. Likewise, the other co-accused
namely, Maqsood and Farooq, involved in FIR No.09, dated
21.01.2015 also filed Writ Petition No.765-P/2015, who were
also released on bail by this Court vide judgment dated
10.06.2015. Similarly, petitioner namely, Noorul Amin also
applied for ad-interim pre-arrest bail, which was accordingly
granted to him by this Court vide order dated 10.07.2015 and

today, his case is fixed for confirmation.

9. The record would further reveal that though in
FIR No.01, dated 16.09.2014, the petitioners herein, were not
directly charged / nominated but, later on, on a source report,
they were implicated in the instant case. On 13.10.2014, the
learned Judicial Magistrate, Mardan, had conducted the
identification parade, through which, petitioners namely,
Khairul Akbar and Wagqif Ali besides co-accused Sadam were
correctly identified by the witness. So, it is not a universal rule
that, an accused, who has committed the crime but is not

charged in the promptly lodged report or not arrested on the
-11-

spot cannot be implicated later on, despite having sufficient
material against him and since, in the instant case, the
petitioners of FIR No.01 have been implicated on account of
source report, based on some solid incriminating evidence
against them, would not be in a position to take shelter under
the umbrella of technicalities as they have not directly been
charged in the FIR. So far as, the petitioner of FIR No.09 is
concemed, he has directly been charged for committing the

crime and decamping thereafter from the spot.

10. Now comes the questions that the co-accused of
the petitioners, named above, were granted bail by this Court,
whether the present petitioners are also entitled to be released
on bail on the principle of consistency and whether the FIR
No.01 dated 16.09.2014, lodged for the offence / occurrence,
committed much prior to twenty-first amendment, has been
given any retrospective effect. Yes, the occurrence took place
prior to twenty-first amendment and till filing of the petitions
of the co-accused as well as the instant ones, no protection
was given to the actions with regard to the arrest of an accused
prior to commencing of Pakistan Army (Amendment) Act,
2015 but, in the month of November, 2015, on 19.11.2015,
certain more amendments have been made in the Pakistan

Army Act, 1952. It would be worthwhile to reproduce herein
-12-

below the relevant portion of the said amendments, which read
as under:-

2. Amendment of section 2, Act XXXIX of
1952.-In the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (XXXIX
of 1952).-

(a) in section 2, in sub-section (I), in
clause (d), in sub-clause (iv), in the
second proviso, for the full stop at the end
a colon shall be substituted and after the
second proviso amended as aforesaid the
following new proviso shall be added,

namely: --

"Provided further that
notwithstanding anything contained
in this Act or any other law for the
time being in force, any person
arrested, detained or held in custody
by the armed forces, civil armed
forces or law enforcement agencies
and kept under arrest, custody or
detention before the coming into
force of the Pakistan Army
(Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act Il of
2015) shall be deemed to have been
arrested or detained pursuant to the
provisions of this Act as amended by
the Pakistan Army (Amendment)
Act, 2015 (Act II of 2015) if the
offence in respect of which such

arrest or detention was made also
-13-

constitutes an offence referred to in

sub-clause(iii) or sub-clause (iv):
The above quoted amendment would reveal that a proper
protection has been given to the actions, which were done
prior to twenty-first amendment and the co-accused have been
granted bail before that amendment, so, in the present
scenario, neither the principle of consistency would be
attractive to the case of the present petitioners nor they can
claim that no retrospective effect was given to the FIR No.01,

lodged before twenty-first amendment.

11. Besides the above legal impediments, the other
material, available on the record, goes against the present
petitioners, that too, when they were unable to establish any
mala fide or grudge on the part of the police qua their false
involvement in the instant cases and the offences, for which
they are charged with, being Scheduled offences, as such,
Article 8(1)(2) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan would not be applicable to their case and they being,
prima facie, connected with the crime, attracting prohibitory
clause, do not deserve the concession of bail, at-least, at this
stage. Though the learned counsel for the petitioners tried their
level best to make out a case for concession of bail through
their elaborate arguments but, in our opinion, they could not

succeed in their efforts. Even otherwise, none of the
-14-

contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners
can be appreciated without deeper appreciation of evidence,
which, we, while hearing petitions under Article 199 of the
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in
substance bail petitions, cannot be considered. The judgments,
so referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioners, in the
present scenario, would not be helpful to the petitioners. The
arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners qua
deficiencies in the investigation of the cases cannot be

considered, at-least, at this stage of the case.

12. For the reasons discussed above, these petitions
being without substance are dismissed while the order dated
10.07.2015 of this Court qua granting ad-interim pre-arrest

bail to petitioner Noorul Amin, is hereby recalled.

13. Before parting with the judgment, we have
observed with great concern that, after the registration of both
the FIRs bearing No.01 and 09, the Special Court has not been
made functional and even a senior District and Sessions Judge
has been posted by this Court for the purpose on the request of
the Federal Government. We, in the circumstances of the case,
would like to advice the Federal Government through its
Secretaries Defence and Law to take necessary measures /
arrangements to make the Special Court functional, so that the

petitioners as well as the other co-accused of such like
-15-

offences could be tried and prosecuted without wasting any
further time. We expect that the needful shall be done by the
Government as early as possible but not later than two months,
after the receipt of this judgment, failing which, the petitioners
would be at liberty to seek their appropriate relief provided
under the law. Copies of this judgment be sent to the Federal
Government through its Secretaries, mentioned above, for
information and strict compliance.

Announced.
