JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 25.06.2020
Petitioner(s) by: Mr. Ishfaq Ahmad Afridi, Advocate

Respondent(s) by: Mr. Rab Nawaz Khan, Addl: AG

IKRAMULLAH KHAN, J.- Through the instant writ

petition, petitioner has challenged the act of police officer
(1.0), who had placed the name of respondents in column
No.2 of the police report, submitted under Section 173
Cr.P.C before the Judicial Magistrate for taking cognizance
of the offence.

2. In essence, petitioner/complainant is the brother of

the deceased Ameer Rehman s/o Malik Aman. That on
20.07.2019 was murdered by respondents No.1 to 3 and to
this effect FIR No.491 was lodged under sections
302/324/449/34 PPC dated 20.07.2019 in Police Station
Katlang. On 13.08.2019 complete challan was submitted in
the Court of learned Additional Session Judge, Mardan. Ad-

interim bail of respondent No.1 was recalled on 20.07.2019,
while ad-interim bail of respondent No.2 was recalled on
10.08.2019. Thereafter accused-respondent No.1 applied for
post arrest bail before learned Additional Session Judge,
Katlang Mardan which was dismissed on 10.08.2019, while
the post arrest bail petition of the respondent No.2 was
turned down by learned Additional Session Judge vide order
dated 30.08.2019. On 31.07.2019 accused-respondent
applied for re-investigation, respondent No.5 submitted
complete challan, in which the accused-respondents were
declared as accused after impartial investigation by the
investigation officer of the concerned police station. The
accused-respondents again approached to the Crime Branch
to re-investigation after the delay of almost 08 months, in
which the accused-respondents except the absconding
accused were put into column No.2 of the challan, vide

order dated 20.05.2020, hence this petition.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner contended that

respondents No. 1 and 2, had committed Qatl-e-Amd,
charged under Section 302 PPC, whose post arrest bail had
also declined by this Court, but the official respondents
have placed their names in column No.2 of the police
report, whereby they were declared as innocent which is

against law and facts on record.
4. We heard learned counsel for the petitioner and have

gone through the available record.

5. The record reveals that on account of re-investigation

of the case, on application of accused/respondents, the
concern SHO in view of the re-investigation has placed the
names of respondents in column No.2 of its report
submitted under Section 173 Cr.PC on 20.05.2020 before
the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, whereby both the
accused/respondents were declared as innocent.

6. No doubt, the police have placed the names of

accused/respondents in column No.2, on account of
deficient evidence, however, they were not discharged
under Section 169 Cr.PC by the concern SHO. The report
under Section 173 Cr.PC, be placed before Magistrate
concern, who in view of Section 190 (2) Cr.PC would send
the case before the Court of Session.

7. It would be the Court of Session to take cognizance

of the offence, and once cognizance is taken up in an
offence, then the Court of Session could issue process
against any person prima facie found concerned in the
commission of offence, notwithstanding the fact that such
person is exonerated or his name is not mentioned in the

police report or is placed in column No.2 of the report, as
police are not the final arbiter and it would be the Court to
decide finally who should or who should not be tried.
Reliance in this regard may be placed on Chaudhry
Muhammad Bashir vs Mirza Wahid Muhammad Baig

and another (PLD 2008 Karachi 280).
8. As the matter has to be resolved by the learned trial

Court, while, the learned trial Court is not bound to accept
the ipse-dixit of police, therefore, this Court could not
intervene at this preliminary stage, either to hold a person
accused or innocent. This petition being pre-mature,
dismissed accordingly, however, petitioner would be at
liberty to agitate his grievance, if not satisfied by the order
of learned trial Court before competent Court of law in

accordance with principles of criminal law thereof.
