NAIMATULLAH PHULPOTO, J.- Applicant /accused

Ghulam Sarwar alias Qali Jatoi seeks post arrest bail in crime

No.05/2013, registered against the accused on 18.01.2013, at Police
Station Rustam, District Shikarpur, under Section 9(c) of the Control
of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997.

2. Brief facts of the prosecution case as disclosed in the
F.ILR are that on 18.1.2013 SIP Abdul Jabbar Kolachi of PS Rustam
left police station alongwith his subordinate staff for patrolling
duty. He received spy information that applicant/accused Ghulam
Sarwar alias Qali, by caste Jatoi, was carrying a black-coloured bag
containing charas and was standing at Faizoo Larro to catch a
bus. On such information, police party proceeded to the pointed place
and reached there at 1500 hours. Applicant while seeing the police
party tried to run away but he was surrounded and caught
hold. Private mashirs were not available, sub-inspector made HC
Abdul Raheem Bhutto and PC Muhammad Saleh Bhayo as
mashirs. Applicant/accused disclosed his name as Ghulam Sarwar

alias Qali son of Abdul Majeed, by caste Dodani Jatoi, resident of
Village Ali Hassan Jatoi, Taluka Khanpur. Plastic bag was recovered
from his possession, it contained pieces of the charas. Pieces of the
charas were weighed, charas was total 1100 grams. Mashirnama of
arrest and recovery was prepared in presence of mashirs, property
was sealed, accused and the case property were brought at police
station, where sub-inspector lodged the F.I.R against the accused on
behalf of State under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997. Charas was sent to the Chemical Examiner for
analysis and report. After usual investigation challan was submitted

before competent Court of law under the above referred Section.

3. Bail application on behalf of the applicant/accused was
moved before the learned Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Narcotics,

Shikarpur, it was dismissed by order dated 25.6.2013.

4. Mr. Azhar Hussain Abbasi, learned advocate for the
applicant/accused mainly contended that yet it is to be determined at
trial whether offence would fall under Section (c) or 9(b) of the Control
of Narcotic Substances Act. He has further submitted that the
quantum of sentence has to be commensurate with the quantum of
substance recovered. Mr. Azhar Hussain argued that
applicant/accused is in custody since last 06 months and charas has
been foisted upon the accused by the police due to enmity. In support
of the contentions he relied upon the case of Jamal-ud-Din alias Zubair
Khan v. The State,2012 SCMR 573 and Criminal Bail Application
No.S-71/2013 decided by this Court dated 09.5.2013.
5. Miss Shazia Surahio, learned State Counsel, opposed bail
application on the ground that 1100 grams of the charas have been
recovered from the accused and offence under Section 9(c), C.N.S Act,
1997 is punishable for death or imprisonment for life, or

imprisonment for a term which may extend to fourteen years with fine.

6. I am inclined to grant bail to the applicant/accused for
the reasons that quantum of the sentence has to be commensurate
with the quantum of the substance recovered, I doubt in above stated
facts the applicant/accused can be awarded maximum sentence
provided by the statute. The Court while deciding the bail application
is not to keep in view the maximum sentence provided by the statute
but the one which is likely to be entailed in the facts and
circumstances of the case. In this case 1100 grams charas have been
recovered from the accused. Obviously it is borderline case. Yet it is
to be determined at trial whether offence would fall under Section 9(b)
or 9(c) of Control of Narcotic Substances Act. 1997. The fact that
applicant/accused has been in jail since O06 months, yet
commencement of his trial and its conclusion is not in sight, would
also tilt the scales of the justice in the favour of bail to accused rather

jail.

7. For the above stated reasons, while relying upon cited
authorities, a case for grant of bail to the applicant/accused is made
out. The applicant shall be released on bail subject to furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (rupees one lac) and P.R bond in

the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
