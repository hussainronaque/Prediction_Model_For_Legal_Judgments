JUDGMENT

ROOH-UL-AMIN KHAN, _J:- Through instant petition
under section 561-A Cr.P.C., petitioner Qaiser, seeks
quashment of order dated 20.10.2017, rendered by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Mardan, whereby his
application under section 397 Cr.P.C. has been turned
down.

2. Facts in brief forming the background of the
instant petition are that petitioner was tried in case FIR
No.411 dated 21.11.2014, registered under section 9 (c )
Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 (to be referred
hereinafter as the Act of 1997), thus, was convicted u/s 9
(c ) of the Act of 1997 and sentenced to undergo 05 years
R.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- or in default of
payment of fine to undergo 06 months S.I. Benefit of
section 382-B Cr.P.C. was extended to him vide judgment
dated 06.02.2016.

3. Similarly, the petitioner having been tried in FIR
No.187 dated 02.06.2014, was convicted under section 9
(c ) of the Act of 1997 and sentenced to undergo 01 year
S.I. and to pay a fine of Rs.1,00,000/- or in default thereof
to undergo 01 month S.I. Benefit of section 282-B Cr.P.C.
has also been extended to him in this case.
4. After conviction of the petitioner submitted an
application seeking benefit of section 397 Cr.P.C. before
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Mardan with a
request that the sentences of the two cases be directed to
run concurrently, however, the same was dismissed vide
order dated 20.10.2017, hence, this petition.
5. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties heard
and record perused with their able assistance.
6. Before determining the entitlement of the
petitioner to the benefit of section 397 Cr.P.C., I would
like to meet the legal proposition as to whether the
petitioner can seeks the relief under section 397 Cr.P.C. by
invoking the provision of section 561-A Cr.PC.?
7. The object of provision of Section 561-A Cr.PC is
to enable the High Court to make such orders as may be
necessary to give effect to an order under Criminal
Procedure Code or to prevent the abuse of process of any
Court or otherwise to secure the ends of Justice. Thus,
powers under Section 561-A Cr.PC may well be exercised
even in matter of Section 397, but only
where petitioner/convict establishes that exercise of such
powers would cure a failure on the part of Court and
shall secure the ends of justice. The same point has been
examined by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of
“Bashir v. State” (PLD 1991 SC 1145) wherein it was
held that:

“However, during appeal or revision before

the High Court, the High Court could itself,

examine these questions, subject to limitations,

if any, provided by law and principles laid
down by this Court, and determine these

matters. Again whereby inadvertence there is

failure on the part of the High Court to

determine these questions, I cannot see any

reason why resort cannot be had to section

561-A of the Code to cure the failure, in order

to secure the ends of justice.”
8. To properly appreciate all the aspects of the
provision of the Section 397 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, I deem it appropriate to have a glance upon the said
provision first, most particularly to read it in juxtaposition
with Section 398 Cr.P.C, which, for the sake of
convenience and better understanding, are reproduced

hereunder:-

S. 397—Sentence of offender already
sentenced for another offence. When a
person undergoing a_ sentence of
imprisonment, or imprisonment for life is
sentenced to imprisonment, or
imprisonment for life, such imprisonment,
or imprisonment for life, shall_ commence

at the expiration of the imprisonment, or
imprisonment for life to which he has
been previously sentenced, unless the
court directs that the subsequent
sentence shall run concurrently with

such previous sentence.
(The underlines provides for emphasis)

S.398—Saving as to section 396 and
397. (1) Nothing in section 396 or section
397 shall be held to excuse any person
from any part of the punishment to which
he is liable upon his former or subsequent
conviction.

(2) When an award of imprisonment in
default of payment of a fine is annexed to a
substantive sentence of imprisonment or to
a sentence of [imprisonment of life], and
the person undergoing the sentences is
after its execution to undergo a further
substantive sentence, or further substantive
sentences, of imprisonment, or
{imprisonment for life] effect shall not be
given to the award of imprisonment in
default of payment of the fine until the
person has undergone the further sentence
or sentences.

Bare reading of the above quoted provisions of law will
make it manifestly clear that the legislature has left no
ambiguity about application, object and purpose of
provision of section 397 Cr.P.C. The phrase i.e ‘when a
person undergoing a sentence’ used in the section ibid, in
unambiguous term speaks only about such matter where an
accused, though undergoing a sentence, yet appearing
before a Court of law in other case/trial. From language of
the quoted provision it seems directory because it without
giving any discretion, first insists that subsequent sentence
shall commence at the expiration.of the imprisonment.
Such insists is patent from the deliberate use of the
word ‘shall’ in this provision. The objective is so for the
simple reason that punishment is awarded to the person for
the offence/ crime after due trial.One will endorse
that every sin/ offence, if proved, shall make criminal/the
wrong doer to undergo’ the punishment, so
fixed/determined, for such  offence/sin. The Criminal
Law though believes in innocence of accused but cannot
be believed to be discriminatory or prejudice to society or
State. Therefore, legislature insisted, through _ this
provision, that a criminal shall undergo punishment for
every offence, awarded through separate trial which could
only be possible if subsequent punishment runs after
expiration of earlier one, as_ stated in this
provision. However, since one of basic concept
of punishment is reformation, therefore, the Court,
trying ‘a person undergoing a sentence’, has been vested
with a discretion that such court can competently and

legally change such order of the running of the sentence.
Thus even a_ subsequently awarded sentence for
imprisonment can be ordered to run concurrently with that
sentence of imprisonment which ‘a person is already
undergoing’.

9. At this juncture, I while referring to section 382
Cr.P.C. would state that normally a conviction commences
from the time it is passed, but the provision of Section
382-B Cr.PC is a deviation to such provision. The Hon’ble
apex Court in case titled, “Shah Hussain Vs State” ( PLD
2009 (Supreme Court) 460) has made mandatory to give
benefit of Section 382-(b) Cr.PC with reference to a logical
and legal reasoning. The relevant part of the judgment read
as under:-

(1) While passing sentence, the court, in
the absence of special circumstances
disentitling the accused to have his
sentence of imprisonment reduced by the
period spent in jail during the trial,
exercise its discretion in favour of the
accused by ordering that such period shall
be counted towards his sentence of
imprisonment or that the sentence of
imprisonment shall be treated as reduced
by that period;

(2) the discretion has to be exercised with
the intention to promote the policy and
objects of the law;

(3) indeed, the court will use its good
sense in determining the circumstances in
which the discretion will not be exercised
in favour of the accused. But as the
discretion is a judicial discretion, the order
of the court must show that the pre-
sentence period has been taken into
consideration and if the court thinks that
the sentence should not be reduced by the
period spent in prison during the trial, the
court must give reasons for so thinking;

38. The practical effect of reducing the
sentence to the extent of pre-sentence
custody period, particularly, the way it is
done in Pakistan, is that the sentence takes
effect from the date of arrest of the convict
in connection with the offence. This is not
prohibited by any specific provision of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, rather this
course, prima facie, appears to be
permissible considering the provisions of
section 382-B, Cr.P.C., read with sections
233 to 240, 383, 397 and 35, Cr.P.C. This
position is also in line with the Botswana
law as noticed in Thakes's case (supra),
which empowers the Court to make the
sentence effective by a specific order from
an earlier date.

In view of the above, the Courts should not fall in error in
awarding the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C in a
mechanical manner while awarding a sentence to a person
already undergoing a sentence, for the simple reason that
by awarding benefit of Section 382-B Cr.PC the convict
becomes entitled for inclusion of period of his detention
during his trial. Had the intention of the legislature been
so, there would not have been any need to bring the
provision of Section 397 after the enactment of section
382-B of the Code.

10. The next point for determination before this Court
is to unfold the situation as to under what circumstances
the Court may order the subsequent sentence to run
concurrently with already undergoing sentence, which is
an exception to normal course. In case titled, “Ali Akber
Shah Vs State” (PLD 2004 Karachi-589), it has been held
that:

“However, after considering the gravity of
offence in the case particularly the fact that
accused had committed two offences or serious
nature within a period of five months, accused
did not deserve any leniency as he, despite
knowing that sentence of said offence which
was death or imprisonment for life, did not
care for his future’.

In case titled, “Ali Khan Kakar Vs Hammad Abbasi”

(2012 SCMR, 334), it is held that:
“The discretionary power vested in the Court
to direct the sentence to run concurrently is to
be exercised in the light of the facts and
circumstances of each case i.e. depending on
the nature and gravity of the offence.

In the case titled, “Ghulam Farid Vs State” (2013 SCMR
16), it has been ruled by the august apex Court that:

“The ratio decidendi in the precedent case-law
referred to in the preceding paragraphs is that
in terms of section 397, Cr.P.C. consecutive
sentences is a general rule while the concurrent
sentence is an exception and is to be awarded
in the exercise of discretion by the Court
depending on the facts and circumstances of
each case. In the exercise of discretion, the
Court may inter alia look into (i) the
conduct of the convict, (ii) heinousness of
crime and (iii) injury to the individual and
the society. In the instant case, the two
murders were committed at two different
places. One was committed at the house of
Muhammad Rafique deceased (F.I.R. No.154
dated 27-12-2001) and the other namely that of
Mst. Parveen Bibi was committed at
petitioner's own house when she was asleep
(F.ILR. No.155 dated 27-12-2001). These were
two different transactions though in the
defence plea, petitioner attempted to make it a
single transaction which he miserably failed to
prove. His own wife Mst. Shahzadan Bibi
appeared during trial (F.ILR. No.155 dated 27-
12-2001) to allege that the petitioner had
developed illicit liaison with her own daughter
Mst. Parveen Bibi deceased; that at his asking
she accompanied him to the nurse to cause
miscarriage of pregnancy of the said Parveen
deceased and when the said act became public,
he not only murdered Muhammad Rafique
regarding whom he suspected that he had
spread the rumour but also Parveen Bibi who
to the petitioner by then had become symbol of
his sin. Petitioner's son Ghulam Qadir also
appeared during trial in the said case as
P.W.12 and corroborated Mst. Shahzadan
Bibi. The_petitioner_not only committed
gruesome murder of two persons but his
conduct _reflects_a_ morbid, perverse_and
depraved character.
11. From the above case laws it appears that in the
exercise of discretion, the Court may, inter- alia, look into
(i) the conduct of the convict, (11) heinousness of crime and
(iii) injury to the individual and the society and that all
offences are akin or intimately connected with each other.
Such discretion can well be exercised by Court, trying
convict of other crime as an accused for other trial /
charge; anappellate Court or Revisional Court where
subsequent sentence is challenged, subject to limitation of
law. The High Court, within meaning of the Section 561-A
Cr.PC, can also exercise inherent jurisdiction but only to
prevent the failure of justice or otherwise to secure the
ends of Justice.

12. Coming to an understanding about object, import
and application of the Section 397 Cr.P.C., I, revert to the
merits of the case of the petitioner. In the instant case the
petitioner has sought concurrent running of sentences,
awarded to him through two different trial (s). The
involvement of the petitioner in similar nature offence,
committed at different times, shows his attitude of not
mending his way. Further, the petitioner has been found
guilty of offences, affecting the society at large, therefore,
I am of the considered view that he has failed to bring his
case within the exception where a deviation to normal
course is resorted.

13. Accordingly, this petition being meritless is hereby
dismissed.
