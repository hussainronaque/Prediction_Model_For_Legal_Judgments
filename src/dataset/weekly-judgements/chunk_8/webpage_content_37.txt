Cr.B.A.NO.570
of 2015
 
Date of hearing              :         22.12.2015
 
Mr.
Saeed Ahmed A. Panhwar Advocate for applicant.
Mr.
Abdul Rehman Kolachi APG.
                                       
ORDER
 
SHAHNAWAZ
TARIQ,J:-  Through captioned
post arrest bail application, applicant Mir Hassan Brohi has impugned order
dated 22.06.2015, passed by the Court of learned Ist Additional Sessions
Judge/Special Judge CNS, Khairpur, whereby his earlier bail application was
dismissed.
 
2.     Relevant
facts spelt out from instant bail application are that on 21.07.2013,
complainant impounded Truck No.C-3804 and recovered 64 bags of Poppy weighing
40 moundsand applicant was apprehended along with driver at the spot, hence
instant F.I.R.
 
3.     Learned
counsel for applicant contended that applicant is a labourer and he took lift
from main accused; that neither applicant is co-driver nor cleaner of the said
Truck and he was merely available at the spot; that applicant is behind the barsfrom
the day of his arrest but prosecution has failed to conclude the trial; that
applicanthas no previous criminal record; that applicant is sole earning member
of his family, whilehis old mother has expired during his detention and his
father is also seriously sick and bed riddle and entire family is seriously suffering
for their livelihood.
 
4.     While
controverting the above submissions, learned APG contended that applicant was
apprehended at the spot alongwith truck driver as such he could not claim his
innocence.
 
5.     I
have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the
material available on record minutely.
 
6.     Perusal
of FIR, Roznamcha Entry, Mashirnams of arrest and recovery and Challan emanate
that no specific role has been assigned to the present applicant as neither he
is owner nor co-driver or cleaner of the said truck and his mere presence at
the relevant time at the truck requires serious consideration. Indeed,
applicant was apprehended on 22.07.2013 and since then he is behind the bars
and prosecution has failed to examine a single witness during the period of 2
years and 5 months to substantiate the charge against the applicant. Admittedly,
all PWs are police officials and it was not a difficult task for the
prosecution to procure attendance of the complainant and one mashir and examine
them before the trial Court. Conversely, the unnecessary delay reflects that
complainant is not interested to proceed with the case and merely interested to
keep the applicant behind the bars. After completion of investigation, Challan
has been submitted and charge has also been framed and applicant is no more
required further for investigation, thus further detention of applicant will
not serve any useful purpose.There is no apprehension of tempering with the
prosecution evidence as all PWs are officials. Applicant never remained
involved in any criminal case nor was convicted for any offence. It is well
settled that while dealing with the question of bail, the Court should examine
the entire circumstances of the case tentatively irrespective of the sensitivity
and heinousness of the crime and bail should not be withheld as a matter of punishment.
 
7.     Considering
the above circumstances, applicant has succeeded to make out a case for grant
of bail on the ground of further enquiry as envisaged in Section 497(2),
Cr.P.C. Consequently, applicant is admitted to post arrest bail subject to his
furnishing two sureties in the sum of Rs.100,000/- each and P.R Bond in the
like amount to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.
 
8.     The
observation made above are tentative in nature and learned trial Court shall
decided the case strictly on merits.                                                               
                                                                        JUDGE
 
 
 
Akber.
