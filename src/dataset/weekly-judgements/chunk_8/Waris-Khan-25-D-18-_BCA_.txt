JUDGMENT
Date of hearing 05.4.2018

Petitioner by: Mr. Salimullah Khan Ranazai, Advocate

Respondents by: Muhammad Wahid Anjum, Advocate and
Mr. Kamran Hayat Miankhel, Addl: A.G.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.- Through the instant petition
under section 497(5) read with section 561-A Cr.P.C,
the petitioner Waris Khan has impugned the order dated
04.11.2017 of learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV,
D.I.Khan, whereby respondent No.1 was admitted to
bail in case FIR No.240 dated 25.10.2017 registered
under section 496-A PPC at police station Band Kurai,
D.I.Khan and order dated 16.01.2018 of learned
Additional Sessions Judge Paharpur (D.I.Khan),
whereby pre-arrest bail granted to the respondent in
respect of newly added section 376 PPC was confirmed

and seeks cancellation of bail granted to the respondent.

2. The facts giving rise to the instant petition, in

brief, are that Waris Khan complainant moved an
-2-

application to the local police on 22.10.2017 alleging
that on the night of 05.10.2017, his daughter Mst.
Mobeen Bibi left the house and despite search, could
not be found. The report of the complainant was entered
in daily diary and inquiry under section 157(i) Cr.P.C
was conducted. On 25.10.2017, the complainant
recorded his supplementary statement, wherein he
charged respondent No.1 for commission of offence,
hence FIR No.240 dated 25.10.2017 was registered
under section 496-A PPC at police station Band Kurai,

D.I.Khan.

3. After his arrest, the petitioner moved bail
application which was allowed by learned Additional
Sessions Judge-IV, D.I.Khan vide order dated
04.11.2017. Mst. Mobeen Bibi was recovered and she
recorded her statement under section 164 Cr.P.C on
26.10.2017 before learned Judicial Magistrate,
Paharpur, prior to the release of respondent on bail on
04.11.2017. After release of respondent No.1 on bail,
section 376 PPC was added in the FIR. Respondent
No.1 applied for pre-arrest bail which was confirmed

vide order dated 16.01.2018.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.
-3-

5. It is a matter of record that section 376 PPC
was added by the prosecution subsequently to further
aggravate the agony of respondent No.1. It is by now
settled that whenever a Court orders that an accused
person in a particular FIR be released on bail, the order
necessarily pertains to that particular FIR in its entirety.

Reliance in this respect is placed on the case of Amanat

Ali, Vs. The State (PLJ_1980 Cr.C_ Lahore 432)

wherein it has been held that:-

“It is the allegations which are
important to determine the character
of offence and not the reference to
section or an Ordinance by the
Moharrir Head Constable who
writes down the same in the FIR. It is
to be noticed that recorder of the
FIR is not even an Investigating
Officer. Te person recording the FIR
cannot be deemed to possess the
powers to put down any section or
Ordinance which he likes though
that may change the channel of trial
and lead to ouster of jurisdiction of
superior Courts.”

Reliance can also be placed on the case of Mst. Shahida

Parveen. Vs. The State and another 1995 MLD 1082).

6. It is not out of place to mention here that
normally an accused, who has already been granted bail,
is re-arrested by a police officer on the ground that new

section of law has been levelled against him, which is
-4-

against the mandate of law. Chapter XXVI, Rule 21(6)
of Police Rules, 1934 clearly provide that no person can
be re-arrested without the formal orders of a competent
Court obtained through the bail cancellation as provided
under section 497(5) Cr.P.C. For convenience, rule
21(6) of Police Rules, 1934 is reproduced as under:-

“No Police Officer has power to re-

arrest an accused person who has

been released on bail under section

497, Code of Criminal Procedure.

When re-arrest is deemed necessary,

the police shall apply to a competent

Court for the cancellation of the bail

bond and the issue of a warrant in

accordance with the provisions of

Section 497(5), Code of Criminal

Procedure.”
7. This fact cannot be denied that when the bail
application of respondent No.1 was heard by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, the entire material was
available before him including statement of the abductee
recorded under section 164 Cr.P.C and the bail granting
order was passed strictly in accordance with the
principles laid down for disposal of bail application.
Moreover, there is no allegation against respondent
No.1 that after his release on bail, he misused the

concession by repeating the offence or tampering with

the prosecution evidence. The learned counsel for the
-5-

petitioner failed to make out a case for cancellation of

bail granted to respondent No.1.

8. For the reasons mentioned above, the instant
petition being bereft of merit and substance is hereby
dismissed.

Announced.
