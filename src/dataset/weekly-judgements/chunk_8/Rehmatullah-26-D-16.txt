Appellant-petitioner Rehmat Ullah by Mr. Saleem Ullah Khan
Ranazai Advocate.
Respondent State by Mr. Kamran Hayat Miankhel AAG and Mr.
Muhammad Ismail Alizai Advocate for complainant Assisted by
Sheikh Muhammad Adeel Advocate.
MUHAMMAD AYUB_ KHAN, J.- Through this single
judgment, we propose to dispose of instant Criminal
Appeal No.26-D/2016 filed by appellant Rehmatullah
against his conviction and sentence and Murder
Reference No.3-D/2016 forwarded by learned trial Court
under section 373 Cr.P.C as both the matters are the
outcome of one and the same judgment dated 03.5.2016
of learned Sessions Judge, Tank, whereby the appellant
Rehmatullah was convicted under section 302(b) PPC and
sentenced to death as Ta’zir and to pay compensation of
Rs.5000000/- under section 544-A Cr.P.C to the legal
heirs of deceased Mst. Shamshad and also compensation

of Rs.5000000/- to the legal heirs of deceased
Misbahullah. He was further convicted under section 15
Arms Act and sentenced to three years R.I with fine of
Rs.50000/- and in default, to undergo six months SI and

benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C was extended to him.

2. The prosecution story as spelt out from the
FIR lodged by complainant Rehmatullah is that on
27.8.2014 at ‘dopehr-vela’, he alongwith his wife Mst.
Shamshad Bibi (deceased), his sons Nasratullah and
Nagqeebullah aged about 6 and 3 years respectively and
his brother Misbahullah (deceased) aged about 21/22
years, were asleep in their room; that all of sudden,
complainant got up and noticed his wife Mst. Shamshad
Bibi and brother Misbahullah in immoral actions; that
previously, the complainant was in doubt that they had
illicit relations; that accused could not bear it, he took out
his pistol lying beneath the pillow and fired two shots at
each of them. Deceased got injured and succumbed to the
injuries. That, on hearing the fire shots, mother of the
complainant namely Mst. Bulbula Bibi, his brother Abdul
Hameed and other relatives attracted to the spot and
witnessed the occurrence. That, 30 bore pistol was taken

by Abdul Hameed, brother of the complainant, hence the
report vide FIR No.93 dated 27.8.2014 registered under
section 302 PPC read with section 15 Arms Act at police

station Gomal, District Tank.

3. After completion of usual investigation,
challan against the appellant was submitted before the
learned trial Court where he was formally charged. He did
not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. In order
to establish the guilt of appellant, the prosecution
examined eight witnesses. Thereafter, statement of the
appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C, wherein
he professed innocence and false implication. However,
he neither appeared as his own witness on oath nor
produced any evidence in his defence. After hearing the
arguments, the learned trial Court convicted and
sentenced the appellant as mentioned above vide

judgment dated 03.5.2016.

4. The learned counsel for the appellant
vehemently contended that there is no eyewitness of the
occurrence and mother and brother of the appellant
attracted to the spot after hearing the fire shots; that the

pistol was produced to the police by PW Abdul Hameed
and it was not taken into possession from the appellant;
that postmortem reports of the two deceased negate the
version of prosecution; that prosecution case rests on
circumstantial evidence but the chain has been broken
many times and all such evidence has been misread and
not properly appreciated by the learned trial Court due to
which grave miscarriage of justice has occasioned by
convicting the appellant and that too, to a normal penalty

of death.

5. As against that, the learned Additional
Advocate General assisted by learned counsel
representing brothers of the two deceased contended that
the case against the appellant was proved to the hilt and
was supported by direct evidence, medical evidence,
circumstantial evidence and recovery of 30 bore pistol,
therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly convicted and

sentenced the appellant.

6. We have heard the arguments of learned
counsel for the appellant and that of learned Addl: A.G
assisted by learned counsel for brothers of the two

deceased and have gone through the record.
7. The prosecution mainly relied on the FIR
lodged by the appellant himself, recovery of 30 bore
pistol as crime weapon, report of expert, motive and
statement of Fazal Din (PW-7), brother of deceased Mst.

Shamshad Bibi.

8. First of all, we would take the FIR and its
probative value. As the record stands, the FIR was
recorded on the basis of report made by the appellant
himself. There is no cavil with the proposition that the
FIR itself is not a substantive piece of evidence unless its
contents are affirmed on oath and subjected to the test of
cross examination. Legally, it is a previous statement
which can be used for the purpose of contradicting and
corroborating its maker and unless it is not proved in
accordance with law, it is no evidence and therefore,
cannot be taken as a proof of anything stated therein. But
when it is based on a statement made by an accused
before the police which tends to incriminate him with
reference to the offence he is charged with, in that event,
it being inadmissible in evidence is not even worth the

paper it is written on, hence has to be left entirely out of
account. In the instant case, admittedly neither the maker
of FIR appeared in its support nor stood the test of cross
examination. In such circumstances, the report in the
instant case is ruled out of consideration. In this respect,

we are fortified by the case of Muhammadullah. Vs. The

State (PLD 2001 Peshawar 132).

9. Next comes the recovery of 30 bore pistol.
Admittedly, it was not recovered from personal
possession of the appellant. It is in the report of appellant
that the pistol was taken from him by his brother Abdul
Hameed. The said Abdul Hameed has been abandoned by
the prosecution and thus the best available evidence to
support such recovery has been withheld. As stated
earlier, the FIR has been left out of consideration,
therefore, the same is of no avail to the prosecution.
Though the report of F.S.L (Ex.PC) reveals that the four
empties were fired from 30 bore pistol No.XN 836-1957
but since the recovery of pistol to be weapon of offence
has been disbelieved, therefore, the report of F.S.L is of

no help to the prosecution.
10. The cause of murder in the FIR has been
mentioned by the appellant that all of sudden, he got up
and noticed his wife Mst. Shamshad Bibi and brother
Misbahullah busy in nefarious actions; that such actions
annoyed him, he took out his pistol lying beneath the
pillow and fired two shots each at them, who got injured
and succumbed to the injuries. The report of F.S.L Ex:PK
reveals that vaginal swabs of Mst. Shamshad Bibi were
sent for chemical analysis which were found negative for
semen. As Fazal Din (PW-7) brother of deceased Mst.
Shamshad Bibi is not an eyewitness of the occurrence,
therefore, it is of no benefit to the prosecution. It is by
now a settled principle of law that for giving benefit of
doubt to an accused, it is not necessary that there should
be many circumstances creating doubts. If a simple
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind
about the guilt of accused, then he will be entitled to such
benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as a
matter of rights. The above narrated facts and
circumstances created reasonable doubts in the

prosecution story but the learned trial Court has not taken
into consideration these benefits and erred in convicting

the appellant.

11. For the reasons mentioned above, we accept
Criminal Appeal No.26-D/2016, set aside the impugned
judgment of conviction and sentence dated 03.5.2016 and
consequently acquit the appellant Rehmatullah of the
charges levelled against him in this case. He shall be set

free forthwith from Jail if not required in any other case.

12. Murder Reference No.3-D/2016 is answered in
negative.
13. Above are the detailed reasons for our short

order of even date.
Announced.
