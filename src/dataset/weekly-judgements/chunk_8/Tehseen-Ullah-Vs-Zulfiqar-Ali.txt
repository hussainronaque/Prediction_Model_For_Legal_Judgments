2. Through the instant appeal, the appellant has
questioned his conviction and sentences while
petitioner/complainant has filed connected Cr.R.
No.109-P/2015, titled, “Zulfiqar Ali Vs Tehseen Ullah” for
enhancement of his sentence. Since, both the matters are
the outcome of one and the same judgment of the learned
Trial Court, therefore, this single judgment shall govern
both.

3. The prosecution case as unfolded in First
Information Report is that on 15.09.2012 at 1330 hours,
complainant Zulfiqar Ali (PW.10) alongwith his brother
Muhammad Ali, was present on a thoroughfare in front of
the house of Kifayat Ullah, situated in village Dhab Banda,
when in the meantime, Tehseen Ullah (appellant-convict
herein) accompanied by absconding co-accused Maqsood
ur Rehman, Jamil ur Rehman and Najeeb ur Rehman, duly
armed with firearms came there and opened fire at them, as
a result, he got hit and sustained injuries; that due to
indiscriminate firing of the accused a passerby, namely,
Zia ur Rehman, also sustained injuries. In addition to him,

the incident is stated to have been witnessed by

Muhammad Ali (not produced). Motive behind the
incident is stated to be a dispute over landed property.
4. Report of the complainant was recorded in
the shape of murasila Exh.PA/1 by Muhammad Zaman
Khan Inspector (PW.1) in DHQ hospital Charsadda. He
prepared injury sheet of injured Zulfigar Ali Exh.PW.1/1
and that of injured Zia ur Rehman Exh.PW.1/2 and
referred them for medical examination. He sent the
murasila to Police Station on the basis of which FIR
No.1191 dated 15.09.2012 under section 324/34 PPC, was
registered in Police Station Charsadda against the accused.
5. Dr. Manzoor Ullah (PW.4), examined
injured Zulfiqar and found the following injuries on his
person:-
1. Firearm entry wound size about 2 x 2 cm on right

side wrist on posterior side.
2. Firearm entry wound % x % cm on left side

abdomen.

After administering first aid, he referred the injured
to LRH, Peshawar for further management.
Kind of weapon: Firearm

He also examined injured Zia ur Rehman and

found a firearm entry wound size about % x % cm on left

side buttock.

6. Mukhtiar Khan ASI (PW.7) proceeded to the
spot and prepared site plan Exh.PB at the instance of PW
Muhammad Ali. During spot inspection he took into
possession three empties of 7.62 bore Exh.P.1 vide
recovery memo Exh.PW.7/1. Vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.7/2 and Exh.PW.7/3 he took into possession
bloodstained garments of the two injured, secured blood
from the place of injured Zulfiqar vide recovery memo
Exh.PW.7/4, initiated proceedings under sections 204 and
87 Cr.P.C. against the accused, sent the bloodstained
articles to the FSL, reports whereof are Exh.PZ and
Exh.PZ/1, recorded statements of the PWs and after
completion of investigation handed over case file to the
SHO who submitted challan in terms of S.512 Cr.P.C.
against the accused.

7. Later on, accused/appellant was arrested.
Supplementary challan was submitted against him before
the learned Trial Court, where he was formally charge
sheeted to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
To prove its case prosecution examined eleven witnesses.
After closure of the prosecution evidence, statement of the
accused/appellant was recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C.
wherein he denied the prosecution allegation and professed

his innocence. He, however, neither wished to be

examined on oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C. nor opted
to produce evidence in defence. On conclusion of trial, the
learned Trial Court, after hearing both the sides, convicted
and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above.

8. Learned counsel for the appellant argued that
appellant is innocent and has been implicated falsely; that
injured Zia ur Rehman has never charged the appellant
from the very first day nor did he apepar in the witness
box; that PW Muhammad Ali has been abandoned for no
good reasons while the solitary testimony of injured
complainant being in contrast with medical evidence and
other circumstances of the incident create serious doubts
about his credibility, reliability and truthfulness and mere
stamp of injuries on his person would not be a certificate
of his truthfulness as the intrinsic worth of statement of a
witness is the test of his veracity and not injuries; that by
throwing net wide four real brothers have been charged
whereas one and the same dimensions of entrance wounds
on the persons of the two injured and FSL report qua the
recovered empties being fired from one and the same
weapon, suggest the incident to be the job of single person;
that escape of Muhammad Ali or his left off by the
accused having common motive does not appeal to a

prudent mind; that four persons have been charged for

indiscriminate firing therefore, much damage should have
been caused to the complainant and large number of the
empties should have been recovered from the spot, but
situation is quite contrary as only three empties have been
recovered and two injuries have been observed on the
person of the injured complainant; that since general role
of firing has been given to four accused, therefore,
corroboration qua participation of each accused in the
incident was to be proved, but the prosecution miserably
failed to do so as neither the appellant has confessed his
guilt before the competent Court of law, nor the crime
weapon or anything incriminating to prove his
participation in the incident has been recovered either from
his direct or indirect possession, therefore, the learned
Trial Court while squarely oversighting the aforesaid facts
and circumstance, reached to a wrong conclusion by
holding the appellant guilty of the offence; that the
impugned judgment being against the law, facts and
evidence on record is liable to be reversed.

9. Conversely, learned AAG assisted by learned
counsel for the complainant contended that appellant is
directly charged for the incident with specific role of firing
alongwith absconding co-accused in a promptly lodged

report; that being a broad daylight incident question of

mistaken identity does not arise; that straight forward
testimony of injured complainant corroborated by medical
evidence as well as recovery of blood and empties from the
spot coupled with unexplained noticeable abscondence of
the appellant is sufficient to bring home the guilt of the
appellant; they while supporting the impugned judgment
sought dismissal of the appeal and requested for
enhancement of sentence of the appellant as according to
them there is no mitigating circumstance to warrant lesser
sentence.

10. I have heard the arguments and have gone
through the record.

11. Injured-complainant Zulfiqar Ali in support of
his version while appearing as PW.10, reiterated the same
story as set forth in his initial report. According to his
stance the incident took place at 13.30 hours i.e. in broad
day light. In the site plan he has been shown at point No.1,
passerby injured Zia ur Rehman at point No.2 and PW
Muhammad Ali (abandoned) at point No.3. The inter-se
distance of injured complainant and Muhammad Ali has
been shown as four paces while between the complainant
and the accused as 8 to 10 paces. A land dispute has been
alleged as motive between the parties. As per medico legal

report injured Zulfiqar has sustained only two firearm

entry wounds, one on right side wrist and other on left side
abdomen while Muhammad Ali has not sustained any
injury. The role of indiscriminate firing has been attributed
to four accused. Though complainant in his report has not
specifically disclosed the description of weapon used in the
commission of offence, but since 03 empties of 7.62 bore
have been shown recovered from the spot, therefore, it can
be presumed that Kalashnikov has been used in the
incident, which is a common weapon particularly in the
Pathan society and is recognized even by _ kids.
Complainant and abandon PW Muhammad Gul are real
brothers inter-se and having common motive were on
equal footings for the accused, therefore, sparing of
Muhammad Gul and targeting of his brother complainant
by the accused is beyond my comprehension. The non-
mentioning of weapon of offence specifically in his initial
report by injured-complainant despite being a broad
daylight incident keeping in view the distance of 8 to 10
paces of the accused from him, is sufficient proof that he
did not notice the culprit fired upon him while PW
Muhammad Gul keeping in view the above circumstances
was not at all present on the spot. Had he been there, he
would have also been targeted. Since, indiscriminate firing

by four accused with automatic weapons which eject

number of shots in seconds, has been alleged, therefore,
much damage should have been caused to the complainant
or at least large number of empties should have been
recovered from the spot, but only three empties have been
recovered and two injuries on the person of complainant
has been observed by the medical officer and this aspect of
the case also creates doubt about the mode and manner of
the incident that the same has not taken place as alleged by
the complainant which fact further got support from one
and the same dimensions of entrance wounds on the person
of injured complainant and passerby Zia ur Rehman as
well as the FSL report qua the empties recovered from the
spot to have been fired from one and the same weapon and
suggests the incident to be the doing of single person,
which create doubts about the credibility and truthfulness
of injured complainant. The presence of injuries on his
person can only be indication of his presence at the spot
but would not be affirmative proof of his credibility and
truth because the intrinsic worth of testimony of a witness
is the test of his veracity. The charge has been exaggerated
by complainant and he has not come forward with truthful
account of the incident. Not an iota of evidence is available
in the shape of direct or circumstantial evidence to prove

that single person to be the appellant.

10

12. For what has been discussed above, the
prosecution evidence is pregnant with doubts benefit of
which is to be extended to the accused not as a matter of
grace or concession but as a matter of right in light of
golden principle of doubt according to which one
substantial doubt would be enough for acquittal of the
accused. The rule of benefit of doubt is essentially a rule
of prudence, which cannot be ignored while dispensing
Justice in accordance with law. Conviction must be based
on unimpeachable evidence and certainty of guilt and any
doubt arising in the prosecution case, must be resolved in
favour of the accused. The said rule is based on the
maxim “ it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted
rather than one innocent person be convicted” which
occupied a pivotal place in the Islamic Law and is
enforced strictly in view of the saying of the Holy Prophet
(PBUH) that the “mistake of Qazi (Judge) in releasing a
criminal is better than his mistake in punishing an
innocent”. Wisdom in this regard can also be derived from
the judgments of the apex court in case titled,
”’Muhammad Khan and another Vs the State” (1999
SCMR 1220) and case titled, “Muhammad Ikram Vs

the State” (2009 SCMR 230).

11

13. The learned Trial Court failed to appreciate
the available evidence in its true perspective in light of
golden principle of appreciation of evidence and thus
reached to erroneous conclusion by holding the appellant
guilty of the offence. Resultantly, this appeal is allowed,
the conviction and sentences of the appellant recorded by
the learned Trial Court are hereby set aside and the
appellant is acquitted of the charge leveled against him.
He be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other
case. On acquittal of the appellant connected Criminal
Revision No.109-P/2015, has become infructuous which
stands dismissed as such.
14. These are reasons of my short order of even
date which read as under:-

appeal, set aside the conviction and sentences
