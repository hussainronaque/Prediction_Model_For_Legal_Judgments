************************
Abdul Maalik Gaddi,J  Applicant/Accused
seeks post-arrest bail in Crime No. 182/2013 under Section 23-A(1), Sindh Arms
Act, 2013 of Police Station Pakistan Bazar, Karachi
2.         Facts of the prosecution case in
brief are that on the day of incident complainant SIP Muhammad Anwer Mirani of
P.S. Pak. Bazar was busy in patrolling and found two suspected persons. He
apprehended them and they disclosed their names Muhammad Shahid s/o Tabark
Hussain and Hanif Ali @ Shamim s/o Haider Ali. On their personal search one
unlicensed pistol 30 bore without number loaded with magazine, with two live
bullets was recovered from accused Muhammad Shahid and one unlicensed pistol 30
bore without number loaded with magazine with two live bullets from accused
Hanif @ Shamim. Case property was sealed at spot and accused brought to Police
Station. Thereafter he lodged the instant FIR.
3.         After usual investigation, challan
was submitted against accused under the above referred sections.
4.         Bail application was moved on
behalf of the applicant/accused the same was rejected by the learned 4th
Additional Sessions Judge Karachi West vide his order dated 11.10.2013.
5.         Heard the learned counsel for the
applicant/accused and learned APG  as well as perused the record.
6.         Counsel for the applicant/accused
contends that the scene of the offence was located at busy spot yet none from
the public was joined to attest the recovery. The T.T. Pistol allegedly
recovered from the applicant was neither sealed at the spot nor certified by
ballistic expert to be in working order. The applicant has got enmity with the
complainant party and the case is registered against him malafidely. Challan
against the applicant has already been submitted and the case of the applicant
is based upon the evidence of two police officials and their evidence require
thoroughly scrutiny at the time of trial. As such he has prayed for bail.
7.         Learned APG has opposed the bail
plea stating that the offence carries punishment upto 14 years thus the case of
the applicant attracts embargo contained in Section 497 Cr.P.C. He has further
submitted that there is no malafide on the part of the complainant and the
present applicant was arrested on the spot.
8.         I have given my anxious thought to
the contentions raised at the bar and have gone through the police papers.
9.         After hearing the parties
advocates, I am inclined to grant bail to the applicant/accused for the reasons
that all the prosecution witnesses are police officials, therefore, their
evidence is required thoroughly scrutiny at the time of trial. Case has been
challaned. Applicant is no more required for investigation. There is no
apprehension of tampering with the prosecution evidence. The T.T. Pistol
allegedly recovered from the possession of the applicant/accused was not sealed
at the spot, therefore, it is not curtained whether the alleged pistol
allegedly recovered from the applicant sent to ballistic expert was same or
otherwise. Admittedly, the applicant was arrested from the populated area but
no independent witness was cited to witness the recovery. No effort has been
made to associate any private person to act as mashir of recovery and arrest of
the applicant/accused. On this count, the case in hand appears to further
inquiry. 
 
In view of above, what I
have observed above, the applicant has made out a case of further inquiry. I,
therefore, allow this bail application. Resultantly, the applicant is granted
bail after his furnishing surety in the sum of Rs.25,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five
Thousand) and P.R. Bond in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned
trial Court.
