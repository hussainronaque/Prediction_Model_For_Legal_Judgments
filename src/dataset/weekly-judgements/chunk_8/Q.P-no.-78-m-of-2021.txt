accused/respondents No. | to 3 at P.S Bahrain, Swat
wherein he charged accused-respondent Muhammad
Imran initially u/s 496-A for enticing away his wife
Mst. Musarrat Bibi for the purpose of illegal
matriage at the instigation of his father Baboo Khan

and brother Muhammad Saleem.

3. During the course of investigation, the
alleged abductee was recovered from the house of
accused-respondents and her statement was recorded
u/s 164, Cr.P.C on 09.04.2020. According to her
narrations in the said statement, she had illicit
relations with accused-respondent Muhammad
Imran but after her marriage she was living her
matrimonial life happily. The said accused used to
go to the house of his maternal uncle by using the
thoroughfare in front of her house, therefore, her in-
laws used to tease her on the pretext of her illicit
relations with accused Muhammad Imran who came
to the door of her house on the day of occurrence
and enticed her away to a deserted house in jungle
where he kept her for four months and committed
sexual intercourse with her. Lastly they were
arrested by police when they had come to the house
of accused Baboo Khan, father of the remaining

accused.

4. After completion of investigation,
challan was put in Court against all the accused.
Formal charge was framed against them on
20.08.2020 wherein they were initially indicted u/s
496-A/109 PPC. After recording statements of 16
witnesses, the alleged abductee was examined as,
PW-17 on 26.08.2021 wherein she leveled the
allegations against accused Imran and three others
for abducting her from her house on gun point. She
further alleged that the accused forcibly took her to a
deserted house in jungle and raped her for four

months.

In light of the above statement recorded
by alleged abductee, prosecution submitted an
application before the trial Court for alteration of
formal charge with the prayer for addition of
sections 376, 365-B/ 34 PPC. The learned trial Court
accepted the said application vide order dated
27.08.2021. Since the trial Court lacked the
jurisdiction in respect of trial of the accused under
the proposed penal sections, therefore, vide order
dated 28.08.2021 the case was ordered to be sent to
the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge,

Bahrain for further proceedings.

5. Being aggrieved, accused-respondents
challenged the order of learned trial Court through a
revision petition which was accepted by learned
revisional Court vide judgment dated 12.10.2021,
resultantly order dated 27.08.2021 of the learned
trial Court was set aside and the case was sent to
trial Court for disposal in accordance with law,

hence, this petition.

6. I have heard the arguments and perused
the record with able assistance of learned counsel for
the parties including the learned Assistant A.G for

State.

Zz There is no denial of the fact that trial
Court is vested with the powers u/s 227 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure to alter or add to the formal
charge at any time before pronouncement of
judgment, however, these powers should not be
arbitrarily exercised in a manner prejudicial to any
of the parties. In the present case, the trial is at the
verge of conclusion and almost all the PWs,
including the alleged abductee, have already been

examined.

8. The contents of FIR suggest that

complainant had reported the matter to police

regarding willful departure of the alleged abductee
from her house. After recovery of the lady, she
recorded her statement u/s 164, Cr.P.C before the
Judicial Magistrate in line of FIR but during her
examination before the trial Court as PW-17 on
26.08.2021, she altogether changed her initial
version after 16 % months and charged the accused
for her abduction on gun point with further
allegation of subjecting her to rape. Though two
accused namely Baboo Khan and Muhammad
Saleem are on bail but accused Muhammad Imran is
behind the bars since the date of his arrest.
Alteration of the charge at this stage, as suggested
by prosecution, would obviously inject a new life
into the trial proceedings already initiated almost
one and half a year ago and the last sufferer thereof
would be the accused who is facing the agonies of
trial from jail. Learned counsel for the respondents/
accused mainly stressed on the improved version of
prosecution. At this stage, this Court will not delve
deep into merits of the case lest it may prejudice the
case of either side, however, I feel no hesitation in
observing that presumption of truth is attached to the
statement recorded by alleged abductee u/s 164,

Cr.P.C and effect of her improved version on

prosecution case will be looked into by trial Court at
the time of final decision. For the time being,
alteration of the charge has prejudiced the accused,
therefore, the findings of learned trial Court cannot
be verified rather I find myself in agreement with the

observations of learned revisional Court.

9 It appears that the issue has been raised
for further perpetuation of the trial proceedings in
the garb of amending formal charge, therefore, the
order of trial Court, while accepting the application
of prosecution, was in violation of settled principles
of criminal justice. This Court has already observed
that although alteration of the charge can be sought
at any time before pronouncement of judgment and
the trial Court can exercise its powers in this regard
u/s 227, Cr.P.C but the jurisdiction is required to be
exercised if so warranted by the circumstances of the
case in the interests of justice and not to prolong the
proceedings. Reliance in this regard is placed on
‘Muhammad Afzal Vs. The State’ (1990 SCMR
267). In the said case application for alteration of
formal charge was filed at the stage of arguments
which was concurrently dismissed by trial Court and

High Court. The august Supreme Court, while

‘Tajamul/Ps*

hearing petition against the orders of the lower fora,

observed that:

On the other hand, we cannot avoid the
impression that the prayer now being made
by the petitioners for amendment of the
charge is intended to prolong the proceedings.
In the circumstances we are not prepared to
intervene in the matter.
9 In light of the above discussion, the
impugned judgment of the learned revisional Court,
being in accordance with law, does not call for any
interference. Resultantly, this petition, having no
merits, is accordingly dismissed. Cr.M No. 324-M/

2021 is also dismissed for having become

infructuous.
