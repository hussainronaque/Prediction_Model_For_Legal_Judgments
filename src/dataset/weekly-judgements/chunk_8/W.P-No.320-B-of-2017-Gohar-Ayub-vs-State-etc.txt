JUDGEMENT/ORDER.
Date of hearing 06.3.2019
Appellant-Petitioner: | Haji Hamayun Khan

Wazir, Adevocate.

Respondent(s): By Mr. Inam Ullah Khan
Mandra Khel, Advocate,

State by Mr. Shahid Hameed
Addl: AG.

MUHAMMAD NASIR MAHFOOZ, J.- Petitioner
seeks quashment of FIR No.724 dated 12.12.2013
registered under sections 468/419/420/471/409/406
PPC on the application of respondent No.2 filed
under section 22-A Cr.P.C before the learned Justice

of Peace, vide impugned order dated 11.12.2013.

2. As per averments in the instant petition
respondent No.2 had already filed an application
dated 23.10.2012 to the District Police Officer,
Lakki Marwat for registration of FIR, which was
referred to Director Anti-Corruption, Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa and the matter was sent for inquiry to
-2-

the Anti-Corruption Establishment, therefore, the
application under section 22-A Cr.P.C was not

maintainable.

3. We have heard learned counsel for the
parties, learned AAG for the State and perused the

record with their assistance.

4. Before discussing the factual and legal
aspects of this case, it requires to be mentioned that
the present petitioner had earlier filed writ petition
No.413-B/2013, challenging the instant order dated
11.12.2013, passed by learned Justice of Peace,
which was filed on 16.12.2013 but the same was
dismissed on 25.02.2015 on the ground that the
petitioner was absconder in another FIR No.424
dated 28.5.2014 registered under _ sections
302/324/34 PPC. The instant FIR was lodged on
12.12.2013 and the said writ petition was filed later
on but perhaps the fact of lodging of FIR was

concealed from this Court.

5. Record also reveals that the present
petitioner has lodged FIR No.54 against respondent
No.2 under section 489-F PPC that is still pending

investigation. No record of the Anti-Corruption
-3-

office has been annexed with the present petition, in
order to be acquainted with the present stage of the
proceedings therein. On facts as alleged, the present
petitioner is a Government servant and _ has
purportedly used the National Identity Card of
respondent No.2 and got him appointed on the post
in addition to receiving salary on his behalf but
without informing him which led to the lodging of
the instant FIR. The correctness or incorrectness of
the allegations as contained in the FIR are yet to be
put to trial before the Anti-Corruption Establishment
as well as before the learned trial Court in pursuance
to the instant FIR, so we need not go into the depth

of details of the allegations contained therein.

6. Learned counsel for the petitioner led
much stress on the legal ground, that once a
Government servant is involved in the case under
the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 then the
local police has got no jurisdiction to register a fresh
FIR on the same allegations and relied on PLD 2008
Peshawar 162. Learned counsel for the respondent
No.2 and learned A.A.G for the State vehemently
resisted the arguments of learned counsel for the

petitioner and relied on judgment reported as 1981
-4-

SCMR 1101, 2005 YLR 1329, PLD 1999 Lahore

109 and 2005 MLD 1647.

7. Before analyzing the question of
involvement in the said judgment, it would be
worthwhile to refer sub-section 4 of section 5 of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, which provides

as follows:-

“5 (4) The provisions of this section
shall be in addition to, and not in
derogation of, any other law for the
time being in force, and nothing
contained herein shall exempt any
public servant from any proceeding

which might, apart from _ this

’

section, be instituted against him.’

&. Similar contentions were considered by
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in judgment
reported 1981 SCMR 1101 titled Abdul Latif Vs.
M. Paracha and others” and any overriding effect
of the Act of 1947 was not held to prevail and
another FIR lodged against the appellant therein
under the Anti-Smuggling (Rice and paddy) Law
was held valid as section 8 of the West Pakistan
Anti-Corruption Establishment Ordinance, 1961 are

also pari materia to sub-section 4 mentioned above.
-5-

9. To embark on factual controversy
involved in the instant case would tantamount to
exceeding jurisdiction as conferred by Article 199 of
the Constitution of Pakistan, that was also
considered in the judgment reported as (2006
SCMR 276) titled “Col. Shah Sadiq Vs.
Muhammad Ashiq and others” and the relevant

portion is reproduced below:-

“ It is also a settled proposition of law
that if prima facie an offence has been
committed, ordinary course of trial
before the Court should not be allowed
to be deflected by resorting to
constitutional jurisdiction of High
Court. By accepting the constitutional
petition the High Court erred in law to
short circuit the normal procedure of
law as provided under Cr.P.C. and
police rules while exercising equitable
jurisdiction which is not in consonance
with the law laid down by this Court in
A. Habib Ahmad vy. M.K.G. Scott
Christian PLD 1992 SC 353. The
learned High Court had quashed the
FIR. in such a manner as if the
respondent had filed an appeal before
the High Court against order passed
by trial Court. The learned High Court

had no jurisdiction to quash the
-6-

impugned F.I.R. by appreciation of the

documents produced by the parties

without providing chance to cross-

examine or confronting the documents

in question.”
10. The case of petitioner would also be
looked into from this angle vis-a-vis section 561-A
Cr.P.C, whereby High Court is also vested with the
power to pass an order to secure the ends of justice,
suppress the mischief, and if non-interference with
the impugned order would perpetuate injustice.
Though the ultimate object is to prevent abuse of
process of law and similarly, in constitutional
petition under Article 199, the order for quashment
of FIR could be passed, if it meets the said
requirements. No detailed examination of facts
could be made in the instant constitutional petition
as it would have the trappings of a final order as
held by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Shah Sadiq’s
case. Sub-section 4 explicitly lays down that no
public servant shall be exempted from any
proceedings which might be instituted against him,

apart from section 5 of the Act of 1947.

11. In the presence of sub-section 4 of

section 5 of the Act of 1947 and section 8 of the
-7-

Ordinance of 1961, the instant FIR lodged against
the petitioner by the local police does not constitute
a case of overlapping with the case of the Anti-
Corruption Establishment and the same could
proceed together in accordance with law. Hence, the

instant petition is dismissed with no order as to cost.
