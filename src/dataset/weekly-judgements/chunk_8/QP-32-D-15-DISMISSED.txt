JUDGMENT SHEET
PESHAWAR HIGH COURT D.I.KHAN BENCH

JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT
Cr.MQ No. 32-D of 2015
Date of hearing 03/07/2015

Appellant / petitioner (Sher Afzal) by Liaqat Ali Amjad

advocate

Respondent (State) by Mr. Adnan Ali Assistant AAG

MUHAMMAD _GHAZANFER KHAN __J.-The
petitioner, namely, SherAfzal Khan, through the instant
petition under section 561-A Cr.PC has assailed the order
dated 18/5/2015 of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge-I'V  DJ..Khan, whereby his application
forsuperdariof motorcar bearing registration No.ATE-364
in black colour, Model-2010 involved in case FIR
No.194 dated 11/5/2015 under section 15 of the Arms
Act registered in police station SaddarD.I.Khan was
dismissed.

2. According to the FIR, huge quantity of arms
and ammunitions have been recovered from the motorcar
in question driven by the petitioner at the relevant time

for which he was having no valid license or permit.
3. I have carefully gone through record of the
case and anxiously considered the arguments addressed

at the bar by learned counsels for the parties.

4. Perusal of record transpires that the
petitioner has failed to produce any document before the
Courts below and even today before this Court to show
that he is lawful owner of the vehicle in question.
Besides, some of the arms and ammunitions have been
recovered from secret cavities of the said motorcar and in
such circumstances, the plea of the petitioner that he was
having no knowledge of the samedoes not appeal to a

prudent mind.

5. By now there is no denial of the fact that
once the FIR is registered, the Superior Courts having
constitutional, supervisory and inherent jurisdiction have
consistently refrained from direct interference with the
investigation conducted by the local police in a criminal
case, as the courts could not exercise the control over the
investigation which may be prejudicial to the fairness of

proceedings, apart from being without jurisdiction.

6. While going through the contents of the FIR

and record of the case, one could find no infirmity legal
or otherwise, or any jurisdictional defect which could
justify this Court to interfere in the matter under section
561-A Cr.PC, unless and until very exceptional
circumstances exist and which, as is evident from the

record, is not the case here.

In a case law reported as Doctor Ghulam
Mustafa..Vs..The State (2008 SCMR 76), it has been
held that the High Court has no jurisdiction, whatsoever,
to take the role of investigation agency and to quash the
FIR while exercising the inherent power under section
561-A Cr.PC, unless and until very exceptional

circumstances exists.

5. So was held in the case of Ghulam

Muhammad..Vs..Muhammad Khan reported in PLD
1967 Supreme Court 317) that remedy of quashment

of proceedings is not available when alternate remedy is

available in the shape of sections 249-A or 265-K Cr.PC.

6. In view of the above, this petition being

bereft of any merit is dismissed.
