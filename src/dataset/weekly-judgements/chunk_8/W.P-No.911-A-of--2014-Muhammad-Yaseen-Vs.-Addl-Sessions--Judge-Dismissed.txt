Appellant(s)/Petitioner (s)

Respondent (s)

QALANDAR ALI KHAN, J:- Muhammad
Yaseen kalwar, petitioner, has filed the instant
writ petition under Article 199 of the
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
1973, read with Section 561-A_ Cr.PC,
impugning thereby order dated 16.12.2014 of
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II,
Haripur, whereby complaint of respondent No.2,
Alamzeb, against him under Illegal
Dispossession Act relating to Hydal Power
Project, Khanpur Dam, Haripur, was accepted
for regular hearing and process was issued

against the petitioner.
2. In his application/complaint to the
Sessions Judge, Haripur, under the Illegal
Dispossession Act, respondent No.2 claimed
that he entered into a lease agreement with
SHYDO, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
for construction of Hydal Power Project Khanpur
dam Left Bank Canal (RD 3700) on 11™
January 2005, and obtained possession of the
site under the lease agreement, which was still
with him for his Company M/S Bismillah Co,
and that he secured loan of Rs.13600000/- for
construction of civil structure of the project and
had also constructed ice factory etc by
mortgaging his shops situated in satellite town,
Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Council of Renewable
Energy Technology, Government of Pakistan,
but for the purpose he had to associate with
him the registered Company of Mst Qadeera
Yaseen and Obaid Ullah, which, otherwise, had
no concern, whatsoever, with the project. The
respondent’ alleged that the petitioner
committed fraud in the accounts of the
Company, therefore, he disassociated himself

from the Company. He also alleged that when
he visited the project at Khanpur' on
23.06.2014, he found police guards of Sind
House deployed there by the petitioner, who
prevented him from entering the project. The
respondent further alleged that while taking
advantage of his position as a police officer, the
petitioner got him and staff of the project bound
down under Sections 107 and 151 Cr.PC
through local police of Police Station Khanpur.

3. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge-II Haripur, after hearing arguments on
maintainability of the complaint under the
Illegal Dispossession Act, held that SHYDO had
confirmed lease agreement with the
respondent/complainant and that Bismillah
Company and Bismillah Power Company were
two different entities and further that the
respondent/petitioner herein could not produce
any lease agreement in respect of the project in
question in favour of Bismillah Power Company,
therefore, allegations of both the parties and
subsequent dispossession of the
complainant/respondent could only be proved

and/or disproved through production of pro
and contra evidence. The complaint was,
accordingly, held maintainable and_ after
providing copies to the respondent/petitioner
herein under Section 265-C Cr.PC, the
complaint was posted for framing of charge on
02.01.2015, vide order dated 16.12.2014,
which is impugned herein.

4. Arguments of the learned counsel for
the parties heard, and record perused.

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner
argued that though the original lease
agreement dated 11.01.2005 was entered into
between respondent No.2 and SHYDO but
respondent No.2 had acted on behalf of M/S
Bismillah Company, which was _lateron
converted into Bismillah Power (Pvt) Limited on
the application of respondent No.2, who
subsequently resigned from Bismillah Power
(Pvt) Limited and was, thus, no more Director
in the Company or having anything to do with
the possession or operation of the project. The
learned counsel referred to several documents
showing payment of lease amount by the major

share holder in the company i.e. 60 shares,
namely, Qadeeran Yaseen Kalwar, wife of the
petitioner. The learned counsel maintained that
respondent No.2 was neither in possession nor,
as such, dispossessed illegally, therefore, the
complaint/application under Section % of Illegal
Dispossession Act, 2005, was not maintainable.
6. The learned counsel for the
respondent, on the other hand, contended that
the lease agreement would clearly show the
respondent as a leasee of the leased area, who
was authorized under the lease agreement to
enter upon the lease area from the day of
commencement of the lease. The learned
counsel further contended that the respondent
associated himself with Bismillah Powers (Pvt)
Limited only for the limited purpose of securing
loan, while the lease agreement remained intact
with M/S Bismillah Company, which was never
dissolved or converted into Bismillah Power
(Pvt) Limited. The learned counsel urged that
resignation of the respondent from Bismillah
Power (Pvt) Limited had, therefore, no effect,
whatsoever, on the lease or possession of the

respondent, and that illegal dispossession of the
respondent from the leased area by the
petitioner, having no concern, at all, with either
of the companies, accrued a cause of action in
favour of the respondent to approach the Court
of competent jurisdiction under the relevant
provision of law for appropriate legal action
against the petitioner.

7. The respective claims and counter
claims of the parties have been enumerated
above with the only aim to demonstrate that
there are factual controversies between the
parties giving rise to several issues relating to
the lease agreement and rights of the parties
there-under, besides the main controversy of
possession or otherwise of the respondent and
his dispossession therefrom; which, indeed,
could not be resolved either through writ
petition; or without recording pro and contra
evidence.

8. Apart from the impugned order being
interim in nature, the framing of charge was by
no means proof of guilt of the petitioner,
rather the same provided him the

opportunity to put forth his case, besides
proving the falsehood of the complaint, and
thus avail the chance of proceeding against
the complainant under the relevant provision of
law. (2009 SCMR 1066, 2012 SCMR 229,
PLD 2010 S.C 725, 2010 SCMR 1254, 2012
MLD 1652, PLD 2011 Karachi 624, PLD
2013 Islamabad 121 and PLD 2011
Peshawar 86).

9. The above referred inbuilt remedies,
available to the petitioner under the law, would
make the writ petition not maintainable.
Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed.
