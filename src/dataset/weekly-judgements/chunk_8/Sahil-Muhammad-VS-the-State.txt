JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, J.-

Petitioner Sahil Muhammad, who has been

declined bail on merits upto this Court in case

FIR No.48/2013, dated 12.11.2013, registered

under sections 409/477-A/109/34 PPC and

Sections 3 & 4 AML Act as well as S.5 (2)

Prevention of Corruption Act, in Police Station

FIA/CBC, Peshawar, through this further

petition, seeks concession of bail on fresh

ground/ statutory ground under third Proviso to

8.497 Cr.P.C. The learned Trial Court has

declined bail to him on the ground of non-

*M Siraj Afridi PS. D

provision of bail on statutory ground under S.5

(6) of Offences in Respect of Banks Ordinance,

1984, and that the Ordinance, 1984 being a

Special law, the petitioner cannot claim bail on

under third Proviso to S.497 Cr.P.C.

2. Learned counsel for the petitioner

argued that co-accused, namely, Imtiaz Ali has

already been granted bail by this Court on

statutory ground vide order dated 10.06.2015,

therefore on the doctrine of consistency the

petitioner is also entitled to same treatment as

under Article 25 of the Constitution all citizens

are equal before the law and are entitled to equal

protection of law; that petitioner is behind the

bars since 07.11.2013 (one years and 10

months), and despite strict directions of this

court no progress has been made in his trial so

much so that charge has not been framed against

the petitioner and due to the conduct of the

prosecution, he is languishing in jail; that

statutory period of one year has already been

elapsed while the delay in conclusion of trial has

not been caused on the act or omission of the

petitioner or anybody acting on his behalf; that

the learned Trial Court while dismissing bail

petition of the petitioner has erred in law as the

relief sought under third proviso to S.497

Cr.P.C. is a statutory right, mandatory in nature

and is not left to the discretion of the Court but

is controlled by the Statute; that the findings of

the learned Trial Court are not based on legal

premises as under section 5 (6) of the Ordinance

1984, there is no specific bar or prohibition on

grant of bail under section 497 Cr.P.C.; that

detention of the petitioner for an indefinite

period in the circumstance would be unjustified

and against the provision of law; that the Code

being a general criminal procedural law is not

only applicable to Pakistan Penal Code, but its

application is extended by virtue of S.5 (2)

Cr.P.C. to all Special Laws and where the

Special Statue is silent on a point the provision

of the Code can be pressed in to service; that the

preamble of the Ordinance provides for speedy

trial of offences committed in respect of banks,

therefore, petitioner is entitled to be released on

bail on statutory ground.

3. Conversely, learned DAG conceded the

applicability of S.497 Cr.P.C. and contended

that in light of plethora of judgments of the

august Apex Court, that there would be no bar in

having recourse to the provisions of general law

when a special statute is silent on a point. He,

however, requested that if some specific time is

provided to the prosecution, trial would be

concluded in the same.

4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. Before to dilate upon the case of

the petitioner to be a fit case for bail on statutory

ground, I would like to first meet the question as

to whether provision of third proviso to S.497

Cr.P.C. can be pressed in to service, when the

Special law, is silent on the subject qua release

of an accused. S.5 of the Offences in Respect of

Banks (Special Courts) Ordinance, 1984, deals

with the procedure of a Special Court. It

regulates the manner of taking cognizance of

any scheduled offence, adjournment of a case

during the trial, re-call and re-hearing of the

evidence and recording of evidence in absence

of the accused. Sub-section (6) pertains to

release of accused on bail which is reproduced

below:-

“S. (6) An accused person shall

not be released on bail by a

Special Court, or by any other

Court, if there appear

reasonable grounds for

believing that he has_ been

guilty of a scheduled offence,

nor shall an accused person be

so released unless the

prosecution has been given

notice to show cause why he

should not be so released”.

Sub-Section (8) of S.5 of the Ordinance, 1984,

lays down that “A Special Court shall, in

matters with respect to which no procedure

has been prescribed by this Ordinance follow

the procedure prescribed by the Code for the

trial of cases by Magistrates”.

6. Perusal of S.5 (6) of the Ordinance

indicates that it does not place an absolute bar

on allowing bail to an accused charged with a

scheduled offence under the Ordinance. It is

now a well settled law that bail is a rule and is

not to be withheld by way of punishment. S.5

(6) of the Ordinance provides for allowing bail

to an accused by a Special Court. This is an

enabling section. This section or any other

provision of the Ordinance does not indicate that

the powers of a Court have been taken away to

grant bail to an accused under section 497

Cr.P.C.. A Special Court can allow bail to an

accused charged with a scheduled offence even

if there are reasonable grounds to believe that he

is guilty of the charged offence, inter alia, on the

grounds of age, sickness or infirmity, delay in

completion of the trial, if it is found to be a case

of further inquiry, if there is no likelihood of

tampering with the evidence by the accused or

that the continued detention of the accused may

hamper his defence. Offences in Respect of

Banks (Special Courts) Ordinance, has been

promulgated in 1984. S.5 (6) and (7) of the

Ordinance regulating the grant or refusal of bail

is in consonance with S.497 Cr.P.C. The only

difference is that the Ordinance of 1984 place

bar on the release of an accused, against whom

reasonable grounds exist that he has been guilty

of a “scheduled offence”, while the Code place

bar on the release of an accused if there appears

reasonable grounds for believing that he has

been guilty of an offence punishable with death

or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for ten

years, therefore, all other parts and amendments

whenever made to S.497 Cr.P.C., would be fully

applicable to the Ordinance, 1984. The words

mentioned in S.5 (6) of the Ordinance, 1984 are

similar to the words used in Section 21-D of the

Anti Terrorism Court, 1997, but even then the

Courts are entertaining and grant bail to the

accused under the provisions of S.497 Cr.P.C.

Same is the position of section 5-A of

Suppression of Terrorist activities (Special

Courts) Act, 1975. The Hon’ble Supreme Court

in case titled, “The State Vs Syed Qaim Ali

Shah” (1992 SCMR 2192) has held that High

Court has the power to press into service

8.497 Cr.P.C. with its provisos during the

pendency of trials before the Special Court”.

The Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 though was

meant primarily to regulate the investigation,

inquiry and trial under the Pakistan Penal Code,

1860 (in terms of S.5(1) Cr.P.C., but it stipulates

an exception in terms of $.5(2) Cr.P.C. Mandate

of S.5 (2) Cr.P.C. is that persons who are

proceeded against under Special Law shall be

dealt with and their cases inquired into,

investigated and tried according to the procedure

laid down in the said special law. In case where

an enactment provides a special procedure only

10

for some matters then such maters would be

dealt with according to the procedure laid down

in said Special Law, but where the Special law is

silent, the provision of Criminal Procedure Code

1898, shall apply. Again the Control of Narcotic

Substance Act, 1997 is a Special Law and S.51

of the same particularly deals with the bail, but it

has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in

case titled, “Gul Zaman Vs the State” (1999

SCMR 1271) that notwithstanding the bar

contained in 8.51 of the Control of Narcotic

Substance Act, 1997, bail could be granted to an

accused person. Applicability of $.496, 497 and

498 Cr.P.C. was held not totally barred in

respect of cases under the said Act/ Special Law.

Same is the view of the Apex Court in case titled

“The State through Deputy Director Anti-

Narcotic Force, Karachi Vs Syed Abdul

Qayyum” (2001 SCMR 14). Thus, the

11

conclusion of the learned Special Court that

section 5 (6) of the Ordinance imposes absolute

bar on grant of bail cannot be accepted. In

Himesh Khan’s case (2015 SCMR 1092), the

petitioner who was charged under National

Accountability Ordinance, 1999, where the

provisions of S.497 Cr.P.C. have been

specifically ousted, was granted bail by the

Apex Court on the ground of delay in

conclusion of his trial. For convenience the

relevant part of the judgment is reproduced

below:-

“True that the statutory law on the

subject under’ the National

Accountability Ordinance, 1999

does not recognize the grant of bail

to accused persons facing charges

under the said law, however, in the

case of Khan Asfandyar Wali Vs

12

Federation of Pakistan through

Cabinet Division (PLD 2001 SC

607), the Supreme Court has

devised a strategy for granting bail

to such persons through

constitutional jurisdiction of the

High Court provided their cases

are arguable for the purpose of

grant of bail.

The Court cannot lightly ignore

shocking delay in the conclusion of

the trial of an accused person,

provided he or they is/are not

exclusively responsible for the

Same. .....

Pakistan is a welfare State where

liberty of individual has_ been

guaranteed by the Constitution

beside the fact that speedy trial is
13

inalienable right of every accused

person, therefore, even if the

provision of S.497 Cr.P.C. in

ordinary course is not applicable,

the broader principle of the same

can be pressed into service in

hardship cases to provide relief to

a deserving accused person

incarcerated in jail for a

shockingly long period”.

7. The petitioner is behind the bars

since 07.11.2013, till date, but even charge has

not been framed against him. According to

record, the delay caused in conclusion of his

trial cannot be attributed to the petitioner as it

was because of the lethargic attitude of the

prosecution, therefore, petitioner cannot be left

at the mercy of the prosecution to rotten in jail

for indefinite period. The inordinate delay in

14

conclusion of his trail cannot be lightly ignored

as the same has not been caused by his act or

omission. It has been held by the Hon’ble

Supreme Court in Riasat Ali’s case (PLD 1968

SC 353), that delay in prosecution of accused

amounts to abuse of process of law and is a valid

ground for bailing out accused, however, delay

in prosecution of each case as a ground for bail

is to be weighed and judged, in each case on its

merits. This is a classic case where the trial has

been delayed and the delay is attributed either to

the State or the complainant. The right to a fair

trial is guaranteed under Article 10-A of the

Constitution and the most essential constituent

of a fair trial is to conclude the same

expeditiously and without delay. The right to a

fair trial is not merely restricted to the accused,

but the complainant as well. The purpose of

avoiding delay is to ensure that the sanctity of

15

the proceedings remain protected which

inherently includes securing credible evidence.

Delay defeats the ends of justice and may

seriously undermine the possibility of a fair trial.

Delay in a trial results in an inherent risk of

undermining and eroding the credibility of the

evidence, as human memory is impaired with

the passage of time; witnesses may not be

traceable or documents may get lost. It is for this

reason that the edifice of criminal law is

premised on the principle that trials must be

concluded within a reasonable time,

expeditiously and without unnecessary delay.

Delay in any trial, but in criminal trial in

particular, is intolerable. The preamble of the

Ordinance, 1984 provides for speedy trial of

offences committed in respect of banks,

therefore, keeping in view the preamble of the

Ordinance, 1984, trial in the schedule offences is

16

to be concluded much earlier than as provided in

the third proviso to section 497 Cr.P.C.

8. In light of the above discussion and

deriving wisdowm from the judgments of the

Apex Court, I am of the considered view that it

is a fit case for grant of bail on statutory ground.

Besides, petitioner is a sweeper in the Bank

where some gold of the Bank has been

misappropriated while co-accused Zia Ullah

Shah and Abdul Hameed Khan, the Manager

and Casher, respectively, the custodian of the

Bank, have been granted bail on statutory

ground, therefore, on the doctrine of consistency

and under Article 25 of the Constitution that all

citizen are equal before law and are entitled to

equal protection of law, the petitioner is also

entitled to concession of bail.

9. According,, this petition is allowed.

Accused/petitioner is admitted to bail.

17

10. These are reasons of my short order of

even date.
