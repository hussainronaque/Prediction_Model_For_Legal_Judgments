It was opined by the Investigating Officer that the appellant
and his wife did not own or possess any inherited property
so as to justify acquisition of the above mentioned
properties in his name or in the names of his
dependents/benamidars. Final report/Challan in terms of
section 173 Cr.P.C., was was submitted before the
Chairman NAB Islamabad, upon which a Reference was
submitted against the appellant and his wife Mst. Nuzhat
Shaheen Babar (co-accused) before the learned Trial Court,
where they were formally charge sheeted to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. To prove its case, the
prosecution examined as many as forty witnesses and after
closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of the
accused were recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C. wherein
they denied the charged and claimed the properties in their
name to have been acquired by them through legal income
which they had earned from their salaries, other service
benefits, pensions and sale and purchase of various plots
on profit. In their defence, the accused also produced

eleven witnesses. On conclusion of trial, the learned trial

court acquitted co-accused Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar,
however, convicted and sentenced the appellant Sanaullah
Babar vide impugned judgment dated 07.08.2009. The
properties of the appellant and co-accused Mst. Nuzhat
Shaheen Babar and Mudassar Babar were, however,
forfeited in favour of the State through the impugned
judgment, hence, this appeal.

3. During pendency of the appeal, the appellant died
and on 09.03.2011, the following order was passed by this

Court:-

“The former produced the death certificates with
regard to appellant Sanaullah Babar, photo copies of
which are placed on record as Exh.PA and Exh.PA/1.
Accordingly, the prosecution, to the extent of
conviction and sentence of the appellant stands
abated, however, legal question has to be resolved, as
to whether the NAB can still chase the property of the
deceased to recover the fine amount and whether the
legal heirs of the deceased-appellant could be
deprived of inheritance and whether the principles of
detachment would be also attracted at the appellate
stage, moreso, when the judgment of conviction was
under suspension”.

4. Legal heirs of the deceased appellant also filed
Cr.Misc. No.33/2011 for their impleadment in light of
judgment dated 20.09.2011, rendered by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in Cr.A. No.170/2003, titled, “Ghani ur

Rehman Vs NAB), which was allowed vide order dated
01.03.2012 and accordingly the legal heirs of the deceased
were arrayed as appellants in the appeal.

5. Because the properties of Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen
Babar and Mudassar Babar, widow and son of the
appellant, were also forfeited through the impugned
judgment dated 07.08.2009, therefore, they have filed Writ
Petition _No.3703-P/2017__and_WP__No.2308-P/2009,
resultantly, for setting aside of the impugned judgment to
the extent of confiscation of their properties.

6. Since, the appeal and the writ petitions are arising
out from one and the same judgment of the learned trial
Court, therefore, we propose to decide the same through
this single judgment.

7. We have heard the exhaustive arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and record perused with
their able assistance.

8. Allegation against the deceased appellant was that
he while serving as a Superintendent Engineer in
Communication & Works Department Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, accumulated movable &
immovable properties in his own name and in the names of
his wife Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar (co-accused) as well
as in the names of his other deponents and benamidars,
value of which was disproportionate to his known sources
of income. Detail of the alleged properties has been given

in earlier part of the judgment.
9. No doubt, under section 14 (c ) of the NAO 1999,
in any trial of an offence punishable under clause (v) of
subsection (a) of section 9 of the Ordinance, the fact that
the accused person or any other person on his behalf is in
possession of properties, for which the accused person
cannot satisfactorily account of his known sources of
income or that such person has, at or about the time of the
commission of the offence with which he is charged,
obtained an accretion to his pecuniary resources or property
for which he cannot satisfactorily account, the Court shall
presume, unless the contrary is proved, that the accused
person is guilty of the offence of corruption and corrupt
practices and his conviction therefore shall not be invalid
by reason only that it is based solely on such a presumption.
However, every accused who faces trial in the
Accountability Court or against whom a Reference has been
sent, the presumption as envisaged in section 14 of NAO
1999 cannot be taken into account and the accused person
cannot be convicted for the simple reason that section 14
NAO 1999, is couched in a language that accused shall be
considered and presumed as guilty. The proposition
regarding shifting of burden on accused person under the
above section of law, for the first time came before the

worthy Sindh High court in Hakim _Ali_Zardari’s

case__(2007_ MLD 910) wherein the Court while
dilating upon the provisions of section 9(a)(v) & 14 (c) of
the NAO, 1999, observed as under:-

“As regards the burden of proof, the normal rule of law
is that an accused is presumed to be innocent until his
guilt is proved, established and the onus of establishing
the guilt is always on the prosecution. But the rule of
law laid down in section 14© of the Ordinance is a
departure from normal law and under this section a
presumption of corruption and corrupt practices is
required to be drawn, if the accused or any person on
his behalf is in possession of pecuniary resources or
property disproportionate to his known sources of
income of which sources he cannot satisfactorily
account. For shifting the burden upon accused to
account for the sources of income, the words of the
statue are preemptory and the burden must lie all the
time on the accused to prove the contrary, after the
conditions laid down in the earlier part of the section
have been fulfilled by the prosecution through evidence
to the satisfaction of the Court and then the Court is
required to draw the presumption that the accused
person is guilty as provided under section 14© of the
Ordinance. Such presumption continues to hold the
field unless the Court is satisfied that the statutory
presumption has been rebutted. The onus upon the
accused is not as strict as the initial onus as the
presumption which has first to establish the
disproportion between the properties held by the
accused and the known sources of his income. But

where from the facts the disproportion was not
10

satisfactorily explained by the accused it could not be
said that excessive burden was thrown on him to
explain the disproportion. A reference is invited to
Rameswar Parsad Upadhya Vs the State of Bihar (AIR
1971 SC 2474). Thus, the nature and extent of the
burden cast on the accused is that he is not bound to
prove his innocence beyond any reasonable doubt,
therefore, while examining the explanation of the
accused the above principle is required to be kept in
view and if the accused is able to explain the
circumstances to the satisfaction of the court then that
will be enough to discharge the burden.”

10. Taking the case in hand at the touch stone of the
principle referred in the judgment (supra) of the august
apex court, we would evaluate the prosecution’s evidence
so as to determine whether it has successfully performed its
primary duty, if, yes, whether the appellant by rebutting the
prosecution evidence has proved otherwise.

Pirpai Nowshera and five Kanals at village Ormar Peshawar
which is in possession of the tenants.

15. Perusal of the evidence led by the prosecution
reveal that the same is sufficient only to prove the
immovable properties owned by the appellant and his
widow Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen and son Mudassar Babar, out
of which some properties have devolved upon them by
operation of law i.e. through inheritance and some have
been purchased by them by making payment in lump sum
and installments, however, an iota of evidence to the effect
that these properties have been acquired by the appellant in
his own name and in the names of his dependents by
misappropriating the Government funds/money by
misusing their officials capacity. Single instance has not
been brought on record to show that the appellant ever
remained involved during his service in any kind of corrupt
practices. Contrary, the sources on the basis of which the
appellant and his deponents have acquired properties have
been plausibly explained by the appellant and his widow
Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar by producing evidence in their
defence whereby the allegation leveled against them in the
Reference were rebutted through cogent documentary
proof/evidence. According to defence evidence Zaka Ullah

and was promoted as an Associate Professor. The appellant
had extra advantage of having at his disposal the pay and

Rs.9,00,000/- and the same was sold by him in the same
year in lieu of Rs.10,00,000/-. Commercial Shop No.50 in
Beverley Plaza Blue Area Islamabad was purchased by the
appellant in the year 1992 in lieu of Rs.10,67000/- and sold
the same in lieu of Rs.24,00,000/- in the year 2001. The
sale price of the above mentioned plot was paid by the
appellant in installments. Record depicts that Plot No.77-E
measuring 1.86 Kanal at Rehman Baba road University
Town Peshawar was purchased by the late father of the
appellant in 1972 in lieu of Rs.7000/- on which he also

kanals 5 marls land in Mauza Urmar Payan Peshawar in the
name of son of the appellant Mudassar Babar was the
ancestral property of the appellant. The said property was
gifted to Mudassar Babar by all legal heirs of Zakaullah
Khan late for the purpose of getting education in England,
however, the said property was later on sold in lieu of

Rs.15,40,000/- and an account in TSB LIOyds Bank
21

London was opened and son of the appellant Mudassar
Babar studied in England.

16. Like appellant, Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar has
also explained legal sources of her income on which she has
acquired the movable and immovable properties in her
name. According to record she is the daughter of Khisro
Khan who was serving in Railway before partition of
Pakistan having a house in Sirki Gat Peshawar City, known
as Babar Manzil. Her father had also purchased a house in
Chinar Lane, Peshawar in 1966 and a bungalow 31-A the
Mall Nowshera Cantt which he was holding as an old grant
lessee. In this view of the matter he by all standards was a
man of resources. Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar joined
Education Department as a lecturer in 1978 and was
promoted as Assistant and Associate professor. Perusal of
the evidence led by the deceased appellant in defence
depicts that he has plausibly explained each and every
property in his name and in the names of his son and widow
Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar. Similarly, the account of
sources of income furnished by them appeal to a prudent
mind that the appellant and Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar
were having sufficient sources of income on which they
could purchase the properties. Besides, as stated earlier,
most of the properties which are a bit expensive have been
purchased by the appellant and his widow after their

retirements from service. It does appeal to a prudent mind
22

that they being guzatted Officer would have received
handsome pension. Similarly, details of the properties
purchased and sold by the appellant reveal that the spouses
have purchased land and plots on meager amount and have
sold out the same on handsome price, which boost their
income quickly. The findings of the learned trial Court with
regard to guilt of the appellant are based on mere
presumptions and assumption. It is settled law that
assumptions and presumptions how high may be cannot be
a substitute of evidence. The deceased appellant through
evidence led by him in defence has successfully rebutted
the allegation of the prosecution and the prosecution has
failed to prove its case through cogent and confidence
inspiring documentary and oral evidence. A shred of
evidence has not been brought by the prosecution to prove
corruption and corrupt practices of the appellant and his
wife while they were serving in the service of Pakistan. In
this view of the matter, the impugned judgment is not
sustainable in the eye of law.

17. Accordingly, this appeal and the connected Writ
Petitions No.2308-P and 3703-P of 2009 and 2017,
respectively, filed by Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar and
Mudassar Babar, are allowed, consequently, the impugned
judgment dated 07.08.2009 to the extent of sentence of fine
and forfeiture of properties in the name of the deceased

appellant and his dependents including his widow
23

Mst. Nuzhat Shaheen Babar and son Mudassar Babar, is
hereby set-aside.
