State by: Mr. Arshad Ahmad AAG.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J:- Through this single
judgment, I intend to dispose of Cr.MBA No.2933-
P/2017 alongwith connected Cr.MBA No.07-P/2017,
filed by petitioners Salman Ghazanfar, Muhammad |
Riaz, Mst. Naila, Zeeshan, Mst. Shahida, Mst. Mehwish
and Mst. Kiran as both the petitions are outcome of one
and same FIR No.941 dated 18.12.2017 u/ss 371-A, B
PPC, Police Station Gulberg, Peshawar.

2. The prosecution case as set forth in the FIR

is that there was general complaint regarding running a
brothel house in the Flat of Mst.Naila w/o Muhammad
Riaz, Zeeshan s/o Muhammad Riaz & Muhammad Riaz
s/o Musharaf Din. On 18.12.2017 at 21.30 AM, the
complainant was on gasht when in the meanwhile, he
received information about presence of males and
females in the aforesaid Flat in objectionable condition.
Acting upon the said information, complainant
alongwith other police officials including a lady
constable raided the said Flat where a man and a

woman were found in objectionable condition. They

‘were arrested on the spot. On query the woman

disclosed her name as Mehwish w/o Muhammad Afzal
while man disclosed his name as Salman Ghazanfar s/o .
Ghazanfar Ali. In the said flat three other women were
also present who disclosed their names as Mst.Naila
w/o Muhammad Riaz, Mst. Shahida daughter of Yousaf,
Mst. Kiran daughter of Bashir Ahmad and one male
Zeeshan s/o Muhammad Riaz. All the above named
accused were arrested on the allegation of running
prostitution den/ brothel house in the said flat. The
murasila was drafted and sent to the Police Station for

registration of the FIR. All the accused were declined
post arrest bail by learned Additional Sessions Judge-
VIL Peshawar vide order dated 22.12.2017, hence these
petitions.

3. It was argued by learned counsel for
petitioners that Sections 371-A & 371-B PPC are not
applicable to the present case; that on the face of
record the prosecution story is false and unbelievable.
He lastly argued that the matter requires further probe
into the guilt of petitioners.

4. On the other hand, learned AAG
representing the State, argued that petitioners were
arrested red handed on the spot for committing a
heinous offence involving moral turpitude; that
Sections 371-A & 371-B PPC are applicable to the case
of petitioners; that the offences with which petitioners
are charged, falls under the prohibitory clause of
Section 497(1) Cr.PC therefore, petitioners do not
deserve the concession of bail.

5. I have heard arguments of learned counsel
for the parties and gone through the record with their

valuable assistance.
6. Perusal of record reveals that Sections 371-
A & 371-B PPC only apply to those persons who sell or
buy any person with intend that such person would be
used for the purpose of prostitution or illegal sexual
intercourse but there is no such allegation against
petitioners. The only allegation against petitioners is
that petitioners Salman Ghazanfar and Mst. Mehwish
were found in objectionable condition while the rest of
petitioners were present inside the Flat. The FSL report
of Mehsiwh regarding semen analysis on Shalwar and
vaginal swabs are negative according to Report
No.1044/17/KMC/17. Likewise, the FSL report of
petitioner Salman Ghazanfar reflects that the swabs for
semen is negative while positive for semen on Shalwar.
7, The place where raid was conducted by
police on spy information was not public place but was
owned and in possession of a private individual.
Neither any search warrant was obtained by police nor
any effort was made by police in that behalf. No
respectable from the locality was associated in the
impugned raid proceedings. The alleged police raid in

such a situation could not be termed any better than an
“intrusion” which was an act prohibited by the
Constitution, Law and the Holy Quran. The Law does
not permit the registration of a case under the Offence
of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, on
the report of a "Mukhbar" because this Ordinance has
to be read in conjunction with the Offence of Qazf
Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979 and "Mukhbar”
being entitled to have his name and identity kept
secret, this would allow him to even make false
imputations of Zina with impunity which would defeat
the very spirit and purpose of both Enactments. Such
act would not be in conformity with the spirit of Surah
Hujrat, Ayat 6 and guidelines provided by the Holy
Quran in this behalf. Legislators in their wisdom having
regard to the existing norms of society were conscious
of the fact that if cases under such offences were
permitted to be registered on spy information or on the
complaints lodged by anonymous persons, such
practice would have encouraged false reports involving
innocent men or women for ill designs. The police
officials by not obtaining search warrant for raiding the

house in question has committed glaring illegality by
not following the mandatory provisions of Section 103
Cr.PC and also violated Article 14 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Police functionaries could
not be permitted to flout the provisions of law, which
otherwise would amount to derailing the entire judicial
system. Moreover, Sections 371-A & 371-B PPC are not
applicable under the attending circumstances of the
case due to lack of evidence in respect of selling and
purchasing a person for the purpose of prostitution
therefore, case of petitioners squarely falls within the
purview of Section 497(2) Cr.PC.
8. For what has been discussed above, both
the bail petitions referred above are allowed and all the
petitioners are admitted to bail provided they furnish
bail bonds to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Ilaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate concerned.

The above are reasons of my short orders
of even date.
