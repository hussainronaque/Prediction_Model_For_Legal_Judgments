SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- The petitioners namely

Safaidullah Shah and Imran Ali Shah through the

instant petition seek their post arrest bail in crime

report No.369 dated 30/11/2010, registered under

sections 302/324/34 PPC at Police Station

Ghoriwala, district Bannu.

2 The prosecution story as given in the crime

report, is that on 30.11.2010, the complainant Andaz

Ali Khan at about 2150 hours brought the dead body

of his brother Barkat Khan to the Civil Hospital Bannu
and lodged report to the effect that on same night he
was present in his house and his brother Barkat Khan
informed him that accused/petitioners Safaidullah and
Imran had snatched articles from him, so he wanted to
make a complaint to their parents; that complainant,
deceased and one Dil Robaz Khan proceeded towards
the house of accused/petitioners, however, when they
reached near the houses of one Rizwan, the accused/
petitioners emerged; that accused/petitioner Safaidullah
made firing at Barkat Ali ( brother of complainant ) and
accused/petitioner Imran made firing at complainant,
resultantly they both were hit and got injured. The
accused/petitioners decamped from the spot after the
occurrence. Both the injured were taken to the hospital,
but Barkat Ali succumbed to the injuries on the way to
the hospital. Hence, the accused/petitioners were

booked in case FIR ( ibid).

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

3. After arrest, the petitioners applied for
post arrest, which was declined by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IV Bannu, vide order
dated 02-07-2018. Hence, this petition.

4. It has been contended by the learned
counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners are
innocent and have falsely been implicated merely
on the basis of suspicion; that the alleged occurrence
took place in the darkness of night, and the
complainant has not disclosed the source of light in
which the petitioners were identified, therefore,
identification of accused was not possible; that the
PM report of the deceased discloses charring marks
on his body which is in conflict with the distance
shown in the site plan; that mere abscondence of the
petitioners would not disentitle them to the
concession of bail; that the prosecution case requires
further probe into the guilt of the petitioners,

therefore, they deserve the concession of bail.

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

5. Conversely, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant and the
learned A.A.G representing the State vehemently
opposed the contention of the learned counsel for
the petitioners and argued that the petitioners have
specifically been charged for committing murder of
brother of the complainant and also causing injuries
to the complainant; that the parties are residents of
one and the same area and distance between the
accused and complainant party, as shown in the site
plan, are very close to each other, therefore, there
was no chance of mis-identification; that after
commission of offence the petitioners remained at
large for a noticeable period which lends further
support to the case of prosecution and that after
arrest of the accused, Challan has been submitted
and the trial has already been commenced, so at this
stage, petitioners are not entitled to the concession

of Bail; that the medicolegal report, site plan

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

and version of the complainant, if placed in a
juxtaposition, are consistent, inter alia; that the
offence with which the petitioner is charged, falls
within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C,
therefore, they do not deserve the concession of
bail.

6. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their valuable assistance.

7. Perusal of the record reveals that the
FIR was lodged with promptitude wherein the
petitioners have specifically been nominated for
committing murder of brother of the complainant
and effectively firing at the complainant. Admittedly
the parties are co villagers and the distance between
the accused and complainant party are short,
therefore, there was no chance of mis identification,
though the occurrence has taken place at night time.

After commission of offence, they remained at large

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

for more than seven years and were declared
proclaimed offenders.

8. The crime in question having taken
place on 30-11-2010, the petitioners were arrested
on 27.09.2017, they remained absconders for more
than 7 years and were declared as proclaimed
offenders. It is settled law that fugitive from law
loses some of the normal rights granted by the
procedural and substantive law and noticeable
abscondence disentitles the absconder to the
concession of bail, notwithstanding the merits of the
case. In this behalf reliance can be placed on the
case reported as “Muhamad Sadiq..Vs..Sadiq and
others (PLD 1985 SC 182). In this case bail
allowed by Peshawar High Court Abbott Abad
Bench was cancelled by the august Supreme Court
of Pakistan, wherein unexplained noticeable
abscondence of six months of the accused was

found, same view was expressed by their Lordship

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

in the cases titled “Awal Gul ..Vs..Zawar Khan_&
others (PLD 1985 SC 402) & Ibrahim..Vs..Hayat
Gul & others (1985 SCMR 382) and Raza Fazal-
ur-Rehman..Vs.. Muhammad Afzal & other (2010
SCMR 179).

9. In this case certain points have been
agitated by the learned counsel for the petitioner, i,e
presence of charring marks on the body of the
deceased, despite the fact that distance between
accused and deceased was shown as four paces,
which essentially touches the merits of the case. It is
not denied that deeper appreciation or evaluation of
material at the stage of bail is not permissible for the
grant or refusal of bail and only tentative assessment

is to be made, In this respect reliance is placed on

the case reported as “Mumtaz Vs..The State (2012
SCMR __556) and Abdullah __Hayee_& two

others.. The State (1996 SCMR 556) .

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

In this behalf reference may also be
made to the case reported as Raza Khan ..Vs.. The
State through Advocate General Peshawar &
another (2013 MLD 810).

10. It is pertinent to mention here that after
completion of investigation challan has been
submitted and the trial has been commenced. In such
situation, it has all long been settled principle of law,
set by august Supreme Court of Pakistan, when the
trial is likely to commence or has begun, bail
application should not be decided on merits and the
matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may prejudice
case of either side. In this respect, reliance can well
be placed on the cases reported as Muhammad
Sadiq and others Versus The State ( 1980
SCMR 203), Muhammad Ismail..VS.. Muhammad
Rafique & other (PLD 1989 SC 585), Mian Dad

Vs. The State and another (1992 SCMR_ 1418),

Said Akbar and another Vs Gul Akhtar & another

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

(1992_SCMR_931) and Shahid Faroog Vs..The
State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).

11. In view of specific charge supported by
the eye-witnesses, medical evidence and un-
explained noticeable abscondence sufficiently
provide reasonable grounds to believe that the
petitioners are guilty of an offence charged with,
which falls within the prohibitory Clause of Section
497 Cr.P.C.

12. For what has been discussed above,
there is no merits in this petition, which is hereby
dismissed.

It is clarified that any observations
made in this order is tentative in nature, confined
only to the extent of bail matter which would not
influence the mind of the trial Court in any manner
who shall decide the case by applying its own

independent judicial mind after recording evidence.

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

13. The learned trial Court is directed to
conclude the trial expeditiously but not later than six
months. The office is directed to send the
requisitioned record forthwith.
