LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal and the Murder Reference are
directed against the judgment
dated 19.4.2016 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda delivered in
case FIR No.171 dated 21.05.2004
u/s 302 PPC of Police Station Nisatta
District Charsadda, whereby the appellant
has been convicted and sentenced to death
u/s 302 (b) PPC with direction to pay
Rs.100,000/- as compensation to the legal
heirs of the deceased or in default whereof
to further suffer 6 months simple

imprisonment with benefit u/s 382-b Cr.P.C.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on

21.05.2004, complainant Bagh Zadin
reported to SHO Murad Ali Khan (PW-12)
on the spot of the case to the effect that on
the day of occurrence after offering Jumma
prayer, he, his son Laam Zer Gul, Majid Gul
(PW-7) and Ayaz (abandoned) had come to
the hujra of Nawaz Khan. His son was
asleep on a cot while he, Majid Gul and
Ayaz were sitting in the hujra when in the
meanwhile appellant-accused Khan Munir
came there and after taking out dagger from
his folder, killed his son by slitting his throat.
Motive was stated to be a verbal altercation
having been taken place between the
deceased and the appellant on the day of

occurrence.

3. It is worth to mention that after
commission of the offence, the appellant
went into hiding and consequently
proceedings u/s 512 Cr.P.C. were initiated

against him.

4. On arrest of the appellant, complete
challan was put in court which indicted him
for commission of the offence to which he
pleaded not guilty and claimed _ trial.
Prosecution in order to prove its case
examined 13 witnesses in all whereafter

statement of the accused was recorded,
wherein, he professed his innocence. The
learned trial court, after conclusion of the
trial, found the appellant guilty of the charge
and while’ recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above, hence

the instant appeal.

5. Arguments heard and record gone
through.
6. Perusal of the case record would

show that complainant of the case, namely,
Bagh Zadin did not appear before the court
and the reason given by the prosecution for
his non-appearance was his infirmness and
incapability to give evidence. The learned
trial court, however, vide order
dated 28.9.2015 allowed the prosecution to
bring on record the’ statement of
complainant Bagh Zadin, which he had
recorded in the case during the proceedings
u/s 512 Cr.P.C. No doubt, under Article 46
of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order 1984,
statement of a person recorded u/s 512
Cr.P.C. can be transferred to the case
subsequently if he has become incapable to
give evidence but in order to give relevancy
to such statement, it must be proved through

reliable evidence that the person was dead,
infirm or was incapable to testify. In case,
the above conditions are not fulfilled, then
the statement recorded u/s 512 Cr.P.C. of a
person cannot be given any credence for its
having remained un-cross-examined. In the
case in hand, the learned trial court has not
given any reason for allowing the
prosecution to bring the statement of
complainant Bagh Zadin on record of the
case. Whether the complainant was really
incapable to give evidence in the court or
not was a question to be resolved by the
learned trial court by recording some
observation to that effect. Failure to record
reason to the above effect has prejudiced
the prosecution’s case for which it shall
suffer. Though, it was the prosecution’s
stance that the complainant could not attend
the trial court due to his infirmness but as
there is no material on the case file to
support the prosecution’s version qua
infirmness of the complainant, therefore, his
statement recorded u/s 512 Cr.P.C. cannot

legally be considered against the appellant.

7. Prosecution in support of its case
against the appellant has also relied upon

the testimony of Majid Gul, who appeared as
PW-7 before the learned trial court. No
doubt, this witness does not relate to any of
the party but on record there is no material,
which could corroborate his deposition so as
to make it a base for recording conviction.
Neutrality alone of a witness would not be
sufficient to hold that whatever he has
deposed was a true picture of the
occurrence unless his deposition is duly
supported by attending circumstances of the
case. If the evidence furnished by PW-7 is
tested on the touchstone of the above, then
it would appear that same is_ hardly
corroborated by circumstantial evidence of
the case. First, we will look at the conduct of
all the three persons who, according to the
prosecution, were present in the hujra when
the appellant came there, took out dagger
from the folder of his shalwar and killed the
complainant’s son by slitting his throat. The
conduct of all the three is quite unnatural
and cannot be expected from a sensible
man. None of the three prevented the
appellant from committing the offence nor
they raised any hue and cry over the cruel
act. They acted like a silent spectator, which
conduct of theirs casts serious doubt on

their presence on the spot. No doubt, PW-7
and Ayaz were not related to the victim so
as to rescue him but the complainant, being
father, must have come to the help of his
son had he been present on the spot. The
unnatural conduct of the complainant and
PW-7 shows that they were not present on
the spot when the occurrence had taken

place.

8. Furthermore, the deceased was a
young man of 25 years and his slitting
cannot be the job of one person as reported
and deposed by the prosecution witnesses
because slitting of a young man, unless he
is tied with any rope etc, cannot be done by

a single person.

9. Another pronounced aspect of the
case is that the occurrence had taken place
on 1500 hours while the report was made on
1530 hours and as per the testimony of
PW-7, none of the three persons had left the
hujra till arrival of the police on the spot. It is
worth to mention that the police had reached
the spot at 1530 hours i.e. after 30 minutes
of the occurrence. Sitting idle for 30 minutes
by all the three persons on the spot after the
gruesome murder is indicative of the fact

that at the crucial time none of them was
present. Had they been present on the spot,
they must have taken the dead body to the
Police Station for legal proceedings or would
have raised any hue and cry to attract other
people to the spot. Failure to react, as is
expected from a prudent man, shows their
non-presence on the spot at the time of

occurrence.

10. In addition to the above, PW-4 has
admitted in his cross examination that father
of the deceased had reached the spot after
death of the deceased and that he was in
his house. Testimony of PW-4 has negated
what PW-7 has deposed qua presence of
the complainant on the spot at the time of
occurrence and as such testimony of the
sole eyewitness cannot be relied upon for

the safe administration of justice.

11. | Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that the
prosecution has failed to prove its case
against the appellant beyond = any
reasonable doubt, which is a hallmark of
criminal law. The sole eye version account
furnished by PW-7 is not confidence

inspiring, hence cannot be relied upon.
12. True that the appellant has remained
outlaw after commission of the offence but it
has been held umpteenth times by the
superior courts that absconsion of an
accused alone would not be sufficient to
record his conviction as for recording
conviction of a perpetrator, reliable, tangible
and corroborative evidence is required,
which ingredients are very much missing in
the case in hand, therefore, abscondence of

the appellant is of no help to the prosecution.

13. The bottom line of the above
discussion is that the prosecution has not
been able to prove its case beyond any
shadow of doubt against the appellant,
therefore, we are constrained to accept this
appeal, set aside the impugned judgment
and acquit him of the charge leveled against
him. He be set free forthwith, if not required

to be detained in any other case.

14. | The Murder Reference is answered in

negative.

15. Above are the detailed reasons of our
short order of even date, which reads as

under:-
“For the reasons to be recorded later, this appeal
is allowed, conviction and sentence of the
appellant recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-V, Charsadda vide impugned
judgment dated 19.04.2016 delivered in case FIR
No.171 dated 21.05.2004 u/s 302 PPC of
Police Station Nisatta, Charsadda are set aside.
He is acquitted of the charge leveled against him
and be set free forthwith if not required to be
detained in any other case”.
