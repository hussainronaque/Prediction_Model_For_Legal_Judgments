MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.- Muhammad

Saad Naseem Petitioner herein, entrapped in case
FIR No. 1086 dated 04.11.2016 charged under
section 489-F PPC registered at Police Station
Timergara District Dir Lower is optimistic for the

grant of bail after arrest.

2. Prior to, bail application bearing No.
276/4 of the year 2016 was preferred by the
Petitioner for the same relief before the Court of
learned Sessions Judge/Zila Qazi Dir Lower at
Timergara which was dismissed vide the order

dated 14.12.2016, hence this bail petition.

3. The complainant Mohammad Suleman

addressed his application dated 04.11.2016 to the
Nawab

Station House Officer of PS Timergara narrating
his investment with Saad Naseem pertaining to
import & export business by the name of
Apex Heights Private Limited. The
Applicant/complainant was asked to invest his
money. He thereby selling his car IDN 8090 for an
amount of Rs. One million (ten lacs) which was
anon hand by invested and an agreement was
executed to that effect. Later in the year 2015 it was
known that the said Saad Naseem is a swindler who
has already defrauded many people against whom
various cases have been registered in different
Police Stations. On demanding the invested amount
a cheque bearing No. 0983374 for an amount of
Rs. 600,000/- was handed over to the
Applicant/complainant, which was dishonored.
Ergo a request was made for registration of the case

against the said Saad Naseem.

4. Exactly word by word extract of
complaint/application was later made orderly which

is the subject-matter of the FIR ibid.

5. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner on 23.02.2017 as a

request was forwarded to be heard being a
Nawab

practicing lawyer at Islamabad, whereupon his
request was acceded to and he was heard on the
said date. Learned counsel for the complainant has

been heard today, record gone through.

6. Learned counsel for the Petitioner
mainly relied on 2014 SCMR_ 1032 “Muhammad
Sarfaraz vs the State and others” and 2014 SCMR 1034

«a

“ Ghuam Mohy-ud-Din alias Haji Babu vs the State.

The theme is for the grant of bail in offences falling
which do not come within the prohibitory clause of
section 497 (1) Cr.P.C unless and until there is
reason to believe of an exception. Inversely learned
counsel for the complainant is of the view that there
are plethora of cases registered against the
Petitioner and altogether it lead to an inference that
there are exceptions to the grant of bail to the
Petitioner being involved in cases committed fraud

with numerous persons of alike offences.

7. There may be zillion cases being
registered against the accused/Petitioner but there
are copies of the judgments contained in all those
cases placed on record whereby the august
Islamabad High Court Islamabad has extended him

the concession of bail. The record speaks off that
Nawab

even Muhammad Suleman the complainant of this
case is also of dubious character being involved in
case FIR No. 193 dated 22.6.2016 charged under
section 489-F PPC registered at PS Shalimar
Islamabad. He has been extended bail on
08.08.2016 by the Court of learned Duty Additional
Sessions Judge VIII (West) Islamabad. In the case
in hand the Petitioner is said to have committed
fraud when the cheque has been dishonored for an
amount of Rs. 6,00,000/- (six lacs) only but in the
case registered against the complainant he is said to
have issued cheque No. 01643193 for an amount of
Rs. 30,00,000/- (thirty lacs), which amount is five
(5) times bigger than that of the present

accused/Petitioner.

8. Where there are cross claims by
cheaters who exchanged cheques which have been
dishonored there would always be a scope of
further inquiry as to who amongst the rival

claimants has in fact cheated the other.

9. Had there been any exception being
pointed out before this Court, the Petitioner would
have not been entitled to the concession of bail. But

as the punishment for the offence is not falling
Nawab

under the prohibitory clause of section 497 (1)
Cr.P.C, thus the Petitioner be set at liberty subject
to his furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two lacs) with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Trial Court, who shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.
