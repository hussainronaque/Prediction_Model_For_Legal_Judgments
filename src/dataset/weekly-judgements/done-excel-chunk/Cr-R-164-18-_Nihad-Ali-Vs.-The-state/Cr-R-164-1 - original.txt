Se

QAISER RASHID KHAN, J.- Through the instant

revision petition, the petitioner has expressed his grievance

against the judgment and order dated 6.12.2018 of the learned

Additional District & Sessions Judge-III, Mardan, whereby,

his application for reframing of charge against the

accused-respondent in the ordinary court as he was not juvenile

at the time of the commission of the offence has been turned

down.

2. The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently

urges is that the learned trial court did not properly appreciate

Altaf Hussain, PS (SB) Mr, Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
the record while declining the request of the petitioner in

respect of framing of charge against the accused-respondent in

the ordinary court as he was not juvenile at the time of the

commission of the offence. Further contends that the accused-

respondent was major at the time of the commission of the

offence as the occurrence took place on 7.5.2017 while as per

the documentary evidence available on file, his age was over 19

years and as such, the impugned order of the learned trial court

may be set-aside and his case be sent for trial before the court

of competent jurisdiction.

3. The learned counsel for the accused-respondent on

his turn supports the impugned order and states that the charge

was framed against the accused-respondent way back on

29.08.2017, whereby, his age was held to be 15/16 years and he

was tried accordingly. Further contends that the petitioner has

moved the instant application for framing of charge against the

accused-respondent in the ordinary court at the belated stage

when the case is ripe for final arguments. He lastly argues that

the learned trial court has legally framed the charge against the

accused-respondent under the Juvenile Justice System

Altaf Hussain, PS (S.B) Honourable Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
Ordinance, 2000 and proceeded with the trial in accordance

with law.
4. Arguments heard and the available record perused.
5. As per the record, the accused-respondent stands

charged in case FIR No.323 dated 7.5.2017 under section 302

PPC of police station Rustam, District Mardan with the

allegations that he had fired at the complainant namely Akhtar

Ali with which he was hit and later on succumbed to the

injuries. The record further suggests that the accused-

respondent was arrested by the local police on the same very

day i.e. 7.5.2017 and according to the card of arrest, his age is

19 years. It appears that the learned trial court seriously erred

under the law at the time of framing of charge by holding the

accused-respondent as a Juvenile i.e. 15/16 years of age.

On 16.10.2018, during the course of prosecution

evidence, the learned counsel for the petitioner preferred an

application for re-framing of charge against the accused-

respondent in the ordinary court with the plea that he was major

at the time of the commission of the offence. Such application

was turned down by the learned trial court through the

Altaf Hussain, PS (S.B) Honourable Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
impugned judgment and order dated 6.12.2018. Thereafter, on

13.12.2018 the prosecution closed its evidence.

6. When this petition came up for hearing before this

court and keeping in view the contentious issue involved in the

matter in respect of the actual age of the accused-respondent at

the time of the commission of the offence, it was deemed

appropriate to direct for the constitution of a fresh Medical

Board, where the accused-respondent was accordingly

examined on 24.04.2019, which held the age of the accused-

respondent to be 19-21 years. More so, as per the CNIC

issued in the name of the accused-respondent by the NADRA,

his date of birth is 12.03.1998. Likewise, the college card of the

accused-respondent issued by the Government Degree College,

Khair Abad, Mardan, annexed with the instant petition, also

shows his date of birth as 12.03.1998.

The available circumstances and record clearly

suggest that at the time of the commission of the offence, the

accused-respondent was major i.e. over 18 years of age and

thus, should not have been tried by the Juvenile Court under the

Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000.

Altaf Hussain, PS (S.B) Honourable Mr. Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan
7. In view of the foregoing discussion, this criminal

revision petition is allowed, the impugned judgment and order

of the learned trial court dated 6.12.2018 is hereby set-aside and

the case of the accused-respondent is remitted to the ordinary

court for de novo trial in accordance with law.

8. At the tail end of the arguments, the learned

counsel for the accused-respondent requested that ever since the

arrest of the accused-respondent on 7.5.2017, he has been in

perpetual incarceration and that he could not be blamed for his

trial by the learned juvenile court.

In view of such request made by the learned

counsel for the accused-respondent, the learned trial court is

directed to conclude the trial expeditiously.

Announced.
Dated: 10.06.2019.
