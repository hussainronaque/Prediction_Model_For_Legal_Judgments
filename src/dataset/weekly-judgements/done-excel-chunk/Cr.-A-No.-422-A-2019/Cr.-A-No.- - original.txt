FAZAL _SUBHAN, J. Appellant Bakht

Biland son of Zardad has filed the instant
appeal under section 410 Cr. P.C against
the judgment dated: 21.11.2019 passed by
learned Sessions Judge/MCTC, Kolai
Pallas (Kohistan) at Besham in case FIR
No. 33 dated: 14.06.2018 registered under
sections 302, 324, 148, 149 PPC, Police
Station, Battera, District, Kolai Pallas
Kohistan, whereby, appellant was
convicted under section 302 (b) PPC and
sentenced to life imprisonment with fine
of Rs. 5,00,000/-. Half of the fine i.e
2,50,000/- was ordered to be paid to the
legal heirs of deceased Sherin Baha as

compensation within the meaning of
section 544-A Cr. P.C. Appellant was also

R.I with fine of Rs. 50,000/- under section
148/149 PPC.

2. Facts of the case, in brief are, that
on 14.06.2018 at 19:15 hours, Naeem-ud-
Din son of Sarbiland (then injured now
deceased) alongwith dead bodies of Sanor
Khan son of Zardad and Mst. Shreen
Baha wife of Aslam Beigh, reported the
matter to the local police in the crime
house that on the relevant day he
alongwith his father Sarbiland, uncle
Islam-ud-Din and other inmates were
present in their house, when at 6:30 hours,
an altercation took place between his
uncle Sanawar Khan and his maternal
cousin Waseem-ul-Haq on the quarrel of
children and they started abusing each
other. In the meanwhile, Noor
Muhammad, Bakht Biland sons of Zardad
(his uncles), Naeem-ur-Rehman (his
cousin), Bilal and Waseem-ul-Haq

(maternal cousins) duly armed with
Kalashnikoves entered in to his house and
started firing at them, and as a result of
fire shot of Noor Muhammad, his uncle
Sanor Khan got injured on his chest,
whereas, from the fire shot of Bakht
Biland, Mst. Sherin Baha wife of his
uncle Aslam Baig got hit on her chest.
Both the injured died at the spot.
He/complainant also got hit on left thigh
with the fire shot of Bilal, while the other
family members present on the spot had a
narrow escape. On their hue and cry as
well fire shots, residents of muhallah
reached at the spot, whereas, the accused
while making firing decamped from the
spot. As per report of complainant, the
occurrence besides him was witnessed by
his father Sarbiland and uncle Islam-ud-
Din. The report lodged by complainant
Naeem-ud-Din was reduced into murasila
Ex PW-1/1, whereupon, the instant FIR
Ex PW-4/1 was registered. The
complainant was shifted to the THQ,

Besham in injured condition wherefrom,
he was referred to Swat for further
treatment but on his way, he succumbed
to injuries.

3. Initially, the present appellant
remained absconder whereas, co-accused
namely Waseem-ul-Haq and Naeem-ur-
[Rehman were arrested in the case and
faced their trial but due to insufficient
evidence brought against them by the
prosecution, they were acquitted of the
charges levelled against them on
01.04.2019. The appellant was arrested
on 10.04.2019, and after completion of
investigation, case was put in Court for
trial against him. Provision of section
265-C Cr. P.C were complied, where-
after, charge was framed against the
appellant. In order prove its case against
the appellant, prosecution produced
Muhammad Babar Khan SI/SHO as PW-1
who on the report of complainant scribed
the murasila Ex PW-1/1, prepared the
injury sheet (Ex PW-1/2 and Ex PW-1/3)

of both the deceased as well as inquest
reports of all the three deceased Ex PW-
1/4, Ex PW-1/5 and Ex PW-1/6
respectively. PW-2 is the statement of
Shahzada No. 49 P.S, Batera, who
brought murasila report from the spot to
police station for registration of FIR,
while PW-3 Muhammad Naseer SI
prepared the card of arrest (Ex PW-3/1) of
accused and drafted application Ex PW-
3/2 for grant of police custody of accused.
PW-4 Mushtaq Ahmad AMHC (PW-4),
after receipt of murasila incorporated its
contents into FIR Ex PW-4/1 and also
handed over parcels No. 1 to 6 PW
Mohsin No. 241 for delivering to the FSL
authorities vide docit Ex PW-4/2 and on
his return, handed over receipt Ex PW-4/3
to him. PW-5 is the statement of constable
Muhammad Mohsin No. 241, who took
the parcels No. | to 6 to Forensic Science
Laboratory for analysis. PW-6 Mehboob-
ur-Rehman SI on arrest of appellant
conducted the investigation in the case.

He prepared pointation memo Ex PW-6/1.
4. Sarbiland and Islam-ud-Din the
alleged eye witnesses, recorded their
statements as PW-7 and PW-8 reiterating
the story narrated in the murasila/FIR.
PW-9 Zain-ul-Abideen is marginal
witness to the recovery memo vide which
the IO took into possession blood stained
earth and clothes of deceased Naeem-ud-
Din and Sanor Khan. PW-10 Said-ur-
Rehman is the investigating officer of the
case, who conducted detailed
investigation in the case.

5. PW-11 is the statement of Dr.
Sana Ullah MO THQ Besham and
according to him, he conducted external
medical examination of then
injured/complainant as per medical slip
Ex PW-11/1 and verified it to be in his
hand writing and bears his signatures.
PW-12 Masheer Khan son of Sarfaraz, is
the marginal witness to the recovery
memo (Ex PW-10/3) vide which

investigating officer took into possession
blood stained shirt of deceased Mst.
Sherin Baha,

6. With these statements, the
prosecution closed its evidence, where-
after, statement of accused/appellant was
recorded under section 342 Cr. P.C. The
learned trial Court, after hearing
arguments, vide impugned judgment
convicted the appellant as mentioned
above, hence aggrieved from the
judgment/order of conviction and
sentence, he has preferred this appeal.

7. Arguments of learned counsel for
appellant, learned AAG as well as learned
counsel for complainant heard and record
perused.

8. We have given anxious thought to
the arguments advanced by the learned
counsel for the parties and learned AAG
for state and we are of the considered
view that prosecution has remained
unsuccessful in proving the guilt of the
appellant, by host of circumstances, and

we find that the learned trial Court has
failed to properly appreciate the evidence
brought on record in support of
prosecution case.

9. In this case, Naeem-ud-Din son of
Sarbiland had lodged the report,
purportedly, in injured condition and the
murasila Ex PW-1/1 shows his thumb
impression but no one has verified his
report or thumb impression thereon,
confirming that complainant Naeem-ud-
Din had lodged the report, in injured
condition, at his residence. Record
further reveals that after the alleged
occurrence, the complainant then injured
was not shifted to the hospital and
admittedly PW-1, Muhammad Baber
Khan SHO, Batera, on __ getting
information through telephone, himself
visited the spot of occurrence. The
statement of PW-1 Baber Khan reveals
that he prepared injury sheets of the two
deceased Sanor Khan and Mst. Shereen
Baha, Ex PW-1/2 and Ex PW-1/3 and

inquest reports Ex PW-1/4, Ex PW-1/5
and Ex PW-1/6 of Sanor Khan Naeem-ud-
Din (complainant) and Mst. Shereen
Baha. Careful analysis of inquest report
Ex PW-1/5 reveals that there is cutting
and overwriting in column No. 3, in
respect of date and time, wherein, date
and time of death was changed from
14.06.2018 to 15.06.2018 and from 1830
to 0030 hours. When the above inquest
report of complainant and other deceased
are seen in light of the cross-examination
of PW-7 Sarbiland son of Zardad, there is
clear admission that he conveyed the
information of occurrence to PW-1
Muhammad Baber Khan and replied that:
Dd cstleticcttes US Ns tle wh Une

10. Thus, the preparation of inquest
report of Naeem-ud-Din complainant, the
visible tempering in the date and time of
preparation of his inquest report and
admission of PW-Sarbiland Khan clearly
shows that Naeem-ud-Din had already

succumbed to his injuries and that is why,
10

the deceased were not shifted to the
hospital for treatment nor taken to the
police station for loding the report. At the
same time, the above circumstances show
that at the time of arrival of PW-1
Muhammad Baber Khan, all the three
deceased were dead and no injury sheet of
Naeem-ud-Din was prepared and there is
no description of the alleged injuries
sustained by Naeem-ud-Din deceased to
confirm that the injury on his person was
on thigh and that he could talk and had
lodged the report. This clearly arouse
serious doubts about the factum of
lodging of report by the deceased, the
then alleged injured Naeem-ud-Din and
there exist strong circumstance that PW-1
Muhammad Baber Khan SHO, in
connivance and collusion with the
complainant party, had lodged a false and
fabricated report to twist the actual facts
and to make the case one based on dying

declaration, however, facts on record
11

strongly negate the story advanced by
prosecution.

11. | The medical evidence available on
record is also manipulated and distorted
one. PW-11 Dr. Sanaullah MO, has stated
to have examined the injured (alleged)
Naeem-ud-Din vide medical slip Ex PW-
1/1 and his cross-examination is
brimming with admissions that, there is
no mention of the locate of injury in his
report nor he has given time and duration
of examination of injured. He also
admitted that his report is silent about the
oozing of blood from the wound, the
identification mark of the injured and the
police official who brought the injured to
the hospital. This clearly indicates that the
medical evidence was managed and
manipulated to lent support to the
prosecution case. It is also on the record
that the complainant party, in order to
screen of the actual facts from being
surfaced, applied to the police vide

applications Ex PW-1/8 and Ex PW-1/9,
12

for exemption from post-mortem
examination of the deceased, hence, in the
absence of post-mortem report, the nature,
locale, the dimensions of injuries and the
duration/time spent between death and
post-mortem and other relevant facts
relating to the alleged injuries on the
bodies of the deceased, could not be
established, and therefore, the non-
conducting of post-mortem of the
deceased cast serious clouds on _ the
veracity and authenticity of the story
advanced by the prosecution.

12. The spot of occurrence Ex PW-
10/1, as described in the murasila/FIR is
also. shrouded in mystery. In the
murasila/FIR, the spot of occurrence is
mentioned to be the house of complainant
Naeem-ud-Din, and after the occurrence
PW-10 Said ur Rehman/ASI _ OI,
prepared the site plan at the instance and
pointation of PWs Sarbiland and Islam-
ud-Din, however, except one room of

Aslam Baig, no other residential room of
13

the complainant Naeem-ud-Din or any
other member of his family are shown
therein. PW-7 Sarbiland is father of the
deceased Naeem-ud-Din and _ during
cross-examination, he has answered that
his house is at a distance of 3 minutes’
walk from the house of Aslam Baig and
there is a path intervening their houses,
but at the same time, he denied that the
occurrence has taken place in the house of
Aslam Baig. In response to another
question, he answered that in the site plan
(crime house), there is no mention of his
room or the rooms of his brothers
Sarzamin, Rahem-ud-Din and Islam-ud-
Din. On the other hand, PW-8 Islam-ud-
Din, when confronted with the similar
question replied that there is no distance
between his house and the house of
Aslam Baig, because Aslam Baig is
residing with them. PW-10 Said-ur-
Rehman IO/OII, in his cross examination
answered that the room in the site plan is

shown to be that of Aslam Baig and then
14

self-stated that in fact the said room
belonged to Bakht Bilan but due to
mistake it is mentioned to be of Aslam
Baig. From these statements of PWs, it is
evident that the witnesses have not stated
the truth and the spot of occurrence is not
proved to be the house of complainant
and has been falsely shown to be their
house, whereas, the house of complainant
is admittedly at distance of three minutes’
walk from the spot. Here a question arises
that when the spot of occurrence was not
the house of complainant party, then, their
presence on the spot at the relevant time
especially in the month of Ramadan,
seems doubtful.

13. PWs Sarbiland and Islam-ud-Din
have been examined as eye-witnesses of
the occurrence and though in their
examination-in-chief they have stated the
facts about the occurrence in the same
tone, however, on thorough appraisal of
their statements, it is clear that PW-

Sarbiland has informed the police officer
15

Muhammad Babar in respect of the death
of his brother, sister in law and son, but
had shown his ignorance about the
telephone number. At the same time, he
has replied that he informed police officer
Baber about all the three deaths, which is
total negations of his statement that on the
arrival of police, his son Naeem-ud-Din
lodged the report to the police on the spot.
He in cross-examination replied that, his
son Naeem-ud-Din was residing with him
and his deceased brother Sanor Khan was
living separately. He further replied that
he is residing in separate house while his
other four brothers are living separate. He
also confirmed that the house of his
brother Aslam Baig consists of a room,
warandha, godown, kitchen, bath room
and courtyard and that his house is at a
distance of three minutes’ walk from the
house of Aslam Baig. He, in cross-
examination, denied the presence of SHO

Baber Khan when the IO of the case
16

visited the spot on the following day of
occurrence.

14. PW-8 Islam-ud-Din during his
cross-examination answered that the
quarrel over their children took place in
the house of Naeem-ur-Rehman accused
and Naeem-ur-Rehman and Waseem-ul-
Haq each made 2 fires, which hit the
walls. He further replied that there is no
distance between his house and the house
of Asam Baig.

15. From the statements of these PWs,
it is clear that both the alleged eye
witnesses were not consistent in respect of
their residences and they were found
contradictory to one another. It was
noticed that the alleged eye witnesses
were continuously changing their stance
and their statements suffered from willful
improvements and in a bid to prove that
the occurrence had taken place in their
presence, they tried to negate the site
plan, prepared at their own instance and

pointation. The cross-examination of
17

these witnesses shows that all the brothers
have separate houses and the house of
Sarbiland father of the deceased Naeem-
ud-Din is at sufficient distance i.e to be
covered on foot in three minutes, hence,
the presence of these alleged eye
witnesses at the spot of occurrence, is not
natural especially, when the occurrence
took place in the month of Ramadan, and
at a time when people are normally
present in their own houses to break their
fast. There is no __ independent
corroboration available to support the
stance of the two related and interested
witnesses. At the same time, the
statements of these alleged eye witnesses
are neither found convincing nor
confidence inspiring. It is well settled by
now that when statements of eye
witnesses suffer from willful
improvements then reliance on such
tainted evidence cannot be made for
awarding conviction. In arriving to this

conclusion reliance is placed on the case
18

of Muhammad Mansha-Vs-The State,
2018 SCMR, 772 [Supreme Court of

Pakistan], wherein, it has been held that: -

Once the Court comes to the conclusion
that the  eye-witnesses had made
dishonest improvements in _ their
statements then it is not safe to place
reliance on their statements. It is also
settled by this Court that whenever a
witness made dishonest improvement in
his version in order to bring his case in
line with the medical evidence or in
order to strengthen the prosecution case
then his testimony is not worthy of
credence. The witnesses in this case
have also made dishonest improvement
in order to bring the case in line with
the medical evidence (as observed by
the learned High Court), in that
eventuality conviction was not
sustainable on the testimony of the said
witnesses. Reliance, in this behalf can
be made upon the cases of Sardar Bibi
and another v. Munir Ahmad and others
(2017 SCMR 344), Amir Zaman v.
Mahboob and others (1985 SCMR 685),
Akhtar Ali and others v. The State (2008
SCMR 6), Khalid Javed and another v.
The State (2003 SCMR_ 1419),
Mohammad Shafige Ahmad v. The State
(PLD 1981 SC 472), Syed Saeed
Mohammad Shah and another v. The
State (1993 SCMR 550) and Mohammad
Saleem v. Mohammad Azam (2011
SCMR 474).

16. | The prosecution has advanced the

motive for the occurrence to be the
19

quarrel of the children, however, PW-10
Said-ur-Rehman ASI/OI in his cross
examination has presented a motive all
together to the one presented by the
complainant side, who in_ cross
examination replied that the daughter of
Aslam Baig was married to co-accused
Naeem-ur-Rehman and as a custom, he
allowed his wife to visit her parent’s
house for ten days, whereas, she wanted
to stay there for 2 months, which
triggered a quarrel, resulting into the
incident. Thus, the motive advanced by
the complainant/deceased Naeem-ud-Din,
is controverted and dislodged during
investigation conducted by the PW-
Saeed-ur-Rehman ASI/OJI, and therefore,
the appellant, as per record, had no
motive to cause the death of deceased.

17. The prosecution case is that at the
relevant time of occurrence all the five
accused, duly armed with Kalanshinkovs,
entered the house and started firing upon

the complainant party, however,
20

surprisingly, not a single empty was
recovered from the crime house nor any
bullet marks have been shown on the
surrounding walls. This again cast shadow
of doubt about the site of occurrence,
hence, the story advanced by the
prosecution is neither believable nor
proved beyond reasonable doubt. In the
case of Naseeb-ur-Rehman-Vs-Muqarab
Khan and another reported in 2013 MLD,
Peshawar, 836, it was held: -

In view of all these facts, the case of
prosecution is doubtful, which does
not satisfy the judicial conscious of
the Court. For recording conviction
in a capital charge, the evidence
must be of — unimpeachable
character, having no shadow of
doubt. Whenever there is any
reasonable doubt in the prosecution
case, benefit of the same is to be
extended to the accused not as a
matter of grace or concession, but
as a matter of right.

Similarly, in the case of Tajamal Hussain
Shah-Vs-The State, reported as 2022
SCMR, 1567, the August Supreme Court

of Pakistan has held that: -
21

The ocular account in this case
is furnished by Zulfigar Ahmed
(PW-18) and Muhammad Daraz
(PW-19). According to these
PWs of the ocular account, the
petitioner while armed with .30
bore pistol made a straight fire
shot on Muhammad Sajjad,
deceased, which landed on his
chest, due to which he fell down
and ultimately succumbed to the
injury. However, this stance is
contradicted by the medical
evidence. According to Dr.
Raheem Khan (PW-15), who
conducted postmortem
examination of the deceased
Muhammad Sajjad, the injury on
the chest, just above the nipple
of the deceased, was an exit
wound and the margins of the
wound were black whereas the
entry wound was on the back of
the deceased i.e. at thoracic
spine. The blackening around
the wound shows that the fire
shot would have been made from
a close range but according to
the site plan, the petitioner was
shown standing at a distance of
18 steps away from the
deceased. This major
discrepancy raises serious

doubts on the credibility of the
22

prosecution witnesses of the
ocular account.

18. After due consideration of record
we have found that the incident has not
taken place in the mode and manner as
narrated in the FIR rather a fake and
fabricated story was developed to falsely
rope the appellant in the case. The record
was manipulated to show Naeem-ud-Din
as complainant of the case, whereas, it is
proved from the record that police was
informed about the death of all the three
deceased. The ocular evidence has been
found highly inconsistent and unreliable.
Motive of the occurrence has also belied
through evidence and __ therefore,
prosecution has been unable to prove the
guilt of appellant beyond reasonable
doubt, hence, the conviction recorded by
the trial Court/MCTC, Kolai Pallas
(Kohistan) at Besham cannot be
sustained, hence, the appeal filed by the
appellant is accepted and the impugned
judgment is set-aside, and resultantly,

appellant is acquitted in the case. He be
23

set-free, if not required in any other case.
Resultantly, the criminal revision petition
No. 68-A/2019 filed for enhancement of
sentence of life imprisonment into death
has become infructuous, therefore, same
is dismissed, accordingly.

19. Record reveals that co-accused
Noor Muhammad and Hazrat Bilal are
still absconding and after their arrest, they
have to face their trial and their case shall
be considered through the evidence
recorded during their trial, hence, the
observations and findings recorded in this
judgment shall have no bearing on their
trial/case, and trial Court shall be at
liberty to decide their case on the strength
of evidence recorded in the said trial.

20. Above are the detailed reasons of
our short order of even date.
