MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, CJ.- This
is an application under Contempt of Court
Ordinance, 2003 for initiating contempt of
court proceedings against the respondent No. 1
(Aimal Wali Khan) for obstructing and
prejudicing the process of law and due course
of pending judicial proceedings.

2. Pursuant to the Court’s notice,

respondent No. 1 Mr. Aimal Wali Khan,
-2-

Provincial President of the Awami National
Party (ANP) put up his appearance before the
Court, who was also flanked by senior party
leadership, and also a host of lawyers,
mentioned in the heading, herein above.

3. In the very beginning of today’s
proceedings, first Barrister Amir Ullah
Chamkani and later Mr. Sangeen Khan and Mr.
Ahmad Farooq Khattak, Advocates came to the
rostrum and submitted that respondent Mr.
Aimal Wali Khan has complied with Court’s
order and is ready to make a wholehearted
apology subsequent to the situation developed
after his public speech of 21*' December, 2023.
4. It goes without saying that
proceedings are conducted in open court. The
respondent Aimal Wali Khan was let to come
to the rostrum. The Court wanted to confront
the respondent with his speech which had
attracted wide coverage of print and electronic
media including social media and whereby he
made unprovoked malicious speech against the
Chief Justice of this Court and hurled him life
threats also. But respondent side didn’t want to

play the video clip of his speech and pressed on
-3-

submitting that Mr. Aimal Wali Khan feels
remorseful and is ready to make public
apology. It was, however, made profusely clear
that respondent’s utterances patently appear to
undermine the dignity and authority of the
judiciary and are in violation of spirit of the
Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003 which
explicitly prohibits any act or statement that
scandalizes the court or tends to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.
Besides, the threats to life of the Head of the
Provincial Judicature obviously attract
provision of section 6, punishable under section
7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in addition to
entailing disqualification from any public
office under section 70 Sub Section (G) of the
Election Act 2017. While the respondent could
neither deny the entailing consequences of his
speech, nor did he want to play the clip of his
speech either; manifestly to avoid
embarrassment of the unprovoked spiteful
tirade against the provincial head of the
judiciary.

5. It needs no reiteration that society

in general and legal fraternity in particular
Z

-4-

expects magnanimity from a judge in cases
where a condemner seeks unconditional
apology and admittedly courts have been
generous in such cases. In the instant case, it
wasn’t only a matter of scornful statement
ridiculing the Chief Justice of the High Court
and bringing him to disrepute but the
respondent had threatened the Chief Justice
with dire consequences notwithstanding that
this Court has always strived to uphold the ends
of justice without discrimination. But, as the
respondent and his lawyers assured that
respondent hadn’t consciously made the
utterances and that he will make public apology
in a manner that respect and honour of the
Chief Justice and the judiciary will be
emphasized, the Court advised that solemnity
of respondent will be only believed if he
submitted written apology and also expressed
to regret publicly through press conference for
wide publicity. The respondent side readily
agreed to the notion and requested the Court to
wait till the written apology of the respondent
is furnished and clip of his public appearance

sharing his contrition is also transmitted
-5-

whereafter he may be relieved and the petition
be disposed of accordingly.

6. The petition, having been held
back for the stated proceedings, later the
written apology of the respondent Mr. Aimal
Wali Khan “Mark-A” was submitted on his
party letterhead and similarly a video clip was
also transmitted whereby the respondent has

talked straight and made apology in clear

words, which is:

7. This being the situation, the Court,
which though could robustly proceed against
the respondent Aimal Wali Khan, would prefer
to consider and accept his heartfelt apology and
in consideration of extending obeisance/mark
of respect to the nanawatey members as a
corollary, relieve him of the matter.

8. The petition stands disposed of in

the above manner.
