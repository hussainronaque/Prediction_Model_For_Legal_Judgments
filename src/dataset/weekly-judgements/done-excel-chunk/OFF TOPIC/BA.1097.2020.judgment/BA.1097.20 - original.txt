REKK
IKRAMULLAH KHAN, _J:- Through the instant bail

petition, petitioner Afsar Khan seeks his release on bail in case
FIR No. 60/2020 dated 12.4.2020, registered under Section 9-
C/ 15 CNSA 1997, at Police Station ANF, Peshawar, wherein he
is charged for possessing two packets of Charas total weighing
2400 grams, which was recovered by complainant Amir Ullah,
Subedar Chitral Scout Khyber Rifles HQ, from the possession of
petitioner.

2. I have heard learned counsel for petitioner,
learned AAG for the State and gone through the available

record.

3. As per contents of FIR, the petitioner was arrested
by Chitral Scout Khyber Rifles HQ on 12.4.2020 on the
allegation of having in possession of 2400 grams Charas, who
was then handed over to the ANF officials and a case under
Section 9-C CNSA 1997, was registered against him which Act
has already been repealed under Section 59 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019, which

reads as under:-

“39. Repeal and savings.---(1) The Control of
Narcotics Substance Act, 1997 (Act No. XXV

of 1997), to the extent of cultivation,
Possession, selling, purchasing, delivery and
transportation etc. within the Province, to the
extent of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is hereby
repealed,

(2) Notwithstanding the aforesaid repeal,
anything done, action taken, rules made and
notification or order issued under the
aforesaid Act, shall, so far not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to
have been done, taken, made or issued, under
this Act shall have effect accordingly.

4, Later on 31% January 2020, after promulgation of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances
(Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 anew sub-section 3 was added
after sub-section 2 of Section 59, whereby it was provided that:
“Gall the actions taken, proceedings
commenced and things done by the
Department or Police from 4th September
2019 till the commencement of the Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances
(Amendment) Ordinance 2020, shall be

deemed to have been validly taken,
commenced and done under this Act.”

5. Keeping in view the above provisions, it is clear
that all the proceedings done under the repealed Act (Control
of Narcotics Substances Act 1997) were given protection by
the newly amended Ordinance 2020, till 31.1.2020, and
thereafter, no law enforcing agency is empowered to register
cases under the repealed Act in the Province of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa but even then the Seizing Officer handed over
the case to ANF officials instead of local/regular police
available at Khyber, who registered the instant case on
12.4.2020, under the repealed Act, which is against the law.

6. No doubt the Control of Narcotics Substances Act
1997 is still in field in the other parts of the country but in the
province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa presently the newly
promulgated Act is in field and there is nothing on record
which could suggest that the same has been declared ultra
vires or repealed so all the cases relating to arrest, seizure etc
in respect of narcotics are to be registered in this province
under the newly Act (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of
Narcotics Substances Act 2019) until and unless it has been

declared ultra vires or repealed.
7. For what has been discussed above, this bail
petition is allowed and petitioner is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of Rs.200,000/- (Two lac)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate / trial Court concerned,

who shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of

means.
The above are reasons of my short order of even
date.
