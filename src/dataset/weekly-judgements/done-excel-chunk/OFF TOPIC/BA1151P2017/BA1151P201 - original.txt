SHAKEEL AHMAD, J. - Abid Ali, petitioner seeks
post arrest bail in crime report No.206 dated 6.4.2017 under
section 9 (c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997
registered at Police Station, Kalu Khan (Swabi).

2. | Perusal of the record reveals that on 6.4.2017 at
14.30 hours, complainant Hukam Khan ASI alongwith other
police officials were present at Mardan-Swabi road near Nehr
for the purpose of nakabandi, in the meanwhile, a rickshaw
coming from Mardan side was stopped, on search two packet
charas were recovered from toll box of the said rickshaw,
each packet contained 1100 grams charas. The complainant
separated 05/05 grams from each packet of charas for the
purpose of FSL analysis and the same was sealed in parcels
No.1 and 2, while the remaining charas 2190 grams were

sealed in parcel No.3. ‘The driver of the rickshaw disclosed his

name as Abid Ali son of Muhammad Sher, on personal search
of the accused, his CNIC was recovered. The accused was
apprehended on the spot, whereafter, murasila was drafted and
sent to the police station through Constable Arif No.6 for
recording the FIR.

3. The learned counsel for the accused/petitioner
in support of bail petition contended, that the petitioner has
falsely been implicated, he is not a previous convict, lastly, he
submitted that while hearing a bail petition, the court is not to
keep in mind the maximum sentence provided by the law for
the charged offence, but, the one which is likely to be
imposed.

4. As against that, the learned counsel appearing
on behalf of the State, vehemently, ..- opposed’ the bail
application on the ground that huge quantity of charas has
been recovered from the toll box of the rickshaw in question,
driven by accused/petitioner, and that the offence falls within
the prohibition contained in section 497 Cr.P.C.

5. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties
and gone through the record.

6. The record reveals that the petitioner was found
in possession of 2200 grams charas. The contention of the
learned counsel for the petitioner that while hearing a petition
for the grant of bail, the court has not to keep in mind the

maximum sentence provided by law for charged offence, but

one which is likely to be imposed, is misconceived. The
offence with which the petitioner is charged is punishable
with death or life imprisonment or imprisonment for fourteen
years. The sentence mentioned in the referred case are to be
considered only when after trial the sentence is to be imposed
on a convict. Reliance can well be placed on case titled Secha
Gul _vs. The State (2015 SCMR-1077). The record reflects
that recovery of charas was made from the toll box of the
rickshaw in question, driven by the petitioner. It has been held
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
Nadir Khan vs. The State (1988 SCMR-1899) that a driver of
the vehicle is to be saddled with responsibility of conscious
possession of narcotic substance found in the vehicle being
driven by him. The report of the chemical examiner regarding
the samples of recovered substance has already been received
in the positive. After completion of investigation a challan has
been submitted on 10.4.2017, against the petitioner, offence
ws 9(c) CNS Act, 1997, is punishable with death or
imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term which may
extend to fourteen years and shall also be liable to fine, which
may be upto one million rupees and by virtue of provisions of
section 51 of CNS Act, 1997, there is prohibition against grant
of bail in such cases.

7. The learned counsel for the petitioner has failed

to bring on record any material, which may show any

ony

malafide or malice on the part of police for his false
involvement in the case in hand.

8. In view of what has been discussed above, the
petitioner is not entitled for bail. His bail application is,
therefore, dismissed. However, the prosecution is directed to
conclude the trial expeditiously within a period of four
months from the date of receipt of file from this Court. Order
accordingly. a
