JUDGMENT

SYED ARSHAD ALI, J. My this judgment is aimed to

dispose of this petition as well as the connected petition i.e.
Cr.M (QP) No.74-P/2020, as essentially in both the cases

adjudication of a common question of law are involved.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner Aqib Ali is
an accused in the case FIR No.107 dated 14.08.2019,
registered under Section 9-C of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
CNSA, 1997, for having in his possession amphetamine
weighing 4.975 KGs.

3. The accused Hayat Ullah is charged in the case FIR
No.120 dated 05.09.2019, under Sections 9-C/15 of the Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa CNSA, 1997, for having in his possession heroin

weighing 6 KGs.
4. In both the cases, the learned Trial Court has allowed the
application of the prosecution for collecting further samples
from the recovered contraband for chemical analysis. Needless
to mention that at the time of recovery of the contraband by
police, samples were collected from the said contraband and
were sent to the chemical examiner and the report whereof is
available on the file.

5, The learned counsels for the petitioners has argued that
the learned Trial Court had no jurisdiction to allow the
investigation for collecting further samples from the alleged
contraband for chemical analysis as it amounts to filling
lacuna in the prosecution case which is contrary to law. The
learned counsel has relied upon the law laid down in this
regard by the Apex Court in the case of “Muhammad Naeem
(PLD 2019 Supreme Court 669)” and “Qaiser Javed Khan
(PLD Supreme Court 57)”.

6. On the other hand, the learned Special Prosecutor on
behalf of the State has relied upon the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of “Hussain Shah (PLD 2020 Supreme
Court 132)”, wherein, the collection of re-sampling was
approved by the Apex Court.

7. Arguments heard and record of the case was perused.

8. Admittedly, in both the cases, investigation is complete
and the Trial Court has taken cognizance of the matter. Thus,
the essential issue before this Court whether learned Trial

Court had any jurisdiction to allow the
investigation/prosecution to collect further samples from
alleged recovered Narcotics for the report of chemical analysis.
In this regard, it is the argument of the learned prosecutor that
the said samples were collected prior to the judgment of the
Apex Court emphasizing upon observing the protocol while
examining the contraband by the expert. This argument has not
impressed this Court because in our judicial dispensation,
which is adversarial in its nature and character, the Court acts
as a neutral arbiter and has to dispassionately apprise,
appreciate, examine and weigh the evidence placed before it
rather than by ignoring the evidence and embarking on a
probing journey. “Muhammad Naeem case (PLD 2019
Supreme Court 669)”.

9. The case law referred by the learned prosecutor

(Hussain Shah’s case), in my humble view, is not applicable to

the present case. In the said case the police had recovered chars

weighing 12000 KG contained in 600 bags, each bag

containing 20 packets were recovered and samples of the

recovered substance were returned by the chemical examiner

and had required the investigation that the sample had to be

taken from each and every packet of the substance recovered.

Thus, in the said case there was no FSL report available and in

this background the Trial Court had allowed taking of sample
from all the parcels. Whereas, in the present case the samples

were already collected by the investigation officer/police

officer and it was sent to the report for chemical analysis

which is available on file. The issue of retaking samples has

been elaborately answered and deprecated by the Apex Court

in the latest judgment reported as “Qaiser Javed Khan Vs the

State (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 57)”, wherein, the Hon’ble

Apex Court has held that:-

“Once the above three requirements under
Rule 6 are contained in the Report of the
Government Analyst, any ambiguity
therein may be resolved by the Trial Court
by exercising its power under Proviso to
section 510, Cr.P.C. The said provision
states that the Court may, if it considers
necessary in the interest of justice, summon
and examine the person by whom such
report has been made. Therefore, the
Tribunal Court while examining the said
Report has the power to summon the
Government Analyst in case there is any
ambiguity in the said Report and seek
clarification thereof. This clarification can
only be based on the existing record of the
Government Analyst and does not mean to
allow the Government Analyst to conduct a
fresh_test or prepare another Report, for

that would _amount__to giving __ the
rosecution_a_chance_of filling the gaps

and lacunas in the Report. The Trial Court
must also be mindful of the legal position
that the per se admissibility of the Report
ie. without examining the Analyst (expert)
does not vouch for its evidentiary value, as
observed in Khair-ul-Bashar. The Courts
are free to examine the contents of the
Report and to assess its evidentiary value
(weight), a matter distinct from its
admissibility”. (Underline is for emphasis).

10. Thus, the impugned order of the Trial Court in both the

cases is contrary to the law laid down by the Apex Court in
(Qaiser Javed Khan’s) case supra, which is, thus, not

sustainable and is, accordingly, set aside. The learned Trial

Court shall proceed in the matter strictly in accordance with

law.

11. Thus, both the petitions are disposed of, in the above

terms.
