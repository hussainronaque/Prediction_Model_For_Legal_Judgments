Feeling aggrieved, the appellant has filed this Cr. Appeal
No. 20-D/2016.

2. The prosecution case as disclosed in the
FIR (murasila) Ex:PA are that on 28.11.2014 at 16:00
hours, the SHO Haroon Rashid, police station Yarik,

D.I.Khan alongwith police party made ‘nakabandi’ on
-2-

Mufti Mehmood Chowk at D.I.Khan, a coaster bearing
No.3999 coming from Peshawar side was stopped by the
police for checking, constable Sami Ullah Pw-4 and
official driver Din Muhammad PW-1, checked coaster
and found the appellant seated in the coaster and
recovered a black bag laying beneath his foot. On query,
he disclosed his name as Saeedullah Khan son of Gulab
Khan, and claimed ownership of the bag in question. He
was deboarded from the coaster, on search of his bag,
07-packets of opium and 04-packets of heroin wrapped
with solution tap were recovered. On weighing, each
packet opium contained 1200 grams opium and each
packet of heroin contained 100 grams heroin and on the
remaining 02-packets contained 500 grams heroin. The
contraband were took into possession vide recovery
memo Ex:Pw-4/1, out of the said quantity of opium and
heroin, 05 grams each were sealed into parcel and sent to
the chemical examiner for analysis and whose report
tendered as Ex:Pw-5/1 confirmed the contents to be that
of opium and heroin.

3. After completion of investigation, the
appellant was challan to face the trial, he was charged
under section 9 (c) CNSA, 1997, to which, he pleaded
not guilty and claimed trial.

4. The prosecution produced Din

Muhammad, Driver PW-1, Haroon Rashid, Inspector,
-3-

Ameer Taimoor PW-2, Head Constable PW-3, Sami
Ullah Constable, PW-4 and Abdul Latif PW-5 who
investigated the case. After closure of prosecution
evidence, the accused was examined under section 342
Cr.P.C, wherein he denied the allegations put forth by
the prosecution, but he neither wished to be examined on
oath under section 340 (2) Cr.P.C nor did adduce any
defence. On the conclusion of the trial, the appellant was
convicted and sentenced as stated above.

5. It is, inter alia, contended by the learned
counsel for the appellant that the appellant is innocent
and has falsely been implicated in the instant case; that
nothing incriminating articles were recovered from the
personal possession of the accused; that the case
property (contraband) was neither produced nor
exhibited by the prosecution, which is fatal to the
prosecution case; that the bag in question was recovered
by PW-1 and PW-4, but PW-1 is neither the witness of
the recovery memo nor attested the same; that the
prosecution has failed to prove the recovery of alleged
contraband from the possession of the accused beyond a
ray of doubt, therefore, the conviction and sentence
recorded by the learned trial court is not sustainable in
the eye of law; that neither the driver nor the conductor
of the coaster in question were examined to show that

the accused was travelling in the coaster in question.
-4-

6. Conversely, the learned Additional
Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State
argued that the appellant was found seated in the coaster
in question and he himself claimed ownership of the bag
and in its presence recovery of contraband was made
from the bag laying beneath his foot; that police has got
no ill-will or enmity to implicate him in a false case; that
samples of contraband were sent to the FSL and its
report was received in positive; that the prosecution has
proved its case against the appellant beyond a shadow of
doubt, therefore, he was rightly convicted and sentenced
and lastly prayed for dismissal of the appeal.

7. We have heard the arguments of the
learned counsel for the parties and have perused the
record with the able assistance of the learned counsel for
the parties.

8. Perusal of the record reflects that the
prosecution case rested upon the recovery of opium and
heroin from the bag laying beneath foot of the
appellant/accused who was seated in the coaster bearing
No. 3999-LES, affirmative report of FSL Ex.Pw-5/1,
statement of Pw-1, PW-2, PW-4 and PW-5S.

9. We find that as per allegations disclosed in
the murasila the 07-packets of opium wrapped in
solution tap each packet contained 1200 grams, 02-

packets heroin each contained 100 grams, 02-packets
-5-

each contained 500 grams were recovered from the bag
allegedly laying beneath the foot of the appellant who
were seated in the coaster, but nothing was mentioned in
the murasila Ex.Pw2/1 to show that sample of 05, 05
grams of opium and heroin were separated for the
purpose of chemical examiner analysis, therefore, it
cannot be said that the samples which were sent to the
chemical examiner for analysis were the sample of this
case or some other case, therefore, genuineness of this
report in these circumstances is not free from doubt and
it is not safe to rely upon the same.

10. The marginal witnesses of the recovery
memo Ex.PW-4/1, whereby the contraband in question
were taken into possession were examined as PW-2 &
Pw-4. They did not utter even a single word about
separation of the samples from the recovery of
contraband for the purpose of chemical examiner
analysis though the same is mentioned in the recovery
memo. It was alleged in the initial report recorded in
shape of murasila Ex:Pw-2/1 that the coaster was
checked by official driver Din Muhammad and constable
Sami Ullah and the date of recovery of report as given in
the FIR is 28.11.2014, however, when the said Din
Muhammad was examined as PW-1, he stated that he
was present with the SHO on Nakabandi at Mufti

Mehmood Chowk, Bypass road, D.I-Khan_ on
-6-

29.11.2014 which date is one day after the recovery.
PW-1 & PW-4 stated in their examination-in-chief that
the bag in question was laying beneath the leg of the
appellant while PW-2 Haroon Rashid, SHO stated that
the accused was seated in the coaster and beneath his
seat a black color bag was laying and did not say even a
single word that the accused claimed its ownership and
the same is position in the statement of PW-1 & Pw-4.
11. The case property i.e recovered narcotics
were neither exhibited nor produced before the trial
court, which is the best evidence of the prosecution
against the appellant. The non-production of the case
property in the court is fatal to the prosecution case and
destroyed its very foundation. In this respect, reliance

can be placed on the case titled Abrar Hussain V. The

State (2017 P.Cr.L.J 14) Lahore wherein it was held as

under:-
S.9(c)..... Possession, import or
export, or financing of trafficking
of narcotics..... Appreciation of
evidence..... Non-production of
case property before
court.......effect ....... Material

contradictions existed in the
evidence available on the
record..... Case property had not
been produced by the police before
the trial court without any
justification, which showed _ that
the police had malice towards the
accused regarding recovery of the
contraband.... Production of the
case property before the court was
the primary duty of the police in
order to bring home the guilt of the
-7-

accused....Non-production of the
case property was fatal to the
prosecution’s case, and the same
had destroyed the very foundation
of the case.

In this respect reliance may also be made

from the judgment of this Court reported as Muhammad

Fiaz V. The State (2017 PLD 74) Peshawar.

12. For what has been discussed above, we
hold that the prosecution has miserably failed to
establish its case against the appellant beyond a ray of
doubt, therefore, this appeal is accepted and_ the
conviction and sentenced recorded under section 9(c)
CNSA, 1997 is set aside and the appellant/accused is
acquitted of the charges. The accused is in Jail, he is

directed to be released forthwith if not required in any

other case.
