2. The brief and essential facts leading
to institution of instant revision petition are that
petitioners Zahid Zaman Khan etc filed suit
No.167/1 of 2007 against the respondents
secking declaration and permanent injunction etc
in respect of property comprising in ‘Khasra’
Nos.586 and 587 measuring 13 ‘Marlas’ situated
in ‘Mauza’ Dhamtaur, Tehsil and District
Abbottabad and similarly, respondent No.1, Khan
Afsar, also filed suit No.166/1 of 2007 for
declaration and possession etc regarding the
same property, referred to above. Both the
parties appeared before the learned trial Court
and filed their written statements in_ their
respective suits. The learned trial Court
consolidated both the suits and out of the
pleadings of the parties framed as many as eleven
consolidated issues and both the parties were
allowed to produce their evidence in support of
their respective issues. After recording evidence,
the learned trial Court, while hearing arguments
of learned counsel for the parties on the

application of present petitioners Zahid Zaman
3

ctc for appointment of local commission, with the
consensus of both the parties also framed an
additional issue and also produced evidence in
respect of the said additional issue. The learned
trial Court, after hearing arguments of learned
counsel for the parties, dismissed suit No.167/1
of 2007 filed by the petitioners, while decreed the
connected suit No.166/1 of 2007 filed by
respondent No.1 vide its judgment and decree
dated 31.01.2012. The said judgment and decree
was impugned by both the parties in their
separate appeals before the learned District
Judge, Abbottabad. During pendency of said
appeals, the present petitioners Zahid Zaman etc
requested for remanding of the case to the
learned trial Court for framing of additional issue
and providing opportunity to the parties to
produce evidence in support of said additional
issue. However, the learned Appellate Court vide
impugned order dated 22.05.2018 declined the
request of the petitioners. Hence, the present

revision petition.

3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf
of respondent No.1, at the very outset of the
proceedings, has challenged the maintainability
of the present revision petition on the ground
that the same is not competent, as the appeal has
not yet been finally decided by the learned
Appeal Court, therefore, the present revision
petition under section 115 CPC is not competent
against the said order, as the impugned order of
the learned Appeal Court does not fall within the
ambit of ‘Case Decided’.

4. Learned counsel for the petitioners,
on the other hand, while controverting the
arguments of learned counsel for the respondent,
argued that the present revision petition is
maintainable because the learned Appellate
Court has finally decided point of law regarding
framing of issues as per pleadings of the parties
and contended that the impugned order squarely
falls within the ambit of provisions of section 115
G.P.C.

5. Arguments of the learned counsel for

the parties heard and the available record of the
5

case thoroughly gone through with their able
assistance.

6. The controversy involved in the
matter in hand pertains to the refusal of the
learned Appeal Court to remand the case for
framing of additional issue and_ providing
opportunity for recording evidence of the parties
in support thereof. However, the question arises,
whether the impugned order has the attribute of
the ‘case decided’, which is the ‘sine-qua-non’ for
assuming the jurisdiction under section 115
C.P.C. For the Sake of convenience, provisions of
115 CPC are reproduced below:-

“115.Revision..-(1 )The High Court may
call for the record of any case which has
been decided by any Court subordinate
to such High Court and in which no
appeal lies thereto, and if such
subordinate Court appears

ve It is very much manifest from the very
provision of section 115 CPC that the jurisdiction
of the Court is only provided in a situation where

the ‘case’ has been ‘decided’ by a subordinate
6
Court to such High Court. In the instant case, the
learned District Judge, through the impugned
order, has declined the verbal request of
petitioners for remanding of case back to the
learned trial Court for framing of additional issue
in the case and it has not decided the appeal,
which is still pending before it. It is to worth
mentioning that Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has
provided a mechanism for impugning/challenging
interlocutory orders passed by the trial Court and
in this respect section 104 and Order XLII] CPC
has specifically mentioned all those orders, which
are appealable. However, the orders, which do not
fall within the ambit of the provisions of section
104 and Order-XLII] CPC could be impugned in a
revision petition. So far as the interlocutory
orders of the Appeal Court are concerned, no such
mechanism and distinction has been provided by
section 96 read with Order XLI of the C.P.C. Thus,
in view of above it is held that interlocutory
orders of Appeal Court which do not finally decide
the appeal or a contesting issue during the

pendency of appeal having the attribute of a final
7
order, are not challengeable in revision petition
under section 115 CPC. In this regard, this Court
would like to refer to the judgment passed in case

titled ‘Mian Muhammad Luqman and 5 others v.

Farida Khanam and another (1994 SCMR 1991)

wherein, it has specifically been observed as
under:

“It is not denied by the respondents’
learned counsel that unless it is “a
case decided” the Iigh Court has no
jurisdiction under section 115,
C.P.C. to deal with the matter on
civil Revisional side. On the specific
point; where, the order passed in
this case by the trial court which
was impugned before the Iligh
Court did constitute a “case
decided” the learned counsel,
although having remained for
considerable time hesitant to admit
that it did not constitute “a case
decided” ultimately failed to satisfy
the Court that it did constitute “a
case decided.”

The same principle has been
reiterated in the judgment reported
as Nestle Milkpak Limited v. Classic
Needs Pakistan (Pvt.)Ltd. And 3
others (2006 SCMR 21).”

Moreover, in support of abovementioned legal
point, reference may be made to Nawabzada

Malik Habibullah_Khan’s case (1969 SCMR

965), ‘Messrs PAK ASIA_CNG-2, Filing Station

through Ahmad Dawood _ Sole Proprietor _V.

SNGP_ Lines through Managing Director and 3

8

others’ (2012 YLR 1241), ‘Haji Ghulam

Muhammad v. Haji Anwar Jan and 3 others’

(2012 YLR 2670), ‘Haji_Baz Muhammad _and

another v. Mst. Humera alias Shireen Taj and 3

others’ (PLD 2003 Quetta 128) and ‘Abdul

Razzaq and others Vs. Muhammad Ajmal Khan’

(PLD 2018 Lahore 491),

Thus, in view of above, the present revision

petition is not maintainable under section 115
C.P.C.
8. Even otherwise, the case of the
petitioners on merits is also not worth
consideration because the record reveals that on
05.01.2012, learned trial Court during the course
of arguments on application for appointment of
local commission and application for re-
examination of DW-3 Arif Khan, with concurrence
of both the parties had framed the following
additional issue:

“What is the market value of the
suit property, including
improvements, constructions and
shops constructed over the

disputed property for the purpose
9

of suit valuation and court fees?”

After framing of abovementioned additional issuc,
plaintiffs were directed to record their additional
evidence on 09.01.2012, which was accordingly
recorded in shape of AW-1 to AW-8 and they
closed their evidence, subsequently, — the
respondent/defendant recorded his evidence and
also closed his evidence and the cases were
decided by the learned trial Court through a
consolidated judgment dated 31.01.2012.

Granted, that it is the duty of the
Court under Order XIV of CPC to frame issues
arising out of the pleadings of the parties,
however, it is also settled that the parties are
under an obligation to go through the issues so
framed _and_if they notice any shortcoming/
deficiency, it should be pointed out to the Court at

the very outset. In ‘EADA KHAN v Mst. GHANWAR

and others’ (2004 SCMR 1524), the Hon’ble Apex

Court has held that:

“It is settled principle of law that
if once the parties are alive to the
contentions raised and when
once evidence is adduced in
support of such contentions, the
10

framing or non-framing of issues
loses significance.”

The same view has been adopted by the august

Apex Court in case titled ‘AMJAD KHAN vy. MST.

ASIYA KAUSAR and 2 others’ (2015 SCMR 1)

Reliance in this respect is also placed on

‘MUHAMMAD YASIN through L.Rs and others v.

Additional District Judge and 2 others’ (2016

YLR Note 203). Therefore, the subsequent verbal
request of the petitioners for framing of additional
issue and recording of evidence at such a belated
stage before the Appellate Court was not justified
and tenable in view of settled principles of law
referred to above.

9. Keeping in view the above facts and
circumstances of present case and discussion
made thereupon, the present revision petition is
dismissed both on maintainability as well as on
merits.

Dt.08.10.2018.
