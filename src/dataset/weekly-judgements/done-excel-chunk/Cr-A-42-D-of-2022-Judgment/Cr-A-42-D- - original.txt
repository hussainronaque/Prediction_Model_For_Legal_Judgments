2. The prosecution story as disclosed in the
FIR, in brief, is that on 11.4.2004, complainant Abdus
Salam Khan, with the help of co-villages, brought the
dead body of his brother Hizb Ullah to Police Station
Kulachi, where he reported the matter to the local
police that on the eventful day, he alongwith his afore-
named brother had gone to the house of his nephew
(sister’s son), namely Aftab Khan, wherefrom they
were returning to their home; that his brother was
ahead of him while he was following him at some
distance and at the relevant time, when they reached
near the medical store of Gulli Doctor, the accused
Naimat Ullah, duly armed with Kalashnikov emerged
on the scene of occurrence and called his brother that
he would not be spared and started firing at him, as a
result whereof, his brother got hit and fell to the
ground. After commission of the occurrence, the
accused fled away from the spot. When the
complainant attended his brother, he had already
breathed his last. The occurrence was stated to be
witnessed by the complainant. Motive for the
occurrence was stated to be that the accused was
teasing and harassing his nephew, who was restrained
by the deceased, whereupon the accused was annoyed.
He charged the accused for the commission of

offence.

3. On completion of the investigation,
complete challan against the accused was submitted
before the learned trial Court where at the
commencement of trial, the prosecution produced and
examined as many as nine (9) witnesses, whereafter,
statement of the accused under section 342 Cr.P.C,
was recorded wherein he professed innocence and
false implication, however, neither he wished to be
examined under section 340(2) Cr.P.C, nor produced
defence evidence. It is pertinent to mention here that
on 27.01.2021, APP submitted an application before
the trial Court for transposition of the statements of
Ghulam Shabbir SHO, Muhammad Jan S.I and Dr.
Shah Noor, recorded during proceedings u/s 512,
Cr.P.C., on the ground that the witnesses were dead.
The application was allowed vide order dated
26.10.2021 and pursuant thereto, statements of afore-
named witnesses were transposed to the present trial.
On conclusion of trial and after hearing arguments, the
learned trial, convicted the appellant and sentenced
him, as mentioned above, which has been assailed by
the appellant through the instant criminal appeal,
whereas the complainant has filed connected criminal
revision for enhancement of sentence. Both the
criminal appeal and criminal revision are being

decided through this common judgment.

she

4, We have heard the learned counsel
representing the appellant, the learned A.A.G. assisted
by learned private counsel at length and with their
valuable assistance, the record was gone through.

5. Though the learned trial Court passed a
guilty verdict, yet this being the appellate Court is
under the bounden duty to assess and re-assess the
available evidence on the file and to appreciate as to
whether the learned trial Court was correct in its
approach by convicting the appellant. True, that in
case of single accused, substitution is a rare
phenomenon, but equally true that to charge a single
accused will not absolve the prosecution of its liability
to prove the case through trustworthy and confidence
inspiring evidence. In order to ascertain as to whether
the impugned judgment is based on proper reasoning
and that the learned trial Court correctly applied its
judicial mind to the facts and circumstances of the
case keeping in view the evidence available on the
file, so we deem it essential to thrash out the evidence
so as to avoid miscarriage of justice.

6. It was on 11.4.2004, when the complainant
alongwith his deceased brother were coming back
from the house of their nephew Aftab Khan, situated
in Mohallah Shakhi, Kulachi, towards their house
situated in Mohallah Ranazai and when they reached

opposite medical store of one Gulli Doctor at Shakhi
-5-

Gate, his deceased brother was walking ahead of him,
meanwhile, accused duly armed with a Kalashnikov
emerged on the spot and started firing at him, who
was hit and died on the spot. This Court is conscious
that in criminal dispensation of justice, direct evidence
plays a pivotal role and no other evidence can be a
substitute to the direct evidence. There can be no
denial of the fact that conviction can be based upon
the testimony of a related witness when it is found that
the same rings true and natural. On the contrary,
statement of related witness is to be scrutinized with
great care and caution and that too, when an accused
is charged in a murder case. In the present case, the
ocular account of the incident has been furnished by
the complainant (brother of the deceased), who was
examined before the trial Court as PW-5, therefore, in
order to reach at a just conclusion, at first instance we
would like to discuss his testimony. The complainant,
in his Court statement, while narrating the story as
mentioned in the FIR, added/improved that after
taking few steps, his brother fell down and succumbed
to his injuries and that he recognized him in the light
of bulb installed at front of Kashmir Bakers. It is in
the statement of the complainant that at the time of
incident, his deceased brother was walking at some
paces ahead of him, when the accused armed with

Kalashnikov came in front of them from the opposite

-6-

side, made Lalkara at his brother and started firing.
This deposition of the complainant cannot be believed
for two reasons, firstly, that the same is belied by the
first information report where it has been narrated that
afier receiving fire shots the deceased fell to the
ground and died on the spot; secondly, even if, for the
sake of argument, it is accepted that the accused
emerged from front side of the deceased, then
according to site plan the complainant would be in the
line of firing, however, the site plan speaks otherwise
ic. point No.2 ascribed to the accused is towards
north east side of the deceased and complainant,
whereas points No.1 and 3, assigned to the deceased
and complainant are towards south and western side
of the accused, respectively. The complainant further
stated that after lodging the report, the dead body of
his brother was shifted to hospital while he
accompanied the Investigating Officer to the spot
where he pointed out the place of occurrence to the
Investigating Officer, who prepared site plan in the
light of bulb as well as in the headlights of official
vehicle, which is belied by the statement of
Kifayatullah SI (PW-4), who stated during cross
examination that, “We conducted all the proceedings
on the spot with the help of headlight of official
vehicle as it was pitch dark”. It is also not appealable

to a prudent mind that a brother would prefer to go to

~

“J.

the spot and would not escort the dead body of his
brother.

The moot point for determination is the
joint visit of the house to their nephew (sister’s son)
by two brothers i.e. the complainant and the deceased.
In this regard, the complainant was specifically cross-
examined to which he replied that “we both the
brothers by chance went to the house of my sister”,
meaning thereby that he was a chance witness,
however, he never disclosed the purpose of his visit to
his sister’s house. Even none from the family
member of his sister’s house was cited as a witness
in order to establish the purpose for the joint visit of
the two brothers.

7. A chance witness, in legal parlance is the
one who claims that he was present on the crime
spot at the fateful time, albeit, his presence there
was by a sheer chance as in the ordinary course of
business, place of residence and normal course of
events, he was not supposed to be present on the
spot but at a place where he resides, carries on
business or runs day to day life affairs. It is in this
context that the testimony of chance witness,
ordinarily, is not accepted unless justifiable reasons
are shown to establish his presence at the crime

scene at the relevant time. In normal course, the

-8-

presumption under the law would operate about his
absence from the crime spot. True, that in rare cases,
the testimony of chance witness may be relied upon,
provided some convincing explanations appealing to
prudent mind for his presence on the crime spot are
put forth, when the occurrence took place otherwise,
his testimony would fall within the category of
suspect evidence and cannot be accepted without a
pinch of salt. In case titled ‘Liaquat Hussain_and
others Vs. Falak Sher and others (2003 SCMR 611),
it was held by the apex Court that “Zye-witnesses
including the complainant had failed to furnish a
plausible and acceptable explanation for being
present on the scene of occurrence and were chance
witnesses---Prosecution case did not inspire
confidence and fell for short of sounding probable to a
man of reasonable prudence”. No cogent, convincing
and believable explanation, justifying the presence of
complainant on the spot at the time of incident is
forthcoming from the evidence on record, therefore, it
was sufficient to discard his testimony. In this respect,

reliance can be placed on the cases of Mst, Rukhsana
Begum _and_ others Vs. Sajjad _and_ others (2017

SCMR 596), Mst. Anwar Begum Vs. Akhtar Hussain
alias Kaka and 2 others (2017 SCMR 1710) and Mst.

-9-

Sughra Begum Vs. Qaiser Pervez and others (2015
SCMR 1142),

The complainant was not even aware of the
distance/rough distance between the place of
occurrence and the house of his sister. According to
the complainant, the occurrence took place at western
side of the Shakhi Gate, which is thickly populated
area, surrounded by shops etc and people always
remain there. He admitted that at the time of incident
two shops were open. It is worth mentioning that the
shop i.e. Kashmir Bakers relating to Gulli Doctor was
opened at the time of incident, however, said Gulli
Doctor has not been cited as witness. In this view of
the matter, best available evidence was withheld for
reasons best known to the prosecution, therefore, an
adverse inference under Article 129(g) of Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984, could be formed that had he
been cited as a witness, he would not have supported
the stance of the complainant/prosecution.
Furthermore, the complainant admitted that the word
‘in front of us’ is not available in the FIR, nor in his
supplementary statement. While contradicting his own
statement, he admitted that the deceased fell down on
the ground where he was standing. Factum of bulb is
neither mentioned in the FIR, nor in examination-in-
chief of the complainant nor in his supplementary

statement. Further cross-examination of the

D

-10«

complainant is more astonishing when he was
confronted with his supplementary statement,
especially with regard to shifting of the dead body to
the hospital. He stated that Ashraf and Zahoor Khan
accompanied them in shifling the dead body to the
hospital. According to him, both the afore-named
persons alongwith others were attracted to the spot
after hearing the firing and soon after that they shifted
the dead body to the Police Station. The above
deposition, in our opinion, is sufficient to discard
testimony of the complainant for the reason that the
same runs counter to the FIR. Even otherwise, none of
the afore-named persons was examined before the trial
Court to support the above deposition of the
complainant. It is pertinent to mention here that
according to transposed statement of Dr. Shah Noor
(PW-9), the afore-named Ashraf and Zahoor Khan
had identified the dead body before him, however,
since they were not examined before the trial Court,
therefore, it cannot be ascertained that who shifted the
dead body from Police Station to the hospital. Even
time of shifting of the dead body remained a mystery
as yet, as no evidence is available on file in this
respect. The learned trial Court while convicting the
appellant has totally ignored the above glaring
discrepancies surfacing in the prosecution case,

especially in the statement of complainant, which
-li-

were otherwise sufficient to establish that the
complainant was not present on the spot at the time of
incident.

In case reported as “Irfan Ali Vs, the
State” (2015 SCMR 846), it was held by the Apex
Court that:-

“To award a capital punishment in a
murder crime, it is imperative for the
prosecution to lead unimpeachable
evidence of a first degree, which
ordinarily must — get strong
corroboration Srom other
independent evidence if the witnesses
are interested or inimical towards the
accused. In a criminal trial no
presumption can be drawn against
the accused person as it is a cardinal
principle of justice that no one
Should be construed into a crime
without legal _—prooffevidence,
sufficient to be acted upon. No care
and caution was observed in the
present case in light of this principle.
No evidence of believable nature was
led with regard to the motive in the
case to lend support to the
prosecution version”.

8. In addition to the above, Kifayatullah SI
was examined before the trial Court as PW-4. While
contradicting the complainant, he stated in his cross-
examination that Sham Qaza Vela, he alongwith
Investigating Officer reach on the spot and at that
moment no private person was present; that they
performed evening prayer on the spot, site plan was
prepared by the 1.0 in the headlights of vehicle. He
further contradicted the complainant by stating that

they proceeded from Police Station before evening

12

prayer. He also contradicted the complainant by
stating that the Investigating Officer had not
summoned any private person to the spot, however, at
that moment complainant was also not present and
that at the time of spot inspection, no private person
was examined by the I.O and only his statement was
recorded on the spot. The above deposition of PW-4
clearly negates the version of the complainant, which
is sufficient to establish that neither the complainant
was present on the spot at the time of incident, nor he
had accompanied the Investigating Officer from
Police Station to the spot.

9: So far as recovery of seven empties of 7.62
bore, two spent bullets stuck into the wall opposite to
the shop and a 60 watt bulb from shop of Kashmir
Bakers coupled with the medical evidence, are
concerned, suffice it to say that the same being
corroborative evidence cannot overweigh the direct
evidence which has already been disbelieved by us in
the preceding paragraphs. In this behalf, reliance can
be placed on the cases reported as “Dr. Israr-ul-Hag
Vs. Muhammad Fayyaz and another” (2007 SCMR
1427), “Muhammad Janiil Vs. Muhammad Akram
and others” (2009 SCMR_ 120), “Abid Ali and 2
others Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR_ 208),

“Muhammad Nawaz and others Vs. The State and

others” (2016 SCMR 267) and “Tariq Zaman Vs.

-13-

Muhammad Shafi Khan and 2 others” (2018 MLD
Peshawar 854).

10. The prosecution alleged motive to be that
the accused was teasing and harassing nephew
(sister’s son) of the complainant, who was restrained
by the deceased, which annoyed the convict/appellant,
however, the prosecution did not succeed in
establishing the alleged motive and even no
independent witness was produced in that respect. The
prosecution, in all circumstances was to prove the
same. When the prosecution did not succeed in
establishing the motive, then it is for the prosecution
to suffer, as is held in case reported as "Hakim Ali Vs.
The State" (1971 SCMR-432), that the prosecution
though not called upon to establish motive in every
case, yet once it has setup a motive and failed to
establish, the prosecution must suffer consequences
and not the defence. The above view has been

reiterated in the case of "Amin Ullah Vs. The State"

(PLD 1976 SC 629), wherein, it has been observed by
their lordships, that motive is an important constituent
and if found by the Court to be untrue, the Court
should be on guard to accept the prosecution story. It
was again re-enforced by the august Supreme Court in

the case of “Muhammad Sadiq Vs. Muhammad
Sarwar? (1997 SCMR_ 214). Again, on the same

principle, case laws titled “Noor Muhammad Vs.
-14-

The State and another” (2010 SCMR_997)_and
“Amin Ali and another Vs. The State” 2011 SCMR-
323) can also be referred.

11. It was highly agitated, that right from the
day of incident till his arrest, the appellant remained in
hiding with no plausible explanation. It was submitted
that the long unexplained abscondence alone was
sufficient to convict the appellant. There is no cavil
with the proposition that abscondence is not a
substantive piece of evidence, rather it is a
circumstance that can be taken into consideration, that
too, when the prosecution succeeds in bringing home
guilt against the accused by producing convincing
evidence, but in the instant case the situation is
altogether different, therefore, abscondence alone
cannot be taken into consideration to convict the
appellant, that too, for awarding capital punishment.
12. The learned trial Court has not appreciated
the evidence in its true perspective and thereby fell in
error by convicting the appellant. We have minutely
perused the judgment under challenge through all
angles, which cannot face the test of judicious scrutiny
and the same invites attention of this Court for
interference.

13. Accumulative effect of the whole aspects
taken into consideration, leads us to only conclusion

that the prosecution has miserably failed to establish

-15-

the case against the appellant, otherwise to extend
benefit of doubt so many circumstances are not
required to be brought forth. The instant criminal
appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside,
resultantly, the appellant is acquitted of the charges
levelled against him. He shall be released forthwith, if
not required to be detained in connection with any
other case. Since we have set aside the conviction and
sentence awarded to the appellant, therefore, the
connected criminal revision for enhancement of
sentence has become infructuous which stands
dismissed accordingly.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of our short

if,

order of even date.
