Emergency Ward, who had brought the injured
Nazmeen Khan alias Nazoo, another person by

he alongwith his brothers Nazmeen Khan, Laiq
Zada, Nisar Muhammad and Jehan Sher Khan
were on their way through NCP motorcar
bearing No. 610-PSSS having some private and
domestic engagements. They were approaching
toward Sawarai when at about 10.15 hours from
the nearby street known as Sahibullah forthwith
appeared, accused Ibrahim and his sons Salih
Islam, Tariq Islam, Zahoor-ul-Islam and Zia-ul-
Islam alias Menai and Mohsin Islam all armed
with their respective pistols and Kalashnikovs,
on seeing them, all these persons started firing
at them. The fire shots of Tariq Islam hit his
brother who has received serious injuries. The
fire shots of Ibrahim the father of all the
accused/persons hit the complainant on his head

and was in an injured condition. One of the
Nawab

passerby was also hit on his head who later on
succumbed to the injuries. All other named
persons as referred to above however escaped
un-hurt. The deceased was taken to the hospital
Shanai while all other injured were brought to
Dagger hospital for the purpose of their
treatment. This occurrence is stated to be
witnessed by Gul Nawaz Khan and may be
someone else has also seen. The reason set as
motive, the previous case registered under
section 506 PPC which is still under trial before

the competent Court.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the accused/Petitioners, learned
counsel for the complainant and learned A.A.G
for the State, record with their assistance gone

through.

5. Learned counsel for the Petitioners

relied on PLJ 2014 Cr.C.(Lahore) 1 (Multan

Bench) "Asif Shezad vs the State and

another", 1995 MLD 1755 _" Muhammad

Mushtaq _vs_ the State", 2003 YLR_ 1378

State", 1996 SCMR 1654 "Muhammad Sadiq
and_ another vs the State", 2012 YLR_ 1728
(@eshawar) "Arshad _vs_the State and
another". In the light of these dictums of the
Hon'ble superior Courts prayed for the grant of
bail as almost all the family members of the
accused-party have been roped in the fact of
involvement of accused/Petitioners. It would be

determined during trial that whose fatal shots
Nawab

proved effective in respect of murder of the
deceased, so, this element makes the case of
Petitioners arguable for the purpose of bail.
Inversely, learned counsel for the complainant
duly assisted by learned A.A.G appearing on
behalf of the State referred to 1981 SCMR 1092
" Munawar vs the State", 2015 P Cr. LJ 402
(@eshawar) " Kamran_yvs_ Haji Muhammad
Zahir Khan and another", 2012 PCr. L J 690
(Sindh) " Kadir Bux alias Porho vs the State"

2017_P Cr. L_ J 21 (Islamabad) "Ameer
Hamza vs the State and others", 2004 SCMR
1068 " Shaukat Ali alias Shoka vs the State",
2004 P Cr.LJ 849 " Rangbaz vs the State and
another", 2016 P Cr. LJ 1781 (Peshawar

1995 PCr. LJ_ 1663 (Lahore) " Muhammad

LJ 1635 (Lahore) ""Muhammad Anwar ys the
State" and 2014 P Cr. LJ 1526 (Peshawar) "

Bazir_vs_the State". They both vehemently
opposed the grant of bail mainly on the ground

that the accused-party including the
Nawab

accused/Petitioners have shared common
intention within the meaning of vicarious
liability and their common act was so severe to
the effect that even passerby was not spared and
done to death in brutal manner, so, by all counts

they are not entitled to the concession of bail.

6. The purpose of bail is to grant
liberty to an accused involved in a case if there
are reasons to believe even if the offence falls
within the purview of prohibitory clause but if
there are reasons that there is further scope of
inquiry into guilt of each accused for reasons to
be recorded each accused be enlarged on bail
subject to furnishing of bail bonds for the sum
to be announced by the Court which shall
follow release of each accused. That is what
happened in the case FIR No. 473 dated
05.9.2012 registered under sections 506/34 PPC
at Police Station Dagger. In this case present
accused Ibrahim, Tariq Islam, Salih Islam and
Mohsin Islam amongst these names included

the accused/Petitioners who had been granted
Nawab

bail for the sum of Rs. 50,000/- during the

subsistence of the trial.

7. After implication in the present case
they absconded during the trial before the
learned Senior Civil Judge/ Judicial Magistrate
Buner and by the order dated 27.3.2013 their
sureties were penalized to the extent of 1/5
share which came out to Rs. 10,000/- for each
surety and on realization of forfeiture of bonds
coupled with proper notice within the meaning
of section 514 Cr.P.C since then these
accused/Petitioners have been declared
proclaimed offenders. Once a trust is ignored
and later after being implicated in a case which
invites punishment falling within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 (1) Cr.P.C
even if the Petitioners have been given the role
of vicarious liability with the charge of
ineffective firing attributing no overt act on
their part even then it would be difficult
situation for the accused/Petitioners to be
trusted for the grant of bail. The referred

authorities by the learned counsel for the
Nawab

complainant would have more force for refusal
of the bail on various counts of vicarious
liability and sharing of common intention. The
incident was stated to be a daylight occurrence
and the previous enmity in between the parties
was said to be proceedings under trial. The
accused/Petitioners appeared to have acted in
pre-concert and shared commonality of
intention with the co-accused. When these
sons, brother and father such like accused who
remained in absconsion and later have been
declared proclaimed offenders, obviously their
absconsion in a way would be hurdle in their
release on bail, especially when conduct of the
accused amounted to misuse of the concession
of bail. Therefore in view of all such prevailing
circumstances when accused-Petitioners have no
evidence in their defence that their father Ibrahim
who has already been refused bail by the
Courts, at all disentitle these Petitioners for such

concession.

8. Above all, these accused/Petitioners

remained absconder for considerable long period
Nawab

of more than 3 years, in which respect too, they
failed to furnish any plausible explanation that
as to why they remained fugitive from law for
such long period of time, especially when the
proceedings of the ibid criminal case
registered against them was pending between
the parties. So, their willful disappearance
soon after the occurrence prima facie
connected them with the commission of
offence falling within the prohibitory clause of
section 497 (1) Cr.P.C. As far as the arguments
of learned counsel for the Petitioners that bail
to an accused could not be refused on the sole
ground of abscondence is concerned, suffice it
to say, that when version of prosecution prima
facie lends support from other collected
material it could be declined as an exception.

9. Needless to mention that the
observations made above are purely tentative
in nature and should in no way prejudice the

case of either party during trial
10
10. In view of the above, this petition

for the grant of bail stands dismissed.
