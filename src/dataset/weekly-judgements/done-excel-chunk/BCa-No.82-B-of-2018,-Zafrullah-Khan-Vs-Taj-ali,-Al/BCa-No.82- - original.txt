According to contents of FIR allegedly the

Amd of Thasnaullah (brother of complainant), while Haji

Mirzali Khan and accused/ respondent Taj Ali Khan have

been charged for making firing at the complainant and his

brother Faridullah with intent to commit their qatl-e-Amd

with their respective weapons, resultantly, his brother

Faridullah got injured, while complainant luckily escaped

unhurt, hence, they were booked in case FIR ibid.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties

heard and record perused.

4. Grant of pre-arrest bail is an extra ordinary

remedy and is limited to exceptional and rare cases, that are

based on malafide, ulterior motive or where no offence is

shown to have been committed on the bare reading of the

FIR. Though it is yet to be proved but if any malafide or

ulterior motive to falsely involve the accused/ respondent

was apparent, he would have earlier surrendered before the

court, but he opted not to surrender before the court of law

and has been arrested after abscondence of more than three

years, without any reasonable explanation, despite the fact

that his co-accused are facing trial since long.

5. Plethora of case law could be cited for and

against the grant and cancellation of bail, but the conclusion

drawn is that logic of words has to be yield to the logic of

realities. Pre-arrest bail is to be granted only in extraordinary

situations to protect innocent persons against victimization

through abuse of law for ulterior motives. Bail before arrest

cannot be granted unless the person seeking it satisfies the

conditions specified through subsection (2) of section 497

Cr.PC, in other words he is required to establish the existence

of reasonable grounds leading to a belief that he was not

guilty of the offence alleged against him and there were in

fact sufficient grounds warranting further inquiry into his

guilt. In the instant case, the accused/ respondent is directly,

by name, charged showing his presence at the spot duly

armed with repeater and as a result of his firing with co-

accused , Fidaullah brother of complainant sustained injuries,

while complainant escaped unhurt. Medical report of the

injured Fidaullah reveals that he received 1/3" size entry

wound on his front thigh, while firearm multiple pellet

injuries on the left arm, hence, the size and nature of injuries

*4Azam Khan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.

support the crime weapon attributed to him. Perusal of site

plan and recovery memo reveals that from the place of

presence of accused/ respondent the investigation officer

recovered three crime empties of 12 bore, which prima facie

connect the accused/ respondent with the commission of

offence.

6. FIR is lodged with promptitude and specific role

is attributed which excludes the possibility of substitution.

No doubt that bail cancellation is a harsh order and right of

liberty is curtailed but on the contrary equal treatment before

law has more significance. A robust interpretation of facts

and law requires that justice should not only be done but

should be seen to have been done. Apart from that

investigation in the instant case is complete and trial has

commenced, sufficient evidence has already been recorded,

hence, this court could not go deep into merits of the case,

lest it may prejudice the case of any party. The learned lower

court has travelled beyond its jurisdiction and the parameters

set by the superior Courts from time to time for grant or

refusal of bail, in case of capital punishment. The impugned

*4Azam Khan/P.S* (S.B) Mr. Justice Muhammad Nasir Mahfooz.

order is not only arbitrary and erroneous but is also in
violation of principle of justice, which if allowed to remain in
field then each and every case will be of further inquiry and
accused would be entitled to pre-arrest bail.
7. For the reasons discussed above, this petition is
allowed, impugned order of learned lower Court is recalled and
bail of respondent is cancelled. As a consequence whereof, he is
taken into custody and be sent to judicial lockup being under
trial prisoner. However, the learned trial Court is directed to
conclude the trial within shortest possible time, but not later
than four months. Parties and their learned counsels are
expected to regularly attend the Court.
