JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANTI, J.- Petitioner

Asghar, seeks bail in case FIR No.479 dated 09.06.2015,
registered under sections 399/400/401 PPC, S.15 Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act, 2013 and 5 Explosive Substance
Act, in Police Station Badh Ber Peshawar.

2. The prosecution case is that on 09.06.2015
Shah Wali Khan ASI, on receipt of spy information qua
presence of some persons near “Baba Sahib Qabristan
Sheikhan” for the purpose of dacoity/ snatching money
from the passersby, he alongwith other police officials
rushed to there and apprehend the petitioner and his
companion Mukhtiar. On search of the petitioner, a live
hand grenade was allegedly recovered from his possession,
hence, this case.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. It appears from the record that petitioner is
the resident of the same area i.e. village Sheikhan
wherefrom he has been arrested. Section 399 deals with
preparation for committing dacoity while sections 400 and
401 PPC, deal with the persons belonging to a gang of
dacoits and thieves. Not an iota of evidence is on the
record to show previous involvement of the petitioner in
any case of dacoity or theft, therefore, applicability of the
above sections of law is yet to be determined during trial.
Punishment of S.15 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Arms Act does
not fall within the Restrictive limb of S.497 Cr.P.C. while
in absence of any previous history of the petitioner in any
case of terrorism or other anti State activities, it is yet to be
proved by the prosecution that the hand grenade in
possession of the petitioner was for some subversive
purpose.

5. The above discussed circumstances, makes
the case of the petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail
within the meaning of sub-section 2 of S.497 Cr.P.C.,
therefore, he is entitled to concession of bail. Accordingly,
this petition is allowed. Accused/petitioner is admitted to
bail, provided he furnishes bail bonds to the tune of

Rs.3,00,000/- with two local, reliable and resourceful

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD concerned.

7. For what has been discussed above, Suo motu
notice given to accused Shakir stands withdrawn. He is
admitted to bail on already existing bail bonds, on merits.
Since this court has already directed expeditious
conclusion of trial while dealing with the bail petition of
co-accused Farman, therefore, office is directed to send the
record to the quarter concerned within two days, positively.
