JUDGMENT

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 20.07.2020 of the learned Judge Anti-
terrorism Court-| Peshawar, delivered in
case FIR No.98 dated 02.12.2019, whereby
the appellant has been convicted and
sentenced to fourteen years RI u/s 5 & 6 of
the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Explosive
Substances Act, 2013 with forfeiture of her
property to the State. She has also been
convicted u/s 7 (ff) of the Anti Terrorism Act,
1997 and sentenced to suffer fourteen years
RI. Both the sentences have been ordered
to run concurrently with benefit under
section 382-B Cr.PC.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
02.12.2019, Sardar Hussain Khan, SHO of
police station CTD, Peshawar (PW-11) had
an information that explosive substance will

be taken to Punjab for sabotage activity in
order to weaken the country. To foil the
attempt, he alerted his staff at Haji camp bus
stop where the spy pointed towards a
woman and two men. No sooner the
complainant tried to lay hands on the male
persons they decamped from the scene
whereas the lady with a small tin box
containing therein 5 Kg explosive substance
was overpowered, who disclosed her name
as Jehan Pasa. She also disclosed the
names of her aides as Shahid alias Malang
and Muhammad. Rehman both Afghan
nationals. In order to destroy the explosive
materials, the complainant called BDS which
defused the same. On the basis of ibid
recovery of substance case FIR was
registered against the appellant and the two
absconding accused.

3. After completion of investigation, the
case was put in court which indicted the
accused for commission of the offence to
which she pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to substantiate its
case produced and examined 13 witnesses
in all, whereafter statement of the accused
was recorded wherein she professed her
innocence. The learned trial court, after

conclusion of the trial, found her guilty of the
charge and while recording conviction
sentenced her as mentioned above.

4. Arguments heard and record gone
through.

5. The prosecution case against the
appellant mainly rests on the direct recovery
of explosive substance (Ex.PW-11/10) which
the complainant had recovered from her at
the bus stop. Though after the 6" day of her
arrest, the appellant had recorded her
statement under section 164 Cr.PC wherein
she admitted the recovery of explosive
material by the police from her but her such
confession was not believed by the learned
trial Court for its being an attempt on her
part to shift the consequences towards the
absconding co-accused.

6. To prove the direct recovery of the
explosive substance from the appellant
complainant of the case Sardar Hussain
appeared before the Court as PW-11 and
deposed that on the day of occurrence he
had received an information that someone
would bring explosive material for terrorist
activities on which he alongwith other police
personnel came to Haji camp bus stop
where the informer pointed out two men and
a lady. According to PW-11, the two male

fled away from the scene on seeing the
police whereas the lady was overpowered
from whose possession a tin box was
recovered containing therein explosive
substances and other related material which
was defused with the help of BDU staff.

7. Assuming for the sake of arguments
that the explosive substance was recovered
from the appellant but the question then
would arise whether she was having any
knowledge that the tin box recovered from
her contained therein the explosive
substance and if not then whether she could
be punished for possessing the same.
Ordinarily mere recovery of some utensil, a
box or container from someone having some
illegal material therein has never been
considered enough to hold him responsible
for possessing the banned item unless and
until it is proved through reliable evidence
that the carrier or possessor was aware of
the existence of the illegal and banned
material in the utensil, box or container
recovered from him. It is a fundamental
principle of criminal law that before an
accompanier of the principal accused is held
responsible for the illegal act, the
prosecution must prove through reliable
evidence that the former had accompanied

his master with full knowledge that the latter
was set to commit a crime which element is
missing in the instant case. It is worth to
mention that the appellant in her
confessional statement, though discarded by
the learned trial Court, and in statement
recorded under section 342 Cr.PC has
disclosed that on the day of occurrence she
was going to Akora Khattak for her spiritual
treatment with her son in law and
granddaughter and at the bus stop she was
heid up by the local police and was booked
in the case. Her such stance cannot be
brushed aside easily as the investigating
agency has not collected any material to
show that while possessing the tin box at the
relevant time she had conscious knowledge
that same had contained therein explosive
substance and that the absconding accused
were taking it through her to Punjab or
somewhere else for any terrorist activity.
Therefore, on the basis of mere recovery of
the box from her containing the explosive
substance, the appellant cannot be
punished as it is a century old principle of
criminal law that sans any conscious
knowledge qua the crime the accompanier
cannot be held responsible.

8. Thorough and careful examination of

the case record would show that the learned
trial Court has not appreciated the case
evidence in its true perspective qua
conscious knowledge of the appellant and
has errored â€˜in law by recording her
conviction for which the impugned judgment
cannot be upheld.

9. For what has been discussed above,
we accept the appeal in hand, set aside the
impugned judgment dated 02.12.2019 and
consequently acquit the appellant namely
Jehan Pasa of the charge leveled against
her. She be set free forthwith if not required
in any other case.

10. These are the reasons of our short

order of even date.
