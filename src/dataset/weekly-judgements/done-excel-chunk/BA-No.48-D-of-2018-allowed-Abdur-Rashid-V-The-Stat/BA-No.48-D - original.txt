Versus
The State, ete.
JUDGMENT
Date of hearing: 09.3.2018.
Petitioner: by Mr. Farooq Akhtar Khan advocate
Respondents:by M/S Muhammad Anwar Awan and

behalf of state.

38 28 KK

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- Through the instant
petition filed under Section 497, Cr.P.C, the
petitioners Abdul Rashid and Muhammad Bilal seek
post arrest bail in case FIR No.461 dated
30.10.2017, registered under Sections 354/337-
F(i)/337-F(vi)/34 PPC, at police station Paroa,
District D.I.Khan.

2. It has been argued by the learned
counsel for the petitioners that offence with which
the petitioners are charged, does not fall within the
prohibition contained in Section 497, Cr.P.C; that on

the face of it, the allegation against the accused-

petitioners is frivolous and false, therefore, they are
entitled to the concession of bail.

3. On the other hand, the learned counsel
representing the complainant, argued that after
release of the accused-petitioners on bail in case FIR
No.279 dated 07.6.2017, registered under Sections
506/447/427/379/411 PPC, at Police Station Paroa,
the petitioners repeated the offence, which
culminated in registration of present case; that the
petitioners misused the concession of bail already
granted to them in the previous case, therefore, they
are not entitled for bail.

4. Arguments heard and record perused
with the able assistance of learned counsel for the
parties.

5. Perusal of the record reveals that
initially, the complainant and his wife was examined
by the Medical Officer in THQ Hospital Parova, and
they were referred to DHQ Hospital, D.I.-Khan for
X-ray and expert opinion of the Orthopedic Surgeon,
but neither the X-ray report, nor report of
Orthopedic Surgeon is available on the record in
support of the MLC reports furnished by Medical
Officers of THQ Hospital Parova, though it was

mentioned in the said report that X-rays were

conducted on 26.10.2017, therefore, the case of the
petitioners squarely falls within subsection (2) of
Section 497, Cr.P.C. Even otherwise, section 337-
F(i) PPC is punishable up to one year as Ta’zir
which appears to be bailable, Section 354 PPC is
also bailable, while Section 337-F(vi) PPC does not
fall within the prohibitory part of Section 497,
Cr.P.C. It is now settled that grant of bail in a case
where the offence does not fall within the
prohibitory clause of Section 497, Cr. PC, is a rule
and its refusal is an exception. In this respect,
reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as
Tariq Bashir and 5 others Vs. The State (PLD
1995 _S.C._ 34), Zafar Iqbal Vs. Muhammad
Anwar and others (2009 SCMR 1488), Waseem
Ahmad Khan Vs. The State and another (2016
MLD 1807).

6. So far as involvement of the petitioners
in previous criminal case vide FIR No.279 dated
07.6.2017, under Sections 506/447/427/379/411
PPC, is concerned, suffice it to say, at this stage, this
Court is only seized of the instant bail petition and
effect of the previous criminal case is not relevant
for disposing of the instant petition. In this respect,

reliance can well be placed on the case reported as

urban Ali Vs. The State _and_ others (2017
SCMR 279).
7. In view of the above, the petition in
hand is allowed and the accused-petitioners are
directed to be released on bail subject to furnishing
bail bond in the sum of Rs:1,00,000/- with two
sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court, who shall ensure that the sureties
are local, reliable and men of means.

Announced.
