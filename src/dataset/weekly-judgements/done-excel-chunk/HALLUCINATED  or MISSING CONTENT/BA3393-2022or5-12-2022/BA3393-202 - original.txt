MOHAMMAD __ IBRAHIM ___ KHAN.J,
Summarization of a cursed and hexed
happening which occurred on the 9" of
September, 2022 at 08:05 hours are that at
BRT Stop near Peshawar Board, Mst. Malaika
Qazi, a medical student of Khyber Medical
University while waiting for departure to reach
her University, at such movement in time, a
blue color motorcar bearing registration No.

R-5020 reached there. The petitioner Gul

ie Muhammad alighted from it and on seeing the

complainant, caught hold of her to forcibly
compel her to sit in the motorcar. The

complainant raised hue and cry whereafter,
scores of individuals gathered there, the
petitioner in order to disburse them named her
to be his legally wedded wife and being a
family matter while dragging her to the
motorcar, snatched her iPhone 11 Pro mobile
with memory card, an amount of Rs.60,000/-
from her, which she was to deposit as her fee.
She was also ripped out of her Hijab, her face
was exposed her ears and nose were pulled.
She was wearing veil, its zip was opened, she
was targeted with cuts on her body. When she
wanted to inform her mother, her mobile was
also thrashed to the ground. So much so that
her overall was torn and the said Gul
Muhammad (accused-petitioner) also made her
videography. For all such maneuver, a report
was lodged vide FIR No.1427 dated
14.09.2022 under sections 365-B/354/427/509
PPC at Police Station Tehkal, Peshawar.

2. At first instance, the petitioner
moved an application before the court of
learned Additional Sessions Judge-XIII,
Peshawar for his post arrest bail, which was

declined on 13.10.2022. Aggrieved, from the
Nb

said order, petitioner has moved this
application for the same relief.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for
the parties and leamed Addl. AG on behalf of
the State heard and available record gone
through with their valuable assistances.

4. There is no mistaken identity as
the petitioner was known to the complainant as
prior to the occurrence, he had tried to develop
friendship with her. In a way, the occurrence
come about at the BRT Station near Peshawar
Board, a thickly populated area. The petitioner
has surpassed all the limits, who has tried his
level best to kidnap the complainant by
portraying her to be his lawfully wedded wife
and with such gestures, she might have been
thereafter compelled to marry or otherwise
seduced her to illicit intercourse. Striping off
her Hijab, exposing her physical appearance
before the gathering, may fall within the
ingredients of the conditions laid down in
section 354-A of the Pakistan Penal Code as it
may amount to her exposure to the public view

as obviously dragging her to motorcar by use
ra

of criminal force with intention to ridicule a
young girl, being a medical student and during
Struggle, her overall has been torn and she has
been harmed on her body, obviously besides,
would bring a bad name for the whole family.
It is a crime which may invite capital
punishment leaving non-existent scope for
further inquiry. Such like happening needs
strongest condemnation and grant of bail ought
to be declined.

5. In view of above, this petition
stands dismissed. The petitioner is however
favored with directive to the Prosecution to
submit complete challan within seven days after
receiving this order which be communicated to
the Superintendent of Police (Prosecution),
Peshawar and the learned trial Court without loss
of time by fixing the trial at least twice in a
week deciding the while of fortune of accused-
petitioner within a reasonable time of three

months.
