Witnesses:
❌ Partially Incorrect & Incomplete

AI states multiple eyewitnesses (Akhtar Ali, Muhammad Arif, Abdur Rahman, and Muhammad Siddiq).
Correction: These names appear in the legal precedent cited by the judge and not in the actual case. The only named witness in this case is Muhammad Ibrar (complainant). The investigating officer’s findings (blood, empties, and FSL report) may be considered, but no other eyewitnesses are named in the judgment.
