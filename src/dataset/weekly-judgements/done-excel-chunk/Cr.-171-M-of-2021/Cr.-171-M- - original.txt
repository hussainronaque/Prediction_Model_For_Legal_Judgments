02 years rigorous imprisonment, with directions to pay
Rs.50,000/- as daman to injured Noor Hayat or in default
to undergo further 03 months S.I.

All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently with
benefit of section 382-B Cr.P.C.

Injured Noor Hyat alongwith LRs of the
deceased have also filed the connected Cr.R No. 44-M/2021
against the judgment of the learned trial Court qua the
quantum of sentences awarded to the appellant. Both the
cases, being off-shoots of one and the same judgment, are

decided through this single judgment.

2. Brief but relevant facts of the case, as per
contents of Murasila drafted on 03.9.2017, are that deceased
then injured Khaista Rehman reported to IHC Ziaullah (PW-
2) at DHQ Hospital Batkhela to the effect that he was posted
as lineman in village Dheri situated within the limits of Sub-
Division Khar; that on the same day when he came home
after repairing of a Transformer, the gate of his house was
knocked in response of which he came out and saw that the
present appellant, duly armed with pistol, was present there
alongwith an unknown person who was unarmed. The
appellant questioned him for interrupting supply of
electricity to his house and brawled with him. During the
fight, Noor Hayat (PW-8), who is nephew of the deceased,

also came to the spot and was trying to separate them but the

Tajamulfes*| DB: ‘ble Mi Mi AY
Rahman as well as Noor Hayat got hit and sustained injuries
on their bodies. The occurrence was stated to have been

witnessed by Mudasir (PW-9) and Wagar Ali (abandoned).

3. Report of the deceased then injured recorded in
shape of murasila, was converted into formal F.1.R wherein
the appellant and his co-accused were initially charged u/s
324/34 PPC. Later on, complainant succumbed to the
injuries on 07.09.2017, therefore, section 302 was added in
the FIR with further addition of section 337-F(ii) PPC qua
the injuries sustained by Noor Hayat. Both the injured were
initially attended by Dr. Atta Ullah Shah (PW-4) in DHQ
hospital Batkhela who gave his opinion Ex.PW-4/1 wherein

he observed that:

Injured pt. Khaista Rahman and Noor Hayat are well oriented
with time, place and person and the injured are able to give
statement to police and he given statement to police in my
presence.

Dr. Attaullah also examined injured Noor Hayat
and found four firearm injuries on his body, the detail

whereof as per report Ex.PW-4/2 is as under:

0.5 x 0.5 cm in anterolateral aspect of right leg. Entry wound.
0.5 x 0.5 cm in anterolateral aspect of right leg. Exit wound.

Another wound 0.5 x 0.5 cm anterolateral aspect of right leg.
Entry wound.

Another wound 0.5 x 0.5 cm anterolateral aspect of right leg.
Exit wound.

The injured was referred to Peshawar for further
management.

Complainant Khaista Rahman in injured

condition was examined by Dr. Gul Rahman (PW-3) on

03.0.2017 at 10:55 P.M and gave his report Ex.PW-3/1,

which reads as follows:

Patient Khaista Rahman brought to the Emergency
department at the mentioned time and date by the attendants,
stable and oriented with history of gunshot (FAI) wearing
blue color cloths.

On examination there was a lesion of about 0.5 x 0.5 cm on
the lateral lower side of left thigh with another wound of
about Ix! cm on the medial upper side of left thigh near
scrotum crossing scrotum with the same characteristics of
wound with another wound on the medial upper side of the
right thigh measuring about 1x] cm and a wound of about
1x! cm on the upper lateral side of right thigh. There was no
other mark on the borders of wound.

Stitches were taken from the right lateral side wound of the
right thigh. Tight compressive bandages were applied to the
Edematoused scrotum and other wounds, initial treatment
was given and patient immediately referred to the tertiary
health care unit for investigation and management.

The injured complainant was also referred to

LRH Peshawar but later on he died on 07.09.2017. Post-

mortem on the dead body was conducted by Dr. Atta Ullah

(PW-4). No wound was reported in Column Nos. II to IV

except at Serial No. 13 of Column No. IV, the detail of

Khaista Rahman which is available on record as Ex: PW4/4.
4. Appellant was arrested on the following day of
the occurrence i.e., 04.09.2017 who lodged a cross report
vide Daily Diary dated 04.09.2017 alleging therein that on
03.09.2017 at about 21:30 hours he came to village Dherai
for receiving generator sent by his brother from Saudi Arabia
through Cargo; mistakenly, he knocked the door of the house
of Khaista Rahman instead of Sherin Zaman, in response
whereof Khaista Rahman came out from his house and
likewise on his call about six other persons armed with sticks,

iron rods and pistol came there, as such, Khaista Rahman

with the help of his other unknown companions started

Tajamul/cs*| 08: Hon’ble Mr, justice Muhammad Necem Anwar
beating him as result of which he sustained injuries on his

head, forehead and also suffered on his body internally.

5 Name of the absconding co-accused became later
on known as Sahib Zada alias Commando. After completion
of investigation, challan was put in Court and formal charge
was framed against the appellant but he did not plead guilty
and opted to face the trial while co-accused Sahibzada was
formally proceeded u/s 512 Cr.P.C with directions to
prosecution to produce evidence in his absence. Prosecution
produced and examined 10 PWs in support of its case and
closed its evidence. After examination of the appellant u/s
342, Cr.P.C, the learned trial Court vide judgment dated
24.06.2019 convicted and sentenced him in the same manner
as discussed earlier. Appellant challenged the judgment of
learned trial Court before this Court through his earlier
appeal Cr.A No. 305-M/2019 which was allowed vide
Judgment dated 10.02.2021 and the case was remanded to
learned trial Court with directions to examine or re-examine
all essential witnesses of the alleged cross version dated
04.09.2017 as Court witnesses who authored the report,
medico-legal report of injured/appellant and bring any other
relevant documents on the file of the present case through the
authors of those documents deemed necessary by trial Court

for just decision of the case.

Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Jisz Khan.
6. On remand of the case, the learned trial Court
recorded statements of 03 witnesses as CW-1 to CW-3 qua
the DD dated 04.09.2017 and injuries sustained by accused
by affording opportunity to both sides of cross-examination
of the said witnesses. After recording additional statement of
the appellant u/s 342, Cr.P.C. the learned trial Court found
him guilty of the charge, hence, sentenced him through the
impugned judgment in the same manner as in the first round,
the detail of which has already been given in the earlier
portion of this judgment. Hence, instant appeal and

connected revision petition.

vA We have heard the arguments of learned counsel
for the parties including the learned Assistant Advocate
General on behalf of State and perused the record with their

able assistance.

& The case of prosecution against the present
appellant is that he came to the house of deceased Khaista
Rahman on 03.09.2017 at 22:30 hours and questioned him
for disconnecting supply of electricity to the area where his
house is situated, on which a fight took place between them
during which nephew of the complainant namely Noor
Hayat also came out of his house and tried to separate them
but in the meanwhile the appellant fired at both of them with

his pistol resulting into injuries on their bodies. The injuries

Tala mul/es*| 08: Hon‘ble Mr Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad tag Khan,

sustained by complaint Khaista Rahman proved fatal
because of which he subsequently died on 07.03.2017. In
order to prove the above allegations against the appellant,
prosecution has relied upon dying declaration of the
deceased then injured available on record in shape of
Murasila Ex.PA, ocular account furnished by injured Noor
Hayat (PW-8) and Mudassir Khan (PW-9); and
circumstantial evidence comprising of medical evidence, site
plan, incriminating recoveries including the crime weapon
pistol and matching FSL report thereof with the two empties
recovered from the spot.

9 First of all, we would resort to dying declaration
of the deceased then injured incorporated in Murasila.
Dying declaration was previously governed under Section
32 of the Evidence Act, 1972. In Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 the relevant provision thereof is Article 46, which
provides that statement of a person who is dead is relevant if
it relates to the circumstance which resulted in his death and
is admissible in proceedings wherein cause of his death is a
matter in issue. A dying declaration, being the last words of
a dying person, is an exception to the hearsay rule, may be
admitted as evidence in criminal law . The rationale is that
someone, who is dying or believes death to be imminent,

would have less incentive to fabricate testimony. No doubt

Tepmutcs>| Da: Hon'ble Mr, justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Me, Justice Muhammed lag Khon,
superior Courts have held that dying declaration is a weak
type of evidence which requires deep scrutiny with great
care and caution but on the other hand it is also a settled
principle that a dying declaration can be considered as
substantive piece of evidence if the Court is satisfied about
its genuineness. Thus, dying declaration is required to be
considered on case-to-case basis in view of the attending
circumstances of each case and, if found genuine, may be
relied upon against accused. The question that when can
conviction of an accused be based on dying declaration of a
dead person, the guiding principles in this regard have been
laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court from time to time in a
number of cases, however, we would refer the case of
“Farman Ullah Vs. Qadeem Khan and another” (2001
SCMR 1474). The law enunciated in respect of dying

declaration in the said judgement can be enumerated as

under:

(i) No specified forum is available before whom dying
declaration is required to be made;

(ii) There is no bar that it cannot be made before a
private person;

(iii) There is no legal requirement that the declaration
must be read over or it must be signed by its maker;

(iv) It should be influence free;

(vi) In order to prove such declaration, the person by
whom it was recorded should be examined;

(vii) Such declaration becomes substantive evidence when
it is proved that it was made by the deceased;

(viii) Corroboration of dying declaration is not a rule of
law, but requirement of prudence and such

Tofamuies*| 08: Hon'ble Me, Justice Muhammad Nagem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr Justice Muhammad [ls Khan,
-10-

declaration when proved by cogent evidence can be
made a base for conviction.

In the present case, the occurrence took place on
03.09.2017 at 22:30 hours which was reported on the same
date at 22:50 hours, as such, the report was lodged with
exciting promptitude and there was no occasion for the
deceased then injured either for consultation and
deliberation or to record his report under the influence of
someone else for implicating the appellant in a false case,
especially, when there was no previous blood feud or even
a grudge between them. Since, the law neither requires a
specified forum before which a dying declaration is to be
made nor it is required that a dying declaration is to be
recorded in a particular form, therefore, the dying
declaration in the present case cannot be discarded for
having been recorded by an official of the Levies in shape
of Murasila. The question whether Murasila/dying
declaration had been drafted on the report of deceased then
injured Khaista Rahman, not only said report was seconded
by injured eye-witness Noor Hayat but he also verified the
contents of Murasila when appeared during the trial
proceedings as PW-8. The injured complainant and injured
Noor Hayat were well oriented in time place and person as

spelt out from certificate Ex.PW-4/1 endorsed by Dr.

Tojamul/cs*; 08: Hon'ble Mc Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-1l-

Attaullah (PW-4) who, in order to ascertain as to whether
they were able to record statements, had examined both of
them on their arrival to casualty of DHQ hospital Batkhela.
Learned counsel for the appellant has objected the
genuineness of the certificate Ex.PW-4/1 by contending
that it was later on endorsed by doctor (PW-4) at the
instance of I.O for strengthening the case against the
appellant, however, this objection of the learned counsel
has no force in it because the defence counsel has brought
nothing on record from the mouth of PWs to create even a
slightest doubt qua the genuineness of said certificate. Zia
Ullah THC (PW-2), who recorded dying declaration of
deceased then injured in shape of Murasila, has verified the
contents of said report by stating that he had read over the
report to deceased then injured whereafter he signed the
same in his presence. During cross-examination, the
defence counsel confronted the author of Murasila with
overwriting on the figure ‘9° in the date of occurrence i.e.,
03.09.2017 and father’s name of the present appellant
which was missing in the report. Overwriting on the figure
‘9’, representing the month, appears to have been made for
correction of clerical mistake as other documents prepared
by the same author on the same date bear no overwriting,

therefore, genuineness of Murasila/dying declaration

Tajamul/cs*| be; I m An
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad liaz Khan.
cannot be questioned on the basis of the mentioned ground.
Insofar as non-mentioning father’s name of the appellant by
deceased then injured and non-mentioning name of his co-
accused or his physical features are concerned, these facts
indicate spontaneous and straightforward mode of the
dying declaration as well as absence of any mala fide on
the part of injured complainant otherwise he would have
named some other person instead of an unknown accused,
hence, the objection of the learned counsel in this regard
also holds no water. Since, prosecution has adequately
discharged its burden in establishing that the dying
declaration had been recorded by deceased then injured
himself without being influenced or tutored besides the
dying declaration has been verified by injured eye-witness/
seconder of Murasila namely Noor Hayat (PW-8) as well
as by the author of dying declaration whose statements
have not been damaged during their cross-examination,
therefore, we feel no hesitation by considering dying

declaration of the deceased as a substantive piece of

evidence.

10. Another objection of the learned counsel for
appellant was that the occurrence had taken place on
03.09.2017 while the deceased died on 07.09.2017,

therefore, in view of the mentioned interval, death of the

Tajemut/es+| OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad lez Khon,
-13-

deceased was not the direct consequence of the injuries
attributed to the appellant. No doubt, the deceased had
expired after four days of the occurrence as reflected from
post-mortem report conducted by Dr. Attaullah (PW-4) as
well as death certificate issued by him, however, he has
reported two entry and two exit wounds on the body of
deceased. As per pictorial annexed with the post-mortem
report, both the entry wounds were caused by same bullet
first hitting the lateral side of left thigh making its exit near
the scrotum by causing damage thereto and made exit on the
lateral side of right thigh in upward direction. It was brought
during cross-examination of doctor (PW-4) that local
anesthesia had been given to the injured complainant at
Peshawar which not only suggests that deceased then injured
was conscious even at the time of his arrival to Peshawar but
the locale of injuries also shows that he was not under the
immediate apprehension of death. In a similar situation in

the case of “Sabir and others Vs. The State and others”

(2001 SCMR 94), wherein the deceased had died after five
days of the occurrence, the Hon’ble apex Court held that the
fact that deceased expired after five days further confirms
that there was no eminent danger of his death and made the
statement consciously. In the present case, when the

deceased had died after four days of the occurrence, whether

Tojamutfcs+| OB: Hon‘bie Mir Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad tisz Khan,
-14-,

his report can legitimately be treated as dying declaration or
not, this question has been resolved by august Supreme
Court of Pakistan in the case of “Wazir Gul Vs. The State”
(1975 SCMR 2839) by observing that:
In the first instance, the law does not insist that for the
purpose of being treated as a dying declaration, the
statement should have been made under immediate
apprehension of death. We cannot import into the
statutory provision any such extraneous limitation. In
the absence of a statutory requirement in this regard,
the last incriminating statement made by the deceased
could be legitimately treated as dying declaration as
was rightly done in the instant case. It was a quite

unembellished and straightforward statement having a
ring of truth.

The record shows that after the occurrence, the
deceased was taken to DHQ hospital Barkhela in injured
condition where he was examined by Dr. Gul Rahman (PW-
3) who, after applying tight compressive bandages to the
wounds, referred him to LRH Peshawar for further
management. After his death, he was brought back to
Batkhela hospital on 07.09.2017 and post-mortem was
conducted on the same day. The learned defence counsel has
taxingly cross-examined the PWs especially Dr. Attaullah
(PW-4) to shatter his opinion regarding death of the deceased
as direct result of the injuries he had sustained in the
occurrence and likewise the appellant has taken the plea in
his statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C that death of the deceased had

not occurred as consequence of the injuries he had sustained

Tajamuilcs*| 0B: Hon‘ble Mr Justice Muhammad Nacem Agwar
Hon'ble Mt Justice Muhammad .tiez Khan,
-15-

in the occurrence. The above objections on behalf of defence
are dealt with under the doctrine of Novus Actus
Interveniens, a Latin phrase which literally means ‘new act
intervening’. According to explanation in Advanced Law
Lexicon (5th Edition) Volume 3, the phrase means there
was not such a direct relationship between the act of
negligence and the injury that the one could be treated as
flowing directly from the other. Thus, the doctrine mainly
speaks about a new act or event intervening between the
injury as result of initial act and death of the injured. In other
words, an accused who caused injury to a person resulting
into his death would be held responsible for murder of the
latter but under the above principle, he cannot be held
criminally liable for the consequences of a new event which
intervened between the initial injury and death of the

deceased. The Supreme Court of Canada in the case titled

Kenneth F,. Salomon And Sterathal Katzaelson Montigny
LLP Vs. Judith Matte-Thompson And 166376 Canada

Inc.” reported as 2019 SCMR 238 has laid down two
conditions for applicability of the principle of Novus Actus
Interveniens firstly, the causal link between the fault and the
injury must be completely broken. Secondly, there must be a
causal link between that new event and the injury. However,

in the present case, neither the learned defence counsel was

tapamuyes*| OB: Hon'ble Mr, justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Me, Justice Muhammad lat Khan,
-16-

able to bring on record something from PWs that the
deceased had sustained any injury other than those reported
by Dr. Gul Rahman in his medico-legal report Ex.PW-3/1
nor the medical evidence divulge that some event had
happened to break the causal chain between the injuries
sustained by deceased at the time of occurrence and his
death. Thus, the two conditions mentioned above have not
fulfilled, therefore, the doctrine of Novus Actus Interveniens
cannot be applied to the present case, as such, the irresistible
conclusion is that death of the deceased was the logic and
direct consequence of the injuries he had sustained in the
occurrence by firing of the appellant, which have been
reported in medico-legal report in Ex.PW-3/1.

i. Learned counsel for the appellant, while placing

reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case titled

“Shah Rukh Vs. The State” (2013 P Cr. L J 237) raised
another objection that dying declaration had not been put to
the appellant during his examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C,
therefore, the last incriminating statement of deceased
cannot be used against him. No doubt, it is settled principle
of law that if any incriminating piece of evidence is not put
to an accused in his statement under section 342, Cr.P.C. for
his explanation then the same cannot be used against him for

his conviction, however, we do not find ourselves in

Tejamuives+| 0B: Hon'ble Mr Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Me Justice Muhammad [az Khan,
-17-

agreement with the contention of the learned counsel for the
reason that dying declaration in the present case is available
on record in shape of Murasila (Ex.PA) on the basis whereof
FIR (Ex.PW-7/1) was chalked out against the appellant.
Though the word ‘dying declaration’ has not been
specifically mentioned in statement of the appellant u/s 342,
Cr.P.C but he has duly been confronted with Murasila and
FIR in question No.3, which is reproduced below for the

sake of convenience.

In our view, when Murasila and FIR have been
put to appellant during his examination w/s 342, Cr.P.C, non-
specification of the term ‘dying declaration’ would not make
any difference. Especially when the appellant has made only
denial to above question. Thus, the dying declaration in the
present case, being straightforward and confidence inspiring
can safely be relied upon towards the guilt of appellant.

12, It is a well-settled principle of law, as observed

by Hon’ble apex Court in the case of “Majeed V4. The

Teamulcs>| OB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mn lustice Muhammad Ila Khao,
-18-

State” (2010 SCMR 55) that a dying declaration, if made
even before a private person, is free from influence and the
person before whom such dying declaration was made was
examined then it becomes substantive piece of evidence and
for that no corroboration is required and such declaration
can be made basis of conviction, as such, in light of the rule
laid down in the afore-referred judgment, corroboration of
dying declaration is not a rule of law, but requirement of
prudence, In the present case, besides the dying declaration,
which by itself is sufficient to base conviction of the
appellant, there is also unimpeached ocular account and
circumstantial evidence of convincing nature on record
through which prosecution has proved the guilt of appellant
beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. Noor Hayat, who was
victim of the same occurrence and verified the dying
declaration by signing the same in hospital, appeared in the
witness box as PW-8. In examination-in-chief, he reiterated
the same facts as emerging from FIR. His presence on the
spot at the time of occurrence cannot be doubted in view of
firearm injuries on his person because of which he was
shifted to DHQ hospital Batkhela for medical treatment
alongwith the deceased at the same time though through a
separate vehicle. He had attracted to the sport on hearing

commotion in the street where he found the deceased and

Tajamul/cs*| DB: bl
Hon’ q Naz KI
-19-

appellant indulged in a fight with each other. He tried to
separate them but the appellant opened firing resulting into
injuries on him as well as deceased. During cross
examination he stated that when he came out, the deceased
and appellant were fighting with each other which
continued for 4/5 minutes. Although I.O has not shown the
house of the injured witness in the site plan, however, this
omission on the part of 1.0 is not sufficient to damage the
version of injured eye-witness when admittedly he is
nephew of the deceased and his house is situated in the
same vicinity as reflected from his answers to various
questions put to him by defence counsel during his cross-
examination. The stamps of firearm injuries on his person
are sufficient to establish his presence on the spot and we
have no reason to discredit his statement, being honest,
straightforward, natural and having ring of truth. Reliance
is placed on “Shah Nawaz and 02 others Vs. The State”
reported as 2011 SCMR 713.

13. Mudassir Khan (PW-9) was also examined as
eye-witness of the occurrence. He is a natural eye-witness of
the occurrence as he is son of the deceased while the
occurrence had taken place in front of his house. The
deceased then injured, at the time of lodging the report, duly

mentioned him and his other son Wagar Ali (abandoned) as

Tajamutcs*| D8: Mane Mr. Juice Muhammad Netem Aawat
Hon’ble Mr Justice Muhammed Haz Khan.
-20-

eye-witnesses of the occurrence. Though his name has not
been mentioned in medico-legal report of the deceased on
the injury sheet but he stated in his cross-examination that
he, Majid, Hssan Zaman, Wagar Ali and Noor Hayat had
come to the spot and they had taken his father and uncle to
hospital for medical treatment. He recorded his examination-
in-chief in line of the dying declaration and statement of the
injured eye-witness. When confronted during cross-
examination with regard to firing and role of injured Noor
Hayat, this witness confirmed that when he and Wagar Ali
came out of the house, his uncle Noor Hayat was trying to
release the deceased and appellant. Further stated that his
uncle had managed to release the deceased from the
appellant but thereafter the appellant fired at both of them.
This witness and injured Noor Hayat were specifically asked
regarding arrival of other people to the spot but PW
Mudassir plainly stated during his cross-examination that
they had shifted the injured persons to hospital after 3/4
minutes of the occurrence. Their ignorance about presence
of other people on the spot after the occurrence is natural
because they had shortly left the spot for shifting the injured
persons to hospital as the circumstances demanded. Though
the occurrence has taken place during nocturnal hours but

1.0 has taken into possession an energy saver bulb from the

Taarulcs"| DB: —_Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammed Nacem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Wlaz Khan,
-2)-

gate of the deceased’s house in front of which the
occurrence had taken place. Hence, there was no
apprehension of misidentification of the appellant by both
the eye-witnesses. Though the defence counsel has put a
suggestion to both the eye-witnesses that there was storm at
the time of occurrence because of which electricity was
disconnected, however, the occurrence had taken place
because of disconnection of electricity to the house of
appellant and for the said reason he had come to the house
of deceased. Had the power shut down happened because of
storm and heavy rain at the relevant time, the unfortunate
incident would have never taken place as in that eventuality
the appellant would have no justification to enter into a fight
with the deceased. Both the eye-witnesses have supported
each other on material particulars of the occurrence and they
have remained firm and consistent during  cross-
examination. No doubt, they are closely related with the
deceased besides PW Noor Hayat is victim of the same
occurrence, but they cannot be disbelieved on the sole
ground of their close relationship with the deceased when
otherwise they have given a truthful account of the
occurrence in a straightforward manner nor there was any

“Sajid_Mehmood_Vs._The State” (2022 SCMR 1882)

wherein the Hon’ble apex Court has held that:

As far as the question that the complainant was
brother of the deceased, therefore, his testimony
cannot be believed to sustain conviction of the
appellant is concerned, it is by now a well-established
principle of law that mere relationship of the
prosecution witnesses with the deceased cannot be a
ground to discard the testimony of such witnesses
unless previous enmity or ill will is established on the
record to falsely implicate the accused in the case.

In view of the above settled principle, the ocular
account of both the PWs is worth reliance irrespective of
their close relationship with the deceased. It is not a rule of
universal application that a disinterested or independent
witness will always tell the whole truth and a related or
interested witness will utter only lies before the Court. When
the Court is satisfied that a witness, though related to
deceased or interested in conviction of accused, has told the
truth then his testimony should be accepted without any
hesitation. As regards the objection of learned counsel for
the appellant regarding non-association of inmates of the
deceased’s house and other independent people of the
muhalla, since, prosecution has fully established the guilt of
appellant beyond shadow of doubt through direct and
circumstantial evidence, therefore, non-association of other

inmates of the house of deceased or residents of the locality

Tajamul/cs* OB: Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Nacem Anwar
-23-

with the process of investigation would not damage the
prosecution case.

14, The version of deceased then injured in his dying
declaration and ocular account is further corroborated by
circumstantial evidence on record. Post-mortem report of the
deceased and medico-legal report of the injured eye-witness
are in line with the prosecution version. I.O has collected
blood of the deceased and injured from the spot and secured
their blood-stained garments as well as slippers of the
deceased. The matching FSL report in this regard is
available on record as Ex.PW-10/21. The crime weapon, a
30-bore pistol has been recovered on pointation of the
appellant which has matched with the two crime empties
recovered from the spot. Report of the Fire Arms Expert in
this regard is Ex.PW-10/20. Objection of the learned counsel
for the appellant that no private person was associated with
the recovery, is having no force because the recovery was
made from a stream, a non-residential area, therefore, in our
view non-compliance of section 103, Cr.P.C is condonable
in such situation. Reliance is placed on “Mir Muhammad

V/s. The State” (1995 SCMR 614), wherein it was observed

that:
“The plain reading of section 103, Cr.P.C. would show
that the provisions of this section apply to a case
where the Police conducts search of a house/place to
Tajamul/Cs*| DB: Hon’ble Mr Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar

Hon‘ble Mr, justice Muhemmed ties Khan,
-24-

recover an article for which search is to be made and
not to a case where anything is to be discovered in
consequence of the information given by or on the
pointation of the accused. The recovery to be made on
the pointation of the accused is relevant under Article
40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. The association of
the two respectable inhabitants of the locality is not
required in a case where the accused himself leads the
Police to a particular place and gets the article
recovered”,

Prosecution has discharged its onus in bringing home
guilt of the appellant beyond shadow of doubt through direct
as well as circumstantial evidence, therefore, he was rightly
convicted by learned trial Court.

15, Learned counsel for the appellant also
controverted the motive as well as the mode and manner of
the occurrence. The evidence on record reflects that
deceased was serving as lineman in WAPDA and appellant
had come to his house at late evening time to question him
for disconnecting electricity of his village Jarbutt and some
other adjacent areas. Though specific evidence to this effect
is not available on record but on the other hand the motive
so set up by prosecution has not been challenged before the
learned trial Court. Keeping in view the attending facts and
circumstances of the present case especially the place and
time of occurrence, the motive mentioned by deceased then

injured in his dying declaration appeals to prudent mind.

Even otherwise, the law is settled that motive is not the

Toamuvcs+| DB: ——--Hontble Mr. Justice Muhammed Necem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Itaz Khon,
-25-

requirement of law and conviction can be recorded even in
the absence of motive. Reliance in this regard is placed on

“Mukhtar Ahmad and others Vs. The State” (PLD 2004 S.C

563). In another case titled “Hameed Khan alias Hameedai

Vs. Ashraf Shah and another” (2002 SCMR 1155) the

Hon’ble apex Court of Pakistan held that absence of motive

or failure to prove the motive would not adversely affect the
prosecution case if it has been proved by reliable evidence.
Insofar as the mode and manner of the occurrence are
concerned, the fight took place between the parties in front
of the house of deceased. Identification of the appellant by
deceased then injured and eye-witnesses cannot be
questioned for the reasons that both the parties are residents
of the same area. There was no previous enmity between the
parties, as such, there was no need for the appellant to
conceal his identity rather he had come to the house of
deceased to interrogate him for disconnecting electricity of
his village. I.O has taken into possession an energy saver
bulb from the main gate of deceased’s house in light of
which the deceased and eye-witnesses had identified the
appellant. All the events of the occurrence have been
brought on the record in a natural manner and nothing is
available on record to suggest fabrication or maneuvering of

evidence by prosecution. Though there are some

Taamulcs¢| 0B: Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Nagem Anwar
Hon’ble Mr, Justice Muhammed lez Khon,
-26-

contradictions in the statements of PWs but same can be
ignored being minor in nature and not capable of having
adverse bearing on the prosecution case when other
overwhelming evidence is available on record against the

appellant. Reliance is placed on “Zulfigar Ahmad and

another Vs. The State” (2011 SCMR 492) wherein it was

held that minor contradictions do creep in with the passage
of time and can be ignored.
16. Adverting to the defence version, while deciding
earlier appeal of the appellant, this Court had taken notice of
the cross report lodged by appellant through DD dated
04.09.2017 against the deceased and other unknown accused
for causing him injury on his forehead. Since, the documents
of the cross version had not been brought on the record
through the respective authors, therefore, the case was
remanded to the learned trial Court for doing the needful in
accordance with law. During the post-remand proceedings,
Abdul Kamal IHC was examined as CW-1 who arrested the
appellant on 04.09.2017 in injured condition and produced
him before Dr. Shafiq (CW-2) at 22:02 hours for medical
examination who, after examining the appellant, recorded
his opinion in his report (Ex.CW-2/1) on the injury sheet.
Said report is as under:

Patient Muqadar Khan ID 15402-0753309-1 s/o Mir

Afzal brought by AHC Abdul Kamal at 10:02 P.M on

Tajamul/Cs*: DB: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Netem Anwar
Hon'ble My, Justice Muhammed lis: Khan,

-27-

04.09.2017 vitally stable having 01 cm long laceration
skin deep at forehead with two stitches and dressing done
at Private Hospital.

During cross-examination he stated that the
dressing and stitching of the wound had already been done
in private hospital. Muharrir Sardar Ali was examined as
CW-3 who had recorded report of the appellant through DD
No. 9 dated 04.09.2017 (Ex. CW-3/2). When confronted
with Q.1 in his statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C during post-
remand proceedings, appellant stated that deceased had
committed aggression because of which he had sustained
injury on his forehead. The record reflects that appellant has
adopted two distinct versions regarding the injury on his
body. The first is emerging from cross-examination of his
counsel upon the I.0 to whom a suggestion was put that he
had tortured the appellant during custody by causing injury
on his forehead but during examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C, the
appellant took another plea by attributing the injury to
deceased blaming him for aggression. In light of the cross
version and injury on the forehead of the appellant, his
learned counsel contended that not only complainant has
suppressed the injury of the appellant which creates a
reasonable doubt in prudent mind qua the genuineness of the
prosecution case but the appellant had acted in his self-

defence, therefore, the learned trial Court has illegally

Tajamutcs+| 8: Hon‘ble Mc Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
- 28 -

convicted him u/s 302(b) PPC instead of section 302(c). In
support of his above contention, he placed reliance on
“Muhammad Javed Vs. The State” (2020 SCMR 2116),

“Muhammad Ashraf alias Nikka Vs. The State” (2022
SCMR 1328), “Abdur Rehman Vs. Sabir Hussain and

others” (2016 P Cr. L J 888), “Ibrahim and others Vs. The

State (2015 P Cr. L J 712), “Sultanat Khan Vs. The State

and another” (2018 P Cr. L J 1563) and an unreported
judgment of this Court dated 14.01.2021 in Cr.A No. 302-
M/2019 titled “Saif Ullah Vs. Wahid Shah and another”.
He further contended that though the appellant has not
specifically taken the plea of self-defence during his
examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C, however, the Court can
consider the same if reflected from evidence on record.
Before recording our findings on the above contention of the
learned counsel, it is important to note that appellant has
neither disowned the report recorded vide daily diary nor
denied his presence on the spot at the time of occurrence, as
such, the above facts are admitted on record in support of
the prosecution version. Insofar as the submission of learned
counsel for the appellant with regard to suppression of injury
on the body of appellant is concerned, according to medico-
legal report Ex.CW-2/1, appellant sustained a single

lacerated skin deep wound of 01 cm in size on his forehead

Tajarnutes*| 08: Hon‘ble tat Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon‘ble Mr, Justice Muhammed [as Khan,
-29-

for which he charged the deceased and 06 other unknown
persons. The question that who was aggressor and who was
aggressed upon, seems well explained in light of the
attending circumstances of the present case. Admittedly, the
occurrence took place in front of the house of deceased at
night time which fact is sufficient to establish that appellant
had come to the house of deceased at night time, in such
situation it would be very hard to conclude that complainant
and his companions were aggressors especially when two
were injured from complainant side (the deceased and PW
Noor Hayat) as result of firing of the appellant. Neither any
firearm was recovered from deceased or his companions nor
any empty, except the two of 30 bore which have matched
with the pistol of appellant, was recovered from the spot.
Even the I.O has not recovered the blood of appellant from
the spot to corroborate his contention, therefore, it cannot be
said with certainty as to whether the injury was self-inflicted
or it was caused by the rival party. In the above stated
attending facts and circumstances of the case, the alleged
suppression of the injury sustained by appellant by
complainant side would not damage the prosecution case. As
regards the contention of learned counsel for the appellant
that original record of the cross-version is missing and I.O

had not investigated that case at all, it appears that appellant

Taamulcs*| OB: Hon'ble Mr Justice Muhammad Necem Anwar

Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad tla Khao,
-30-

has raised this objection for the first time before this Court
as no application to this effect is available on the record on
behalf of appellant before the learned trial Court.

17. Regarding the pleas of appellant with regard to
self defence as well as his version that deceased had got hit
by the firing of his own companions as emerging from his
statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C., it is a well-celebrated principle
of criminal administration of justice that initial burden is
always on prosecution to prove the guilt of accused beyond
shadow of reasonable doubt. In case of failure of
prosecution in proving the guilt of accused, no burden would
lie on accused to prove his defence plea, if any, however,
when prosecution succeeds in discharging its onus of
establishing the guilt of an accused through evidence then
the accused is bound under Article 121 of Qanun-e-Shahdat
Order, 1984 to prove his plea of defence. Guidance in this

regard is sought from “Ali Ahmad and another Vs. The

State and others” (PLD 2020 S.C 201) wherein it was held
that burden shifted upon the accused under Art.121 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 to prove his defence plea, only
when a prima facie case was made out against him by the
prosecution on the basis of its evidence. Further held that if
the prosecution failed to prove its case against the accused,

the question of shifting of burden on the accused did not

Tajamulcs*| Os: Hon’ble Me. Justice Mvhammad Naeem Anwat
Hon'ble Mr. ustise Muhammad liax khan,
-31-

arise. In the present case, a specific plea of self defence is
emerging from statement u/s 342, Cr.P.C of the appellant in
support of which his learned counsel has advanced his
arguments by placing reliance on various judgment of the
Hon’ble apex Court as well as this Court. Although it is
settled law that if the plea of self defence is not specifically
taken by accused but the evidence on record suggests so,
same may be deduced and considered in his favour,
however, in the present case the situation is altogether
different. We have already mentioned above that appellant
has adopted two versions in respect of the injury on his
person firstly; it was attributed to I.O with the allegation that
he had caused the injury to appellant by subjecting him to
torture during police custody by concealing his arrest on
03.09.2022 and secondly; he took another plea during his
examination u/s 342, Cr.P.C by stating that the injury was
caused to him by complainant side being aggressors. Hence,
taking divergent pleas at the same time, the appellant
himself is not consistent, therefore, it cannot be ascertained
that which of the two versions of the appellant is correct.
The burden was on appellant to prove his above version,
however, neither he recorded his own statement on oath nor
produced any witness in support of his above contention.

Even he did not move any application for summoning the

Talamulcs*| bb: Hon'ble Mir. Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
Hon'ble Mr, Justice Muhammad Ila Khan,
-32-

doctor who had stitched his wound in a private clinic. The
defence counsel has not put a single question to eye-
witnesses regarding the injury on the body of appellant or
with regard to the firing allegedly made upon the accused
rather they were suggested that some unknown accused had
made the firing which was specifically denied by both the
eye-witnesses. In such situation, bald statement of the
appellant would not benefit him nor on the basis thereof the
prosecution evidence could be discarded. Reliance in this
regard is placed on “Muhammad Arif Vs. The State” (2008
Y LR 291 Karachi) wherein it was observed that law
required that if accused had a defence plea, same should
have been put up to the witnesses in cross-examination and
then put up the same at the time of recording the statement
under $.342, Cr.P.C. The evidence brought forth by
prosecution against the appellant is sufficient to prove the
guilt of appellant beyond shadow of doubt; the appellant has
admitted his presence on the spot by taking a specific plea in
his defence but failed to prove the same in view of his
burden under Article 121 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order,
1984, thus, there is even no reasonable possibility of defence
plea being true. In almost similar situation in the case of

“Muhammad Javed Vs. The State” (2015 SCMR 864), the

Tajamul/Cs* 0B: Hon‘bie Mr Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar
-33-

Hon’ble Supreme Court maintained conviction of the

accused by holding that:
According to the provisions of Article 121 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the onus to prove his
plea of exercise of private defence was squarely upon
the petitioner but he had utterly failed to discharge that
onus inasmuch as he had neither made any statement
on oath under section 340(2), Cr,P.C. nor had he

produced any witness in his defence who could support
the version of the incident advanced by him.

The case law referred by learned counsel for the
appellant cannot be applied to the present case in view of its
peculiar and distinct facts and circumstances.

18, Prosecution has proved its case against the
appellant beyond shadow of doubt through trustworthy and
reliable direct and circumstantial evidence which has
properly been appreciated by learned trial Court, hence,
conviction of the appellant for murder of deceased and
attempting at the life of injured Noor Hayat is not open to
any exception. No doubt, the appellant was armed with
pistol at the relevant time but in view of the motive
mentioned by deceased in his dying declaration and in
absence of previous enmity between the parties, it cannot be
concluded that appellant had left his house with the intention
to kill the deceased. One person has died in the occurrence
by sustaining injuries though as a result of a single fire shot

but another person was also wounded in the same

Talsmulcs*| OB:

-34-

occurrence by sustaining two entry wounds on his body. In
the afore-mentioned situation, neither we deem it just to
award death penalty to appellant nor it would be a fair and
Just decision to convert conviction of the appellant from
section 302(b) to 302(c) PPPC. Thus, the connected revision
petition filed by injured and LRs of the deceased is devoid
of any force.

19. For what has been discussed above, instant
appeal as well as the connected Cr.R No. 44-M/2021, having
no force, are accordingly dismissed, resultantly, conviction
and sentences of the appellant recorded by learned trial

Court in the impugned judgment are maintained.
