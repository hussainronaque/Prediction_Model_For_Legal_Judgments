ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.- Petitioner, Zahid Hussain,
seeks his release on bail in case FIR No.362 dated
14.05.2017 under sections 15-AA/5 Explosive registered
at Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar.

2. The brief facts of the case are that on 14.05.2017
at 2030 hours, the complainant, Syed Sardar Ali Shah,
SHO P.S. Daudzai was on combining operation in the
area, he also conducted raid at the house of one Ijaz son
of Mir Ahmad Shah, who is a proclaimed offender in
case FIR No.69 dated 27.1.2017 registered under sections
302/324/34 PPC of Police Station, Daudzai, Peshawar
was wanted by the police, but the said P.O. was not found
at his house, however, the police party found the present
accused/petitioner in the house of said P.O. The personal
search of the accused/petitioner led to the recovery of a 9

MM Pistol bearing No.013008-10-CN-236 loaded
alongwith 26 live rounds of the same bore and 03 hand
grenades. The accused/petitioner could not produce any
valid license or permit for carrying the said deadly
weapons and explosives, hence the FIR.

3. The learned counsel for the petitioner
contended that the accused/petitioner is innocent and has
falsely been implicated in the case with ulterior motive
by the police; Further contended that under Section 7 of
the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 permission of the
Provincial Government must be obtained but in the
instant case no permission has yet been obtained. Further
submitted that there is no mentioned serial numbers with
regard to hand grenades; that there is no independent
evidence against the accused/petitioner on the file as
required under Section 103 Cr.PC; Learned counsel for
petitioner further argued that the accused/petitioner is
first offender and never involved previously in such like
cases; and that the charge leveled against the
accused/petitioner requires further probe into his guilt
and as such, he is entitled to the concession of bail.

Learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on

case titled Shah Zaman Vs The State (2012 MLD 410),
Habib-ur-Rehman Vs. The State (2012 YLR_ 665),

Zain-ul-Abidin Vs. The State (2010 MLD 173) and

Karamat Khan Vs. The State (2011 YLR 1390).
4. On the other hand, the learned AAG on
behalf of State opposed the arguments of learned counsel
for the petitioner and contended that the
accused/petitioner is directly charged in the FIR and
recovery has been effected from his personal possession.
Further contended that the offence, with which the
petitioner is charged heinous in nature and also falls
within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.PC. In
these circumstances, the accused/petitioner is not entitled
to the concession of bail.

5. I have heard learned counsel for the
petitioner, learned AAG on behalf of State and perused
the available record with their assistance.

6. Perusal of record would show that no
permission/sanction from the Provincial Government/
competent authority is available on record as required
under Section 7 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908,
for holding a trial in the case of accused/petitioner, which
is mandatory. The record would further reveal that no
public witness of the locality as required under Section
103 Cr.PC was associated with the recovery proceedings.
The Expert report is also not available on record to
ascertain as to whether the recovered arms and
ammunition were in working condition or not. The

recovery of three hand grenades from one side pocket is
also intolerable/impossible and also no serial number has
been mentioned of the said hand grenades and thus case
of the accused/petitioner is made out that of further
inquiry. Besides, the petitioner is behind the bars since
his arrest and there is no prospect of conclusion of his
trial in the near future.

7. For the reasons discussed above, the
instant bail application is allowed and _ the
accused/petitioner is admitted to bail subject to furnishing
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/- with two sureties
each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate. The sureties must be reliable and
men of means.

8. Above are the reasons of my short order of
even date.

Announced.
