WIQAR__AHMAD, _J.- Sajjad =Ahmad,
complainant of the case, lodged report of the
occurrence at RHC Phulra on 23.07.2021 at
15:05 hours and stated therein that he
alongwith his injured brother namely, Sarfaraz
had been going to mosque of the village for
offering their “Juma” prayers. When they
reached near house of Muhammad Shahid,
they found Rustam s/o Faqir Muhammad
(accused-respondent) alongwith his sister
Mst. Naheeda Bibi (co-accused) residents of
same village at 13:30 hours. Rustam
accused-respondent allegedly took out his 30-
bore pistol and made firing at Sarfaraz with
intention to kill him, as a result of which he
received injury and fall on ground. Their
cousin namely, Abdul Basit, also reached to
the spot in meanwhile, who also got

entangled with Rustam, as a result, he too
received minor injury on his right hand. Co-
accused (Mst. Naheeda Bibi) was also
alleged to have abused them and gave
beating to the injured. A dispute arising out
from an earlier divorce by deceased Sarfaraz
to Mst. Naheeda Bibi was stated to have
constituted motive for commission of the
offence. Initially, murasila and FIR were
entered under Section 324 PPC but later on
the injured died, as a result of injury so
received, therefore, section of law was
substituted by Section 302 PPC.

2. Accused-respondent was arrested on
15.08.2021 and he filed an application for his
release on bail which was allowed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge Mansehra vide
order dated 10.01.2022. Thereafter, petitioner
has filed the instant petition for recalling of the
ibid bail granting order.

3. Learned counsel for petitioner stated
during the course of his arguments that
accused-respondent had _ directly been
charged for effective role of causing firearm
injury to deceased then alive and that weapon
of offence had also been recovered on his
pointation but despite that he was released on

bail by learned lower court, which order was
perverse and arbitrary, therefore, liable to be
recalled. He placed reliance on the judgments
delivered by Hon’ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in the cases of “Abdul Aziz Vs.
Saleh Muhammad & another” reported as
1990 SCMR 346, “Mumtaz Vs. The State”
reported as 2012 SCMR 556, “Abdul Hayee &
02 others Vs. The State” reported as 1996
SCMR 555, “Muhammad Irfan Vs. The State
& another’ reported as 2020 SCMR 2017 and
“Sidra Abbas Vs. The State & another”
reported as 2020 SCMR 2089.

4. Learned counsel for accused-
respondent stated in rebuttal that though in
the FIR a 30-bore pistol had been statedly
used in the crime but later on Investigating
Officer had shown 9MM pistol recovered from
the accused on his pointation. Besides, he
also stated that statement of one eyewitness
namely, Abdul Basit, has been recorded with
a delay of 35 days, therefore, case against
the accused was that of further probe. He
placed reliance on the judgments of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan delivered in the
cases of “Muhammad Asif Vs. The State”

reported as 2017 SCMR 486 and “Abdul
Majid Afridi Vs. The State & another” reported
as 2022 SCMR 676.

5. Learned Assistant Advocate General
supported the submissions of learned counsel
for petitioner in his arguments.

6. | have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties as well as learned
Assistant Advocate General and gone
through record. It needs mention herein that
State had not been made party in the instant
bail cancellation, therefore, on the request of
learned Assistant Advocate General, State
was impleaded on the panel of respondent as
respondent No.2. Office is directed to make
necessary entries in heading of petition and
record in this respect.

7. Perusal of record reveals that
accused-respondent was directly named in
the FIR at the first instance for effective role
of causing firearm injury to brother of
complainant namely, Sarfaraz. The
postmortem report was also _ supporting
version of complainant. Reasonable grounds
did exist to believe that accused-respondent
was connected with commission of offence,
which was falling within the prohibitory clause

of Section 497 Cr.P.C but despite that learned
lower court has released the accused on bail
and that also by ordering him to furnish surety
in a meager amount of just Rs.1,00,000/-. The
reasons advanced by learned lower court
while releasing accused on bail were also
flimsy in nature. The court below has also
tried to appreciate evidence deeply and has
also drawn illogical presumptions therefrom.
Deeper appreciation made for making a
ground for bail was also not allowable at this
stage but the reasoning made therein is also
very strange and the presumptions drawn
cannot be called to be legal, allowable or
appealing to a prudent mind. Two specific
reasons have also been given which included
that in the FIR complainant had stated that
firing had been made with 30-bore pistol while
later on a 9MM pistol had been recovered on
pointation of accused-respondent and _ that
statement of one PW namely Abdul Basit had
been recorded after a delay of almost one
month. Besides, plea of consistency has also
been applied. All these reasons were also not
appropriate for consideration in releasing the
accused on bail. So far as weapon of offence
is concerned, these pistols of 30-bore and

9MM are manufactured by numerous local
and foreign manufacturers in different shapes
and modes. Just on seeing a pistol in
somebody else hand is not always sufficient
to determine its bore with exactitude. So far
as delayed statement of one of PW Abdul
Basit is concerned, it is important to be noted
that prosecution was also having other
evidence against accused-respondent which
included statement of complainant and other
corroboratory evidence in the shape of
postmortem report, recovery of weapon of
offence etc, therefore, the only reason that
statement of one of the witness had been
recorded with a delay of 35 days was also not
sufficient to make the case one of further
enquiry. The principle of consistency has also
been wrongly applied in the case. The lady
co-accused namely, Mst. Naheeda Bibi had
been treated to be having a role at par with
the present accused-respondent by the court
below without realizing the fact that role of
causing firearm injury to deceased had solely
been attributed to accused-respondent by
complainant. None of the grounds for
releasing accused-respondent on bail was
available to learned court below. In such a

case it was not difficult to dub the bail
granting order as arbitrary and perverse.
While explaining the connotation “perverse”,
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held
in its judgment rendered in the case of “Sidra
Abbas Vs. The State & another” reported as
2020 SCMR 2089;

“In legal parlance, a perverse
order is defined as an order which
is, inter alia, entirely against the
weight of the evidence on record.’
It is always to be kept in mind that
in cases where the court granting
bail ignores’ relevant material
indicating prima facie involvement
of the accused in the commission
of crime or takes into account
irrelevant material, which has no
relevance to the question of grant
of bail to the accused, then the
Court reviewing such order would

be justified in cancelling the bail.”
8. So far as reliance of learned counsel
for accused-respondent on the judgment
delivered in the case of “Abdul Majid Afridi Vs.
The State” reported as 2022 SCMR 676 is
concerned, even there the Hon’ble Apex
Court had relied on judgment in the case of
“Samiullah Vs. Laiq Zada” reported as 2020
SCMR 1115, where the following
considerations had been categorized for

recalling of bail;
"i) If the bail granting order is
patently illegal, erroneous,
factually incorrect and _ has
resulted into miscarriage of
justice.

ii) That the accused has misused
the concession of bail in any
manner.

iii) That accused has tried to
hamper prosecution evidence by
persuading/pressurizing
prosecution witnesses.

iv) That there is likelihood of
absconsion of the accused beyond
the jurisdiction of court.

v) That — the accused _ has
attempted to interfere with the
smooth course of investigation.

vi) That accused misused his
liberty while indulging into similar
offence.

vii)That some fresh facts and
material have been _ collected
during the course of investigation
which tends to establish guilt of

the accused."
9. The first consideration is that where
bail granting order is_ patently _ illegal,
erroneous, factually incorrect and causes
miscarriage of justice, then same may be
recalled. It is consistent view of Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan that where bail

granting order is perverse, arbitrary or based
on irrelevant considerations, same may well
be recalled.

10. As the bail granting order in the case
in hand was found to be perverse and in
disregard of the principles laid down for grant
of bail by this court and the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of Pakistan, same warrants interference
of this court.

11. Another aspect of the case is that
while granting bail to an accused named for
effective firing at the deceased, the learned
trial court had asked for a surety of just
Rs.1,00,000/- with two sureties each in the
like amount. While releasing an accused on
such a meager amount of surety the court
below has not also ensured presence of the
accused at trial. This court also noticed same
fact today when accused-respondent was
present at the time of arguments today at the
time of announcement of order he had slipped
away. In cases where an accused is being
released on bail, his surety bonds should be
procured from him in a reasonable amount
which is sufficient for ensuring his presence
and attendance before the trial court. In this
age of higher inflationary trends and

consistent devaluation of rupee sticking to the
10

same one hundred thousand rupees, has no
more been a sufficient amount for obtaining
security, therefore, the order of learned court
below was also bad for not obtaining sureties
in sufficient amount from the accused-
respondent prior to his release on bail.
12. In light of what has been discussed
above, this petition is allowed and _ bail
granted to accused-respondent vide order
dated 10.01.2022 passed by learned
Additional Sessions Judge-lll Mansehra_ is
recalled. Accused has left the court premises
before announcement of order, therefore,
local police shall arrest him and he shall
accordingly be remanded to judicial custody
where his custody shall further be regulated
according to order of learned trial court. Non-
bailable warrant of arrest shall be issued by
the trial court at the first instance and his
sureties will also be proceeded against
according to law. The learned trial court shall
also proceed against his sureties according to
law after due notice.

Reasons recorded herein were
aimed at disposal of the instant bail

cancellation application, which are not
11

supposed to prejudice mind of learned trial
court, at the conclusion of trial.
