LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This criminal
appeal is directed against the judgment
dated 10.12.2014 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Swabi at Lahor delivered in
case FIR No.724 dated 13.05.2012
u/ss 302/324/34 PPC of Police Station
Lahor, Swabi, whereby the appellants have
been convicted and sentenced u/s 302 (b) of
PPC to imprisonment for life. They were
ordered to pay compensation of
Rs.2,00,000/- each to the legal heirs of the
deceased within the meaning of
Section 544-A Cr.P.C or in default whereof
to further undergo six months S.l. The
appellants were also convicted u/s 324 PPC
and sentenced to five years R.I. It was also

ordered by the learned trial Court that the
sentences shall run concurrently. Benefit
u/s 382-b Cr.P.C was extended to the

appellants.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
13.05.2012, Haizar Ali (PW-3), reported to
Hanif Khan, ASI of Police Station Jehangira
(PW-8), to the effect that he, his brothers
Sahib Zar, Manzar and_ brother-in-law
Zafar Jamal were present in the field of one
Javed to protect the melon and water melon
which they had grown as sharecroppers. In
the meanwhile, the appellants came there
and _ started plucking melon who were
restrained from doing so on which they got
infuriated and left for their home but returned
thereafter duly armed and started firing at
them. According to FIR, the complainant, his
brothers and brother-in-law fled from the
field to save their skins but were chased by
the appellants and when they reached the
place of occurrence, there they were fired at
with which their brother-in-law namely, Zafar
Jamal was hit and died on the spot while

they escaped unhurt.

3. On completion of investigation, the
case was put in Court, where the appellants

were indicted for the crime to which they
pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order
to prove its case, prosecution examined 09
witnesses, whereafter statements of the
accused were recorded, wherein, they
professed their innocence. The learned trial
Court, after conclusion of the trial, found the
appellants guilty of the charges and while
recording their conviction sentenced them
as mentioned above, hence the _ instant

appeal.

4. Learned counsel for the appellants
argued that the prosecution has miserably
failed to prove its case against the
appellants through worth reliable and
confidence inspiring evidence; that the
prosecution case has been negated by
medical evidence and site plan of the case.
The learned counsel further argued that the
prosecution side has suppressed real facts
from the Court and presented such a
distorted picture of the episode, which runs
quite contrary to the circumstantial aspects

of the case.

5. As against the above, learned
counsel for the complainant assisted by the
learned AAG supported the impugned

judgment.
6. We have heard learned counsel for
the parties and with their assistance gone

through the case record.

7. Perusal of the case record would
show that the occurrence was originated in
the field of melon and culminated at a place
situated two kilometers away therefrom. Ibid
fact of the case is evident from site plan of
the case (Ex.PB). According to the site plan,
part-‘A, is the place where the appellants
had tried to pluck melon and were restrained
by the complainant’s side from doing so on
which, they left the field for their home but
came back with arms and started firing at
the complainant's side. The complainant
Haizar Ali (PW-3) and eyewitness Safdar Ali
(PW-4) both have deposed before the Court
that on return of the appellants with arms
they fled from the field to save themselves
but were chased by the appellants while
firing at them and when they reached at the
place marked part-‘B’ in the site plan, there
with the fire shots of both the appellants,
Zafar Jamal was hit and died on the spot. It
is worth to mention that, in between the two
sites, i.e. part-‘A, and part-‘B, of the site plan,

there is a distance of two kilometers.
8. Pronounced aspect of the case is that
the complainant’s side, comprising of four
persons, was chased by the appellants for
two kilometers with intermittent firing but
during this exercise of flee and chase, none
from the complainant’s side sustained any
injury till the victim side reached at part-’B’ of
the site plan where the deceased was hit.
Ibid aspect of the case is not believable in
the ordinary course of nature. Record
reveals that the occurrence had taken place
in the month of May at 12 o’clock. According
to the site plan, near to both the spots i.e.
point-‘A, and point-‘B, there are residential
houses and agricultural lands and as per the
statement of PW-4, number of farmers were
present in their respective fields at the time
of occurrence. Had there been a continuous
flee and chase, by and on behalf of the
complainant's side and the appellants
respectively, stretching over a distance of 02
kilometers coupled with intermittent firing
then certainly, there must have been an
attempt on the part of the locals to intervene
and come to the rescue of the victims which
is not only expected from the village people
but they actually do like this. Absence of the

above factor has put the prosecution case,
as reported, under heavy doubt. Moreso,
while fleeing upto two kilometers, the four
fleeing persons could have taken a refuge
somewhere for their safety as one can easily
hide himself from his assailant when chased

upto a considerable long distance.

9. When looked from the above angle, it
would appear that the occurrence did not
take place, the way same has been reported
and it looks that the eyewitnesses have
given a distorted account of the occurrence.
Another noticeable aspect of the case is that
PW-6 has produced before the Court a copy
of Roznamcha No.17 dated 13.05.2012 as
Ex.PW 6/1, according to which the police
had come to know about the cross-firing
between the two groups of the instant case.
On coming to know about the firing, PW-6
alongwith police personnel rushed to the
spot i.e. part- ‘B, of the site plan (EX.PB)
where he met complainant of the instant
case and found dead body of Zafar Jamal. It
is worth to mention that PW-6 also found a
30 bore Kalakove like rifle lying with dead
body of the deceased which he took into
possession. Presence of rifle with dead body

of the deceased not only casts serious doubt
on the prosecution story as to its accuracy
but it shows that the deceased had died ina
manner other than the one reported by the

complainant.

10. In addition, according to the case
murasila (Ex.PW A/1), the occurrence had
taken place at 12.00 hours but in cross-
examination, PW-3 i.e. the complainant, has
stated that the oral altercation forbidding the
appellants from plucking melons had taken
place at 8.00 a.m. or 10.00 a.m. PW-4 says
in his cross-examination that the occurrence
might have taken place after a lapse of 5
minutes of the oral altercation. When the
initial firing and oral altercation had taken
place at 10.05 a.m. as per the statements of
both the eyewitnesses then mentioning the
time of occurrence as 12.00 hours in the
case murasila is sufficient to falsify the story
narrated by the complainant in his report.
Furthermore, it is the prosecution’s case that
all the four persons i.e. the complainant side
were fired at by the appellants but receiving
no injury by the three persons shows their
non-presence on the spot as when four
persons are fired by two persons while

chasing from an area stretching over two
kilometers, then the possibility of receiving
injuries by all the four would be quite natural.
As neither the two eyewitnesses nor the
abandoned eyewitness have suffered a
single wound on their bodies albeit they
were chased for quite a long distance with
intermittent firing at them by the appellants,
therefore, their presence on the spot as
disclosed by them is a fact which has been

belied by circumstantial aspect of the case.

11. | Thorough and careful examination of
the case record would show that presence
of eyewitnesses on the spot is_ not
established through reliable and confidence
inspiring evidence, hence, their testimony is
not acceptable to record conviction of the
appellants for the safe administration of
justice. The prosecution has failed to prove
its case against the appellants beyond any
shadow of doubt, which is hall mark of
criminal jurisprudence. In our considered
opinion, the learned trial Court has not
appreciated the case evidence in its true
prospective and has fallen in error while
convicting the appellants for which its

judgment is not sustainable.
12. For what has been discussed above,
we accept the instant appeal, set aside the
impugned judgment of conviction and
resultantly acquit the appellants of the
charges leveled against them. They be set
free, if not required to be detained in any

other case.

13. Above are the reasons of our short

order of even date, which reads as under:

“For the reasons to be recorded
later, this appeal is allowed,
conviction and sentences of the
appellants recorded by learned
Additional Sessions Judge, Lahor
District Swabi vide the impugned
judgment dated 10.12.2014 in case
FIR No.724 dated 13.05.2012 u/ss
302/324/34 PPC of Police Station
Lahor District Swabi, are set aside.
The appellants are acquitted of the
charges leveled against them and
they be set free forthwith, if not

required or wanted in any other

case”.
