JUDGMENT

AHMAD ALI, J. Through the instant petition under Section
561-A Cr.P.C. the petitioner has approached this Court praying
that:-

“On the acceptance of _ this
quashment petition, order dated
08.11.2016 of respondent No. 2 and
the proceedings in case No. 50/2 in
the court of learned Magistrate-II,
Ghazi may kindly be quashed and
grant any other kind of relief which
this honourable court deem
appropriate. ”

2. Brief facts of the case are that respondent Mst. Hassan

Taj reported the matter to the local police that she along with
Page 2 of 7

Mst. Saeem Jan were following their cattle and at about 01:45
when they reached near the house of Mir Afzal, Mst. Gul Sanga
W/o Mir Afzal along with Shafique and Saeed were present
who intervened them and started abusing them, as a result of
which a quarrel took place in between them and Shafique and
Saeed who were armed with sticks, injured Mst. Hassan Taj and
Mst. Saeem Jan. The report was incorporated in the shape of
Daily Diary No. 14 dated 25.07.2016 and the injured were
referred for medical examination. However, in the light of
medical reports of the injured, no cognizable offence was made
out, as such the respondent filed an application under Section
22-A(vi) Cr.P.C. which was accepted by the learned Justice of
Peace vide the impugned order, hence the instant petition.
3. I have given my anxious thought to the blue streak
arguments of learned counsel for the parties and gone through
the record with their able assistance.
4. Perusal of record reveals that the learned Justice of
Peace, while deciding the application of the respondent, was
exercising his powers under Section 22-A (vi) of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 1898, which is reproduced for reference:-

“22-A. Powers of Justice of the

Peace. (1) A Justice of the Peace for

any local area shall, for the purpose of

making an arrest, have within such area

all the powers of a Police Officer
referred to in section 54 and an officer
Page 3 of 7

in-charge of a police-station referred to

in section 55.

Q)—

3)

(4)

(5)---

(6) An ex-officio justice of the peace
may issue appropriate directions
to. the police authorities
concerned on  a_ complaint

regarding-
(i) non-registration of a
criminal case;
(ii) transfer of investigation

from one police officer to
another; and
(iii) neglect, failure or excess

committed by a_ police

authority in relation to its

functions and duties.”
5. Bare perusal of the aforementioned portion of Section
22-A Cr.P.C. makes it clear that the Justice of Peace can be
approached in cases where the local police is reluctant to
register a criminal case when the matter reported constitutes a
cognizable offence, or transfer of investigation from one
investigating officer to another is required or where the police
neglects, fails or exceeds the authority vested in it. In the
instant case, there is no such allegation against the police and
the local police was justified in not registering a case because in

the light of medical report, no cognizable offence was made

out. In the circumstances, when the offence reported was non-
Page 4 of 7

cognizable, the procedure provided under Section 155 Cr.P.C.
was required to have been adopted which provides that:-

“155. Information in non-cognizable
cases.(1) When information is given to an
officer incharge of a police-station of the
commission within the limits of such station of
a non-cognizable offence, he shall enter in a
book to be kept as aforesaid the substance of
such information and refer the informant to the

Magistrate.

(2) Investigation into non-cognizable cases.
No_ police-officer shall investigate a non-
cognizable case without the order of a
Magistrate of first or second class having power
to try such case or send the same for trial to the

Court of Session.

(3) Any police-officer receiving such order
may exercise the same powers in respect of the
investigation (except the power to arrest
without warrant) as an officer incharge of a
police station may exercise in a cognizable
case.”
6. Sub-section (1) of Section 155 Cr.P.C provides that when
a non-cognizable offence is reported to the local police, the
local police is bound to enter the report in a specific register

and refer the complainant to Magistrate and only the Magistrate

is empowered to order for investigation or otherwise in the
Page 5 of 7

case, while Justice of Peace is not empowered to direct the local
police to proceed against the accused. When the police
investigate a case of non-cognizable offence without
permission of a Magistrate, such act of the police would
amount to violation of mandatory direction of law and its
continuation shall be an abuse of process of law. Reliance is
placed on “Mst. Malka Jan Vs. IGP NWFP Peshawar and 2
others (PLJ 2000 Peshawar 3), “Haij Rehman SHO and 3
others Vs. Provincial Police Officer, Government of KPK
Peshawar and 3 others” (2012 P.Cr.L.J Peshawar 1526),
Muhammad Ashigq and 2 others Vs. SHO, PS Northern Cantt.
Lahore and 3 others (2005 YLR 1879) and Muhammad
Shafiq Vs. SHo and others (2012 YLR 828)”.

7. Learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon the
judgment of august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of
“Muhammad Ali Vs. Additional I.G. Faisalabad’ reported as
“PLD 2014 SC 753” in support of his argument that the
present petition filed under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. is not
maintainable however, the larger bench of the august Supreme
Court of Pakistan, overruled its earlier view while deciding
Civil Appeals No. 1491 of 201363-L, 64-L/14, Civil Petitions
No. 1945-L/11, 933-L, 1840-L/13, 372-L, 589-L, 737-L/14,

1155-L/13 etc. by holding:-
Page 6 of 7

“The duties, the Justice of Peace
performs, are executive, administrative,
preventive and ministerial as is evident
from sub-sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of 22-
A and 22-B of the Cr.P.C. Such duties
have not been a subject matter of
controversy nor have they ever been
caviled at by anybody. Controversy
emerged with the insertion of sub-
section 6 in Section 22-A and Section
25 of the Cr.P.C. when Sessions Judges
and on nomination by them the
Additional Sessions Judges became the
Ex-officio Justice of Peace. The
functions, the Ex-officio Justice of
Peace performs, are not executive,
administrative or ministerial inasmuch
as he does not carry out, manage or
deal with things mechanically. His
functions as described in Clause (i), (ii)
and (iii) of sub-section 6 of Section 22-
A Cr.P.C., are quasi-judicial as he
entertains applications, examines the
record, hears the parties, passes orders
and issues directions with due
application of mind. Every lis before
him demands discretion and judgment.
Functions so performed cannot be
termed as executive, administrative or
ministerial on any account. We thus

don’t agree with the ratio of the
Page 7 of 7

judgments rendered in the cases of
Khizar Hayat and others Vs. Inspector
General of Police (Punjab), Lahore and
others (PLD 2005 Lhr._470) and
Muhammad_Ali_Vs._Additional_1I.G.

(PLD 2014 SC _753) inasmuch as it
holds that the functions performed by

the Ex-officio Justice of Peace are
executive, administrative or

ministerial.”

8. So in the light of above principle laid down by the apex
Court, the petition in hand under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. is
maintainable and since the procedure provided under Section
155 Cr.P.C. has not been adhered to in the instant case,
therefore, the entire proceedings carried out in continuation of
the impugned order would result into the abuse of process of
law.

9. In the light of what has been discussed above, this
petition is allowed. The impugned order dated 08.11.2016,
passed by learned Justice of Peace and entire proceedings
carried out thereupon, being alien to law, stand quashed.

Announced:
27.02.2020
