WAQAR AHMAD SETH, J:- Khalid Saleem

Marwat, hereinafter called the petitioner has invoked
the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article-199 of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973
with the prayer of issuing a writ directing the
respondents not to harass, humiliate and arrest the
petitioner and to declare the call up notice dated
12.01.2018, as illegal, void ab initio and to exonerate
him from the inquiry, so initiated by the respondents.

2. On 16.02.2018, the case was fixed before the

Court and petitioner was granted interim bail in the
sum of rupees five lacs with two sureties and comments
were called from respondents with the direction to the

petitioner to join inquiry / investigation proceedings,

Contd.

however, today, learned ADPG for NAB states that no
warrant of arrest against the petitioner has been issued
till date and only call notice in pursuance of inquiry
was issued and that petitioner will not be arrested
unless and until proper warrant of arrest is issued; and
that too would be executed at his residence. Learned
counsel for petitioner when confronted, he conceded.

3. Perusal of record suggests that respondents/NAB
authorities in pursuance to investigation against Officer
/ Officials of Settlement Department & Revenue
Department (KP) and other regarding misuse of
authority in allotment of Land through RL-II No. 167
has taken cognizance of the matter and petitioner being
Ex-DOR, Peshawar, has been issued call up notice

4, Section 19 of the NAO, 1999, whereunder

notice has been issued to petitioner authorized the

Contd.

Chairman NAB or an officer of the NAB duly
authorized by him to call for information, which is

reproduced for reference as under:-

“The Chairman NAB or an officer of the

any person is involved in or is privy to
an offence under this Ordinance, the

Contd.

Chairman NAB may, with the prior
approval in writing of the High Court
concerned, direct that surveillance of that
person may be carried out through such
Means as may be necessary in the facts
and circumstances of the case and the
chairman NAB, may in this regard seek
the aid and assistance of any Government
agency and the information so collected
May be used as evidence, in the trial
under this Ordinance;

5. It is the power and prerogative of the NAB
Chairman or for that matter an authorized officer to
call for anyone, possessing the record or having
certain information regarding inquiry / investigation,
taken cognizance by the NAB and none should

absolved their-self from such proceedings /

providing information on the plea of harassment.
6. Even otherwise, the NAB Ordinance provides
for the setting up of a National Accountability

Bureau so as to eradicate corruption and corrupt

practices and hold accountable all those persons
accused of such practices and matters ancillary
thereto. The National Accountability Bureau has also
the power to intervene where it is expedient and
necessary to provide for effective measures for the
detection, investigation, prosecution and speedy

disposal of cases involving corruption, corrupt

ee

Contd,

practices, misuse or abuse of power or authority, |
misappropriation of property, taking of kickbacks
and commissions. In the cases of Shehnaz Begum vs

The Hon'ble Judges of the High Court of Sindh and

Baluchistan and another (PLD 1971 SC677), Brig:
Imtiaz Ahmad vs Government of Pakistan through
Secretary Interior Division and two others (1994
SCMR_ 2142) Muhammad Latif ASI Police Station
Sadar, Sheikhupura vs Sharifan Bibi and another
(1998 SCMR 666) and Anwar Ahmad Khan vs The
State _(1996 SCMR_ 24), the Hon’ble apex Court
declined and even deprecated interference, when the
case is in its investigative phase. This court or for
that matter any other Court came cannot step into
stifle such proceedings which is primarily aimed to
collecting data to find out the nature of liability.
When the persons proceeded against shall have the
maximum chance to put across their point of view

before the NAB authority, it is neither fair nor legal

to interfere during its analytical phase, that too;
when there is nothing so far on the record to show
any malice or mala fide on the part of the NAB.

Therefore, we do not feel inclined to interfere with

the inquiry proceedings initiated against the
7
Contd. 6

petitioners in its initial stage.
7. For the reasons recorded hereinabove this writ
petition is disposed of in above terms. Interim order

dated 16.2.2018, is hereby recalled / withdrawn.
