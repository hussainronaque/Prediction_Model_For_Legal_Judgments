JUDGMENT

Date of hearing = 22.8.2024
Petitioner by Syed Hamid Ali Shah, Advocate

FIA by Barrister Rahat Ali Khan Nahadqi,
Assistant Attorney General, alongwith
Ms. Laila Manan, Sub Inspector,
FIA/ACC, Peshawar

Respondents 3-4 by Mr. Younas Ali Shah, Advocate

ere
IJAZ_ ANWAR, J.- The dispute between the parties
arose when respondents Nos.3 & 4, hereinafter to be
referred to as “(insured persons)” submitted a complaint
to the Prime Minister’s Performance Delivery Unit

(PMDU) Pakistan Citizen’s Portal (PCP).

2. When the above complaint was referred to FIA,
the respondent FIA registered an enquiry, numbered it as
59/2023, and issued a process in the matter, which has
now been questioned in this Constitutional petition. In

order to see as to whether the contents of the complaint
has any nexus with the criminal liability of the petitioner,
the same is reproduced in original;

“I am Muhammad Intekhab Ahmed CNIC# 11101-
6549543-1 bear 5 jubilee life insurance policies
under my and my wives names. I am writing to you
regarding unethical and unprofessional behavior of
Mr. Imtiaz Group Manager of Jubilee Life
Insurance Peshawar Office and the concerned
insurance officer Mst. Mehreen. I- The concerned
Peshawar office has been failed to deliver my
policies details. They have not given me details of
principal amount, cash values and deductions and
penalties of my policies upon frequent enquiries.

Rather they misguide and mislead us. 2- Mst.

Mehreen has surrendered my policies and imposed
undue penalties without my knowledge and consent.

3- Mst. Mehreen has repeatedly misguided me of my
policies. 4- Mr. Imtiaz has not given any ear to my
complaints and reservation instead have wasted my
time by playing delaying tactics. The details of
policies under my and my wives names are

attached. Pls provide details of principal amount,

cash value and deduction details of all.”

3. The respondents were put on notice, the learned
Assistant Attorney General who was present in the Court
accepted notice on behalf of the official respondents
Nos.1 & 2 and subsequently filed Para-wise comments
on their behalf wherein the issuance of the desired writ
was strongly resisted by raising legal and factual

objections.
3. Extensive arguments of both parties were heard
and case law referred has been thoroughly gone through
but, for the purpose of brevity, we are not reproducing
the respective arguments of counsel for the parties;
however, would refer it at an appropriate place. From the
arguments and pleading of the parties, the following two
contentious issues between the parties require
resolution:-
i) Exercise of jurisdiction by FIA in the matter

between the insurance company and its

insured persons;

ii) Whether criminal liability can be attributed
to the petitioners and instead resort can be
made to the forums available to respondents

Nos.3 & 4 for redressal of their grievance;

4. The relevant facts necessary for the decision of the
instant matter are that respondent No.3 purchased four
(04) life insurance policies from the petitioner at different
points in time after complying with necessary
requirements. Similarly, respondent No.4 also purchased
a life insurance policy. It is alleged in the writ petition
that the insured person surrendered two policies, the
relevant details pertaining to these policies are

reproduced;

Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is a life

by shares and is dealing with insurance business.

Jurisdiction:

6. The Federal Investigation Agency has been
established under The Federal Investigation Agency Act,
1974 “(the Act)”. The preamble of it being relevant is

reproduced as under;

‘ Preamble: “Whereas it is expedient to provide for
the constitution of a Federation Investigation
Agency for the investigation of certain offences
committed in connection with matters concerning
the Federal Government, and for matter connected

therewith.”

It has repeatedly been held by the Superior Courts that

the preamble is not an operative part of a Statute
>

nevertheless it does provide a useful guide for finding out
the intention of the legislature and therefore, cannot be
ignored while interpreting the law. Reference can be
made to “The Murree Brewery Co. Ltd vs. Pakistan
through the Secretary to Government of Pakistan,

Works Division and 2 others” (PLD 1972 SC 279).

8. Section 2(e) of the Act provides for the definition
of public servant and as such being relevant is reproduced
as under;

“Public servant” means a public servant as defined

in section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV

of 1860), and includes an employee of any

corporation or other body or organization set up,

controlled or administered by the Federal

Government.
While the Federal Investigation Agency can Investigate
only those offences which are given in the Schedule
attached to the Act either it should have been committed
by a public servant as defined in S. 21 PPC, or were
allegedly committed in matters pertaining to the Federal
Government or by employees of the Corporations set up,
controlled and administered by the Federal Government.

S. 3 of the Act being relevant is reproduced as under;

“Constitution of the Agency. (1) Notwithstanding

anything contained in any other law for the time
being in force, the Federal Government may
constitute an Agency to be called the Federal
Investigation Agency for inquiry into, and
investigation of the offences specified in the
schedule, including an attempt or conspiracy to

commit, and abetment of any such offence.

(2) The Agency shall consist of a Director-General
to be appointed by the Federal Government and
such number of other officers as the Federal
Government may, from time to time, appoint to be

members of the Agency.
8. Section 9 of the Act empowers the Federal
Government to make rules for carrying out the purpose
of this Act or relating to the functions of FIA including
the powers to conduct inquiries and investigations. Thus,
while exercising its powers, the Federal Government
through SRO No.567/(1)2002 dated 23.8.2002 gazette
notified on 27.8.2002 framed the Federal Investigation
Agency (Inquiries and investigations) Rules, 2002 “(the
Rules)”. Rule 3 empowers the Agency to initiate an
inquiry or investigation either on its own or on receipt of
a complaint or oral or written information. Sub-rule 2
provides that; while inquiring into the matter, no undue
publicity shall be given to it; besides, special care shall
be taken to ensure that no unnecessary damage is caused
to the prestige, reputation and dignity of any public

servant involved in the case. Similarly, under rule 4 extra

care is required for verification of the complaint, and no
action shall be taken against the public servant on any
anonymous or pseudonymous complaint. Rules 5 and 6
being relevant in the present controversy are reproduced
as under;
“5. Initiation of inquiry and registration of
criminal case. —(1) An inquiry shall be initiated
against an accused public servant specified in

Agency under the supervision of a Magistrate of the

first class. In such case, a report within twenty-four

hours shall be made to the Secretary of the Ministry
or Division concerned or the Head of the
Department concerned and immediate superior of

the public servant concerned.

(4) If on receipt of a complaint, the competent
authority decides not to initiate an inquiry or

register a case, it shall record reason thereof.”

6. Report regarding registration of case and
arrest. — The Registration of a case and
consequential arrest of a public servant shall be
reported to the Head of the Department of the

accused within twenty-four hours.
While rule 10 provides for obtaining sanction for
prosecution of public servant. It being also relevant is
reproduced for reference as well;

“10. Obtaining Sanction for prosecution.--(1)
On completion of an investigation, a case found fit
for prosecution for which sanction for prosecution
is required under section 197 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), or under
subsection (5) of section 6 of the Pakistan Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1958 (XL of 1958), or the
rules made thereunder, shall be submitted by the
Agency to the Federal Government to accord
sanction of prosecution alongwith full facts of the
case, the opinion of the Legal Officer and statement

of allegations.

(2) __Incases registered against officers working
in BPS-20 and above, explanation of the accused
officer, giving him fifteen days time shall be
obtained by the Director-General. Questions asked
and replies furnished by the concerned officer shall

invariably be incorporated in the Confidential Final
Report and shall be submitted to the Federal Anti-

Corruption Council alongwith relevant documents.

(3) In cases of officers working in BPS-19 and
below, the prosecution sanctioning authority shall
communicate full facts of the case and statement of
allegations to the Ministry or Department under
whom the public servant concerned is employed.
The Ministry or Department shall supply these
documents to the public servant concerned and give
him an opportunity to submit his reply within thirty

days of its receipt.

(4) The Ministry or Department concerned to
whom a case has been sent under sub-rule (3) shall
convey its recommendations alongwith the
statement of the public servant concerned to the
prosecution sanctioning authority within sixty days

of its receipt.

(5) The prosecution sanctioning authority shall
take into consideration the explanation of the
accused public servant while making a decision

regarding disposal of the case.

(6) If the prosecution sanctioning authority
decides to prosecute the accused public servant,
sanction for prosecution under section 197 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898),
or, as the case may be subsection (5) of section 6 of
the Pakistan Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1958
(XL of 1958), shall be given forthwith.

(7) ‘If it is decided to hold departmental
proceedings against the public servant, it shall be
held by the authority under whom the public
servant is serving. The Ministry of Interior,
Government of Pakistan or, as the case may be the

Agency, shall supply all material required for the

10

: departmental proceedings to the concerned
Ministry, Division or Department under which the

public servant concerned is employed.”
Similarly, rule 11 of the Rules provides that where more
than one public servant is involved in a case, the
competent authority for the public servant in the highest
rank shall also be the competent authority for the junior
public servant involved in the case. Thus, the very
powers of the FIA regarding investigation are duly
structured in the rules of 2002, which amply suggest that
it can only inquired and investigate certain offences
either committed in connection with the matter
concerning the Federal Government or for matters

connected therewith.

10. The arguments that in the schedule of FIA
different offences are provided including S. 406 to 409
PPC, and it suggests that even matters between private
individuals can be inquired and investigated by the FIA,
however, the august Supreme Court of Pakistan in the
case of “Director General, FIA and others vs. Kamran
Iqbal and others (2016 SCMR 447)” has not accepted

such arguments and held as under;

“8. In the present case, as noted earlier, the

dispute is between two private individuals. It is in
11

respect purely of a business transaction, and there
is not the remotest involvement of the Federal or
for that matter any Government or any
governmental entity and thus in view of the
foregoing circumstances, the FIA has had no
jurisdiction in the matter. It is now well settled that
an investigation launched beyond jurisdiction is
mala fide and without lawful authority and is liable
to be struck down.”

A division bench of the Hon’ble Lahore High Court in
the case of “Mian Hamza Shahbaz Sharif vs.
Federation of Pakistan and other (1999 P Cr. L J

1584)” has held that;

“Federal Investigation Agency could Investigate
only those cases which were given in the Schedule
attached to the Act and same were alleged to have
been committed either by a public servant as defined
in §. 21 PPC, or were allegedly committed in
connected with matters pertaining to Federal
Government or by employees of the Corporations
set up, controller and administered by the Federal

Government.”
In the case of Pakistan Engineering Company Ltd
through Managing Director and 2 others vs. Director
General, FIA Islamabad, and 3 others (2011 YLR 337),

the Hon’ble Lahore High Court has held

“(a) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)---

----S. 406---Federal Investigation Agency Act
(VIIL of 1974), Preamble & S.2(e)---
Constitution of Pakistan, Art.199---
12

Constitutional petition---Maintainability---
Criminal breach of trust---Notice for inquiry---
Petitioner Company had called in question the
legality of a notice for enquiry issued by the
Assistant Director, Federal Investigation
Agency; as well as the proceedings being
conducted thereon---Maintainability of
constitutional petition had been challenged by
respondent contending that Federal Government
having complete administrative control over the
affairs of the petitioner company, FIA had
jurisdiction to register and investigate the case
and that offence of criminal breach of trust was
made out against the petitioner company and
same was included in the Schedule of Federal
Investigation Agency Act, 1974---Validity---
Held, there being business dealings of sale and
purchase between the parties, dispute between
the parties was purely of civil nature and F.I.A.
| had got no jurisdiction to conduct an
inquiry/investigation in the matter---Impugned
notice and the proceedings conducted thereon,
were declared to be without jurisdiction and

lawful authority.”
The learned DAG while arguing the case has placed
reliance on the judgment reported as “Muhammad
Hammad ur Rehman Zafar vs. Director, FIA Lahore
and another (PLD 2022 Lahore 177) and contented that
mere notices have been issued to the petitioners and that
so far mere inquiry is to be conducted and that objecting
on such notice is premature at this stage. Such arguments

of learned DAG are vague. We are of the view that the

13

Federal Investigation Agency shall inquire and
investigate only those matters which the law has
entrusted to it and should utilize its energy in genuine
numerous matters which are pending with them and
require early disposal. Thus, for the reasons stated above,
we are of the view that the matter primarily relates
between the insured person and its insurer (petitioner). It
is pertinent to mention here that recently the august
Supreme Court of Pakistan in Oxford University Press,
Peshawar vs. Inayat-ur-Rehman and others (2021
SCMR 321) has given a somewhat different view in the
matter, however, even if we restrain ourselves from
conclusively giving any finding on the matter regarding
the extent of jurisdiction of FIA still we can safely
conclude that the complaint filed by respondents Nos.3
& 4 does not constitute a criminal offence to be

investigated/ inquired by the FIA.

11. There is yet another very important aspect of the
case; in the instant case, respondent No.3 has submitted
a complaint to the Prime Minster Delivery Unit through
Pakistan Citizen’s Portal and it was pursuant to the said
complaint that the matter was referred to the FIA for

inquiry into the matter. A division bench of this Court in

14

the case of Ziaullah Khan and 5 others vs. Government
of Pakistan through Secretary Interior and others (PLD
2022 Peshawar 122) quashed such proceedings and held
such referral to the FIA as unconstitutional and beyond
the executive authority of the Federation. Relevant Para
is reproduced as under;

(c) Constitution of Pakistan--- |

----Art. 199---Constitutional petition---Grievance
Redressal Mechanism---Good governance---Prime
Minister's Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU) and
Pakistan Citizen's Portal (PCP)---Direction to
Provincial Government---Petitioner was aggrieved

of inquiry by provincial police into complaint

received on PCP and forwarded by Federal
Government---Validity---Constitutional scheme of

distribution of powers and adherence to the same

}

was more important than redressal of grievance
through instrumentality of PMDU and PCP---Such
mechanism could only be made effective if

institutions made for the purpose were made

accountable, effective and responsive to such
complaints by none else than respective Provincial
Governments, in whose domain such departments

or organizations lied---Outside interventions in

such departments and those also in contravention
of Constitutional schemes and laws of the land
would not produce any good but would rather cause
more harm---Proceedings initiated and conducted
on the authority of Pakistan Citizen Portal
including entertaining of such complaint and
referring the same to police authorities for taking
necessary action, were unconstitutional and
beyond the Executive authority of Federation,

illegal, without lawful authority and were null and
15

void---High Court quashed the proceedings
initiated by Pakistan Citizen Portal as the same
were within the exclusive domain of Provincial
authorities and those conducted by local police
against petitioner on the direction of PCP were also
initiated without lawful authority, in an unlawful
manner---High Court declined to initiate criminal
proceedings against complainant or furnishing
information about identity and whereabouts of
complainant---Constitutional petition was allowed

accordingly.

Whether _criminal_ liability can be attributed _to the
petitioners and instead resort can be made to the forums
available to respondents Nos.3 & 4 for redressal of their

grievance;

12. We have already reproduced the complaint
submitted by respondents Nos.3 & 4 which only refers to
some alleged unethical and unprofessional behavior of
the Group Manager and it was further alleged that undue
penalties were imposed upon them without their
knowledge and consent, such grievances of respondents
Nos.3 & 4 do not constitute a cognizable offence in any
manner and is purely a matter between the insurer and
the insured person. Their rights and liabilities can be
conveniently determined under the provision of the
Insurance Ordinance, 2000 “(the Ordinance)”, which
was promulgated to regulate the business of the insurance
industry to ensure the protection of the interests of

insurance policy-holders and to promote sound

i
i

t

16

developments of the insurance industry and for matters
connected therewith and incidental thereto. The
Insurance Ordinance provides a complete mechanism for
the redressal of the grievance of the insured person.
Under S. 121 of the Ordinance, the Federal Government
has constituted a Tribunal. S. 122 of the Ordinance ibid
provides for the powers of the Tribunal to exercise its
civil jurisdiction in respect of the claim filed by policy-
holders, in response to or arising out of a policy insurance
and thus the Tribunal has all the powers of the civil court
under the CPC; besides, it has also a criminal jurisdiction
to try offences punishable under the Ordinance. Thus,
respondents Nos.3 & 4 if are of the view that the
petitioners have violated any of the terms of policy of
insurance granted to them, they can conveniently
approach the Tribunal established under S. 121 of the
Ordinance. It is pertinent to mention that appeal against
the order of the Tribunal is provided to an aggrieved
person before the High Court under S. 124 (2) of the

Ordinance.

13. Similarly, under S. 125 of the Ordinance, 2000
Insurance Ombudsman is appointed, whose main powers

and functions are provided in S. 127 of the Ordinance to
17

undertake and investigate into any allegation of mal-

administration on the part of any insurance company
while the mal-administration has been further elaborated

in S. 127(2) of the Ordinance.

14. Moreover, the Federal Government has
established Security and Exchange Commission of
Pakistan through (Act No.XLII of 1997) the Security and
Exchange Commission Act, 1997, for the beneficial
regulation of the capital markets, superintendence and
control of corporate entities and for matters connected
therewith and incidental thereto. S. 20 of this Act
provides for the powers and functions of the
Commission. Sub-section 4 sub-clause (s) of S. 20
provides for “ensuring and monitoring compliance by
insurer, insurance surveyor and insurance
intermediaries of all laws, rules and regulations
pertaining to insurance for the time being in force.”
Similarly, sub-section 6 (fa) and (g) provides for;

“2I(fa) to maintain the confidence of holders of

insurance policies by protecting the interests of

policy holders and beneficiaries of insurance

policies in all matters, including assignment of

insurance policies, nomination by policy holders,

insurable interest, surrender value of policies of life
18

insurance, and other terms and conditions of

contracts of insurance;”

(g) to take whatever action it can take, and is
necessary, in order to enforce and give effect to
‘this Act, any administered legislation] or any

other law.”
Thus, besides having numerous other functions, the
Commission is also the regulator of the business of
insurance companies. The record transpires that the
Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan had
taken up the case of the respondents Nos.3 & 4 with the
petitioners and the proceedings for the settlement
between the parties were in progress; however, at the
same time, the respondents were not agreeing to the
amount which were released to them; thus, as stated
above, if there is any genuine dispute between the parties
that could be resolved before the forums as provided
under the provisions of Insurance Ordinance, 2000 but,
under no circumstances that can be made a base for

proceedings under the penal criminal laws.

15. In order to further elaborate this issue, we may
refer to S. 156 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, which
provides penalties for default in complying with or acting
in contravention of this Ordinance. Under the above

provision, Securities and Exchange Commission of
19

Pakistan is competent to entertain a complaint of policy
holder regarding violation of the express terms of the
insurance policy or the contravention of the provision of
the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 as provided in S. 156 of
the Ordinance ibid. In the case of “State Life Insurance

Corporation of Pakistan vs. Commissioner Insurance,

SECP and another [2017 CLD 1515]” it has been held that;

“Jurisdiction of Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Securities and Exchange
Commission is competent to entertain the
complaints of the policy holders and corporation’s
arguments with respect to lack of Commission’s
jurisdiction to take cognizance of a dispute
between the insurer and the policy holder is not
tenable by virtue of section 20 (6) (fa) & (g) of
Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan
Act, 1997, which empowers the Commission to
monitor the conduct of insurers towards the
Insurance Policy holders. Insurance Ordinance,
2000, also empowers the Commission to address
the grievance of shareholder as per section 76 (4)
(5) and section 156 of Insurance Ordinance, 2000. .
Commission by virtue of the said provisions, can
also award compensation to the aggrieved party
and can impose a fine on the party at default,
respectively. Commission is competent to entertain

and decide the complaint of the policy holder.
Moreover, the Insurance Ordinance, 2000 being a special
law has to prevail over the general law. The Insurance

Ordinance has a special mechanism for dealing with
20

offences for contravention of the Insurance Ordinance, as
such, in view of the recent pronouncement of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of “Saeed
Muhammad Shah vs, Federal Investigation Agency and
others [2017 SCMR 1218] “where there was a conflict
between a special law and a general law, the former
would prevail over the latter.” Thus, we are of the view
that inquiry in this matter by FIA is uncalled for and is

liable to be quashed.

16. For the reasons stated above, the petitioner has
made out a case for indulgence of this Court under its
Constitutional Jurisdiction, as such, the letter dated
26.5.2023 of the respondent FIA is without lawful
authority and of no legal effect; and the impugned inquiry

proceedings are hereby quashed.

17. The instant writ petition is allowed in the above

terms. |
