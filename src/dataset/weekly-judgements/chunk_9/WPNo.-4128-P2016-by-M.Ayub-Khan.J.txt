MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN :-J: Yaqoob,

petitioner, seeks the constitutional jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and praying that;

“It is therefore, humbly prayed that

. gi by accepting this writ petition the

conviction and sentence of the
petitioner awarded to him by P.A

Khyber vide order
dated04.01.2013 and was
confirmed respectively by

Commissioner FCR and FATA
Tribunal —0n04.04.2014 — and
17.06.2014 under Section9 ( C )
CNSA be declared is unlawful
without jurisdiction and
accordingly the petitioner be
ordered to be released forthwith.”
2. As per writ petition, on 05.12.2012, raid was
conducted on the house of the petitioner, in which 16
kilograms heroin was recovered and FIR was registered
against the petitioner and two others. The Political Agent
Khyber Agency tried the petitioner under Section 9
CNSA 1997. Four jirga members were appointed and
issues were framed. The Jirga members obtained the
consent of the petitioner and gave their unanimous
verdict vide order dated 04.01.2013. The respondent
No.1] accepted the jirga award and convicted and
sentenced the petitioner to 14 years R.I and a fine of Rs.
600,000/- (Six lac) or in default of payment further to
undergo 03 years S.I. The appeal before Commissioner
FCR was dismissed on 04.04.2014. The revision petition
before the FATA Tribunal Peshawar was dismissed on
17.06.2014.

3 Now the petitioner has invoked the
constitutional jurisdiction of this Court through this
petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, 1973.

4. Through Notification NO.F.12(3)—98-POB,
dated 19.11.2009, the Political Agents were empowered
to try and punish the accused charged for offences under
the Control! of Narcotic Substances Act, committed

within FATA. Under the Provisions of Section 48 of the
CNS Act, the appeal from the order of the Special! Court,
constituted under the CNS Act, shall lie to the High
Court which shall be heard by a Bench of not less than
two Judges, however, once the President of Pakistan
through the above S.R.O has conferred jurisdiction on
the Political Agent and has extended the applications of
the Anti-Narcotics Force Act, 1997 and Control of
Narcotic Substances Act 1997 to FATA then, the
hierarchy setup under the FCR shall continue to exercise
its jurisdiction and authority in these cases by necessary
implications because jurisdiction of the High Court is
not extended to FATA, in view of Sub-Article (7) of
Article 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. (PLD
2013 Peshawar 23)

5. Persistent view of the matter is that the
schedule to the FCR was amended and offence under the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, was made
tribal by the authority who was competent to try the
offence under the FCR. The offence under the Control of
Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, can competently be tried
by the Political Agent and appeals/revision there against
shall lie to the same hierarchy.

6. Jurisdiction of the High Court has been ousted
in the matters of Federally Administered Tribal Areas---

Neither the High Court nor the Supreme Court might
entertain any matter pertaining to the tribal areas. The
schedule to the FCR was amended and offence under the
Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, was made
tribal by the authority who was competent to try the
offence under the FCR. While the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997, had already been extended by
virtue of S.R.O. No.1295 (1) 198, dated 16.11.1998 in
compliance with Article 247 (3) of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The offence under
the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, can
competently be tried by the Political Agent and
appeals/revision there against shall lie to the same
hierarchy. Whereas jurisdiction of the High Court has
been ousted in the matters of Federally Administered
Tribal Areas by virtue of Article 247 (7) of the
Constitution. (PLD 2014 Peshawar 186).

7. Keeping in view above this writ petition fails

and stands dismissed.
