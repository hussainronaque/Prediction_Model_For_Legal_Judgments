IJAZ ANWAR, J:- Through this writ petition,
petitioner has challenged the minutes of 280 meeting
of the Provincial Quality Control Board (PQCB),
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar held on 31.12.2015,
whereby the case has been sent for judicial trial to the
Drug Court against the petitioner. The relevant para is
reproduced:-
“All of the accused appeared and were
heard in connection with their alleged
involvement in sale of spurious &
substandard injection Grecef 500mg
IV/IM B.No.0247 Mfg: by M/s Bloom

Pharma Hattar. The accused at S. No.1
declared that the said drugs were

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
supplied by the manufacturer M/s
Bloom Pharma and he has got business
terms by showing bank transactions.
He confessed that he issued warranty
on the behalf of manufacturer due to
the fact that stock was supplied to him
by manufacturer. Now due to lack of
invoice, the actual firm is taking
advantage. It was shared with PQCB
that the firm can be made accused in
accordance to section 20,21 of the
Drugs Act, 1976, if undertaking is
obtained by the accused at S.No.1.
After threadbare discussion the Board
took the following decision.

Decision. The Drug _ Inspector
concerned to refer the case to the Drug
Court for judicial trial also add the
manufacturer as accused on the basis
of under taking from the accused at
S.No.1”.

2. The facts as alleged in the writ petition are
that the petitioner has a valid license of manufacturing
of medicines from Ministry of Health, Drug Regulatory
Authority, Government of Pakistan. Initially he was
served with a letter dated 13.1.2015, whereby it was
alleged that during inspection of Zam Zam Pharma &
Medical Store, D.I.Khan on 13.1.2015 by the Drug
Inspector some samples of Injection Grecef 500mg
IV/IM Batch 0247 manufactured by the petitioner
were taken and sent to the Drug Testing Laboratory

(DTL), the report whereof confirmed that the said

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
product is Spurious & Sub-standard. The petitioner
submitted his reply dated 31.3.2015 and explained
that since 2011, the petitioner had stopped the
manufacturing of Grecef Injection 500mg and the
name of the petitioner/company on the product is
fake, despite the explanation, case against the
petitioner was sent for judicial trial to the Drug Court.
It has further been alleged that by doing so no right of
hearing was provided to the petitioner; similarly, the
decision so taken was in violation of Rule 3(3) of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Drug Rules, 1982.

3. The respondents, on the other hand,
contended that the owners of the medical stores were
issued show-cause notices from where the Spurious &
Sub-standard Grecef 500mg injection was recovered,
they confirmed that the said injection was
manufactured M/s Bloom Pharmaceuticals (Pvt.) Ltd.
Industrial Estate, Hattar, District Haripur, therefore,
the Provincial Quality Control Board (PQCB), Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa constituted under Section 11 of the
Drug Act, 1976 in its meeting held on 31.12.2015 sent
the case for judicial trial to the Drug Court against the

present petitioner, besides others.

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
4. Arguments heard and record perused.

5. It is noted that the Provincial Drug
Inspector vide letter dated 26.3.2016, has sought
explanation of the petitioner regarding the Injection
Grecef 500mg allegedly manufactured by M/s Bloom
Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. Industrial Estate, Hattar,
which was subsequently found to be Spurious & Sub-
standard as per the report of Drug Testing Laboratory
(DTL). The petitioner had vide detailed reply dated
31.3.2015 submitted their explanation in the following
words:-

“(a) Allocation of Batch No. Serial
and style for Grecef Inj does not
match the specifications of Bloom
Pharmaceuticals (Pvt) Ltd. The batch
of Grecef Inj always starts with “GF”
capital letter, but in above said
substandard/spurious drug it starts
with “O” capital letter.

(b)Registration number of water for
Inj, (Solvent) is not mentioned in
above said product while
registration No. of solvent is always
mentioned at unit carton in our
products, even it is evident and you
can find registration No. of solvent
on the pack of Ontriax 250mg Inj
batch No.0O-319 which was also
sampled by you and is manufactured
by us.

(c)Water for Inj. Batch No.W-14001

is neither used and nor received in
our premises.

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
(d)Grecef Inj. 500mg B.No.GF-093

was the last batch which was

manufactured in 2011 & expired in

2013”.
6. We, while examining the minutes of 280%
meeting found that before sending the case for trial
against the other accused they were duly heard by the
Provincial Quality Control Board (PQCB) and when
their replies to the show-cause notices were found
unsatisfactory, thereafter cases against them are sent
for judicial trial to the Drug Court.
7. Under Section 11 (5)(b) of the Drug Act,
1976, the PQCB can recommends judicial trial against
the accused on the complaint of Provincial Drug
Inspector, however, under Section 3(3) of the NWFP
Drug Rules, 1982, the PQCB is bound to provide
opportunity of hearing to the accused before directing
the Drug Inspector to prosecute the accused. Rule 3(3)
of the NWFP Drug Rules, 1982 is reproduced:-

“The Board shall, examine carefully the

case referred to it by any Inspector

under the Act, and provide an

opportunity of hearing to the accused

to explain his position before directing

the Inspector to prosecute the
accused”.

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
8. We found that before sending the case for
judicial trial against the petitioner/manufacturer, the
provisions contained in Section 11(5) (b) of the Drug
Act, 1976 and Rule 3(3) of the KPK Drug Rules, 1982
were never adhered to. It is by now well settled that
any action adverse to the right or interest of a person
can only be taken after providing meaningful hearing.
The petitioner has thus genuine grievances that he has
been condemned unheard. After the addition of 24-A
in the General Clauses Act, it is the boundened duty
and obligation of the public functionaries to pass
impugned orders with full conscious application of
mind and not in mechanical manner and to act justly,
fairly and equitably without their being any element of
discrimination.

9. In view of the above, we are having no
other option but to allow the writ petition, set aside
the decision of the Provincial Quality Control Board
(PQCB) dated 31.12.2015 only to the extent of its
direction of sending the case for judicial trial to the
Drug Court against the petitioner and remand the
matter back to the Provincial Quality Control Board

with a direction to afford proper opportunity of hearing

WP-1036-BloomPharmacetical
to the petitioner and thereafter to proceed in
accordance with the mandate given to (PQCB) under
Section 11 of the Drug Act, 1976 read with Rule 3(3)

of the KPK Drug Rules, 1982.
