Criminal Bail
Application No.599 of 2010
 ------------------------------------------------
          ORDER WITH SIGNATURE OF THE JUDGE
 
----------------------------------------------- 
1.             
For hearing 
------------ 
23.06.2010.
 
Mr. Mohammad
Imran Advocate for the applicant. 
Mr. Abdullah
Rajput Assistant Prosecutor General Sindh.
 
Mohamamd Ather Saeed J.-
This bail application has been filed against the order of the IInd Additional
Sessions Judge, Karachi East dated 09.06.2010 in bail application No.777 of
2010 relating to FIR No.260 of 2010 registered with P.S. Shahra-e-Faisal, Karachi for offences punishable under Sections 392,34 PPC wherein the bail application of
the application was rejected.
 
2.   Brief facts
of the case as per the FIR are that the complainant had submitted that two
young boys had on 24.03.2010 at about 0115 hours on the pointation of pistol
robbed two mobile phones from him and ran away and when the police mobile
reached the place of incident they followed them and on his pointation both the
accused persons, who identified themselves as Haris and Rehan the present
applicant, were arrested and from possession of Haris one pistol alongwith two
life bullets were recovered and from the possession of the accused the two
robbed mobile phones were recovered. 
 
3.   I have
heard the learned counsel for the applicant and the learned APG Sindh. 
 
4.   The main
contention of the learned counsel for the application is that the impugned order
is against the rule of consistency because the co-accused Mohammad Haris has
been granted bail vide the order of the same trial Court dated 03.06.2010 in
Bail Application No.729 of 2010. I have perused the said order and have found
that the learned trial Court had allowed the bail application of Mohammad Haris
on the basis of an affidavit of the complainant Mohammad Afzal that he had no
objection to the grant of bail to the co-accused as he is not an actual
accused. This point was raised by the applicant before the learned trial Court
but the learned trial Court rejected it by saying that the position of the
co-accused was different as in the case of Mohammad Haris the complainant had
himself said that he is not the actual accused. 
 
5.   I have
examined both these orders in juxtaposition and find that what the learned
trial Court has not considered is that the complainant by stating that Mohammad
Haris is not the actual accused has completely vitiated the story narrated by
him in the FIR as according to him Mohammad Haris was also arrested at his
pointation and was carrying a pistol at that time. This, in my opinion, renders
the case of the applicant also as a case of further enquiry. 
 
6.   The learned
APG has not seriously opposed the grant of bail. I will, therefore, admit the
applicant to bail subject to furnishing solvent surety in the sum of
Rs.50,000.00 (rupees fifty thousand only) and P.R. bond in the like amount to
the satisfaction of the learned trial Court. 
 
7.   The
applicant is cautioned that he should cooperate with the investigating agencies
and attend all the hearings before the trial Court failing which this
concession of bail may be withdrawn. 
 
This
bail application is disposed of in the above manner.
