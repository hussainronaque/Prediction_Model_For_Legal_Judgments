JUDGMENT

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J:- Petitioners through

the instant writ petition under Article 199 of
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973, have prayed for issuance of
a writ to quash FIR No.18 dated 08.02.2017
registered under sections 496-A/34 PPC at
police station, Khuram, District Karak and
proceedings initiated under it.

2. According to the FIR, the

petitioners have been charged for enticing
the daughter-in-law of respondent No.3 with
criminal intent.

3. We have heard learned counsel for
the petitioners and learned counsel for the
respondents and have gone through the case
file.

4. Perusal of the case FIR would
show that the petitioners have been charged
for the commission of cognizable offence.
The question whether the petitioners have
any nexus with commission of the offence
or not will be well thrashed out by the
learned trial court after recording the
evidence which is proper forum for that
purpose. At this stage it is not fair to quash
the FIR which was under investigation and
was at preliminary stage. It is also to be
noted that beside availing the constitution
remedy there is also alternate remedy for the
petitioners by making application under
section 249-A or 265-K Cr.P.C. after
submission of challan or by invoking the

jurisdiction of competent court under
section 439 Cr.P.C, or by invoking
jurisdiction of High Court under section 561
Cr.P.C, if need be. Surprisingly, the
petitioners without availing the appropriate
remedies as referred hereinabove have
invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of
this court. Quashing of FIR at this stage
will bound to cause injustice/prejudice to
the case of complainant party. Under no
circumstances this court can determine
innocence or guilt of the petitioners while
exercising its constitutional jurisdiction
under Article 199 of the Constitution of
Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. All the
points raised by the learned counsel for the
petitioners need evidence for resolution
thereof which is not the function of this
court, therefore, the instant petition, being
bereft of any merit, is hereby dismissed.
Announced.
