JUDGMENT

SHAKEEL AHMAD, L.- This writ petition has been
instituted on behalf of the petitioner, seeking
issuance of direction to the respondents to accord
sanction to the claim of the petitioner for
reimbursement of his medical charges amounting
to Rs.4,00,000/- (rupees four lakh).

02. To appreciate the controversy so raised, it
is appropriate that relevant facts may be stated at
the outset. It is said that the petitioner is a Pump
Operator, who is serving in the Department of
Public Health Engineering, Khyber Division. Due to
sudden and acute heart problem, he was taken to
the nearest hospital (Rehman Medical Institute,
Hayatabad, Peshawar), in emergency, on
07.12.2019, and on the same day, his surgery was
conducted in Cardiac Emergency. He remained
admitted in the said hospital till 22.12.2019.

During his stay in the hospital, he spent
Rs.4,00,000/- (rupees four lakh) on his medical
treatment from his own pocket. After recovery,
when he submitted his claim for reimbursement of
his medical expenses before the Competent
Authority, which was sent to the Director General,
Health Services, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar
for accord of sanction and allocation of fund, but, it
was denied on the ground that, his claim is not
covered under the Government Policy. Being
aggrieved of the same, the petitioner has filed the
instant petition.

03. Pursuant to the order of this Court, the
respondents submitted their para-wise comments,
raising therein, many legal and factual objections.
04. Heard both sides and record perused.

05. It is an admitted fact that status of the
petitioner as Civil Servant is not denied. On
07.12.2019, all of a sudden, the petitioner received
heart attack, in order to save his life, he was taken
to the nearest hospital ic. Rehman Medical
Institute for treatment and emergent medical aid,
he was admitted there, and on the same day, his
Cardiac Surgery was conducted and he was
discharged from the said hospital on 22.12.2019. It

will be appropriate to reproduce the medical
certificate issued by Rehman Medical Institute, as

06. He spent Rs.4,00,000/- (rupees four lakh)
on his treatment, as is reflected from the medical
prescription, enclosed with the writ petition. His
claim for reimbursement of medical charges was
denied on the ground that his claim is not covered
under rule 4 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical
Attendance Rules, 2016. It will be advantageous to
reproduce rule 4 of the Rules ibid, as follows: -

“4, Referral---(1) If the Authorized
Medical Attendant is of opinion that
the case of a patient is of such a serious
or special nature as to require medical
attendance or treatment, as the case
may be, by another medical attendant,
he may-

(a) send the patient to the nearest
Government hospital, where in his
opinion, medical attendance or
treatment, as the case may be, is
required for the patient, or in case of
serious or life threatening conditions,
to the place in the Province or Country,
as the case may be, where such medical
attendance or treatment is available.
The referral has to be to Government
hospital in the first instance, and if not
available, then he may refer the patient
to private hospital with full
justification and with prior approval of
Director General:

Provided that the approval or
otherwise of the Director General, for
such referral, shall be communicated
within seven (07) working days of such
referral request; or

(b) request such specialist or other
medical officer, to attend upon the
patient, if the patient is unable to
travel due to illness.

(2) The Casualty Medical Officer shall
be authorized medical attendant in
serious cases, needing immediate
referral, if there is no such hospital as
mentioned in sub-rule (1), to such
hospital in the Province as may, in the
opinion of such Authorized Medical
Attendant, provide the necessary
medical attendance or treatment, as
the case may be.

(3) In any exceptional case where the
Authorized Medical Attendant is of the
opinion that the necessary medical
attendance or treatment, as the case
may be, is available only in a hospital
outside the Province, he may with the
prior approval of Director General,
refer the patient for such medical
attendance or treatment, as the case
may be, in such hospitals:

Provided that the approval or
otherwise of the Director General, for
such referral, shall be communicated
within seven (07) working days of such
referral request”.

07. It will also be beneficial to reproduce the
definition of emergency as provided under rule

2(e), as under: -
——5

“Emergency case” means and includes
road traffic accidents, myocardial
infarction, burns/scalds, blast,
poisoning, head injury or any other
medical or surgical emergency of
equivalent nature as determined by the
Authorized Medical Attendant.

08. A plain reading of Clause (a) of rule 4
reveals that under the said clause, if Authorized
Medical Attendant (as defined in clause (a) of rule
4) is of the opinion that ailment of the patient is
serious or of special nature as to require medical
attendance or treatment, as the case may be, by
another medical attendant, he may refer the
patient to Government Hospital in the first
instance, and if not available, then he may refer a
patient to private hospital by giving full
justification and with prior approval of the
Director General. In our view, this rule does not
cater the cases of acute emergency like the present
one. Petitioner has no previous history of ailment,
as per record, his cardiac shock was so sudden
that he was taken to Rehman Medical Institute,
which was the nearest hospital, where, he was
admitted in critical condition, and he was
subjected to cardiac surgery. No doubt, he was not
taken to the Government Hospital, and rightly so,
because his disease was so dangerous that he was
taken to nearest hospital for emergency treatment.

In case of emergency, like the present one, the
ah

petitioner needed emergency treatment, he cannot
be placed at the mercy of Medical Attendant,
putting him on wait for getting prior approval
from the Director General, Health for referral to a
private hospital, after going through a lengthy
departmental process, as the procedural delay in
getting prior approval, or searching for
Government Hospital may result into death or
harm to a human being, on one hand, and may
devastate the object of such relief to be granted to
the civil servant. In such a situation, the low-paid
government employee/ government servant
always spends money on his treatment from his
own pocket, and under these circumstances, ex-
post facto sanction can be accorded.

09. In our view, the Department and Director
General, Health Services, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
without taking into consideration the above aspect
of the case, rejected the claim of the petitioner,
thus, failed to appreciate the need of the
petitioner.

10. For what has been discussed hereinabove,
we hold that rejection of the claim of the petitioner
for reimbursement of his medical charges was not
justified under the attending circumstances of the

case. Consequently, this petition is admitted and
allowed. The respondents are directed to
reimburse the claimed medical charges of the
petitioner, spent by him on his medical treatment

with immediate effect. There shall be no order as

to costs.
