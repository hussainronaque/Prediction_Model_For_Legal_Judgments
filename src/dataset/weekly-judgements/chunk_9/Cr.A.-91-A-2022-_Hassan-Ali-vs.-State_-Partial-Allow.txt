2. Precisely, the facts of the present case are that on
30.12.2016 at 23.45 hours, complainant Faizan Aslam
son of Muhammad Aslam alongwith the dead body of
his minor daughter Marwa aged 3/4 years, lodged
report with local police on the rooftop of the house of
Sahib Khan son of Sumandar Khan situated at
Mohallah Tanolian Jhangi Saidan to the effect that on
that day at about 01.15 p.m., his daughter namely
Marwa went out of the house but did not come back,
therefore, they started search of her but in vain; he and
his relatives were busy in search of her and his father
lodged a report in Police Station Mirpur regarding the
missing of her daughter; when in the meanwhile, his
father, on his cell No.03449496786, received a call
from an unknown person from PTCL No.0992383640,
who told him that Marwa is in his custody and asked
him to strike a deal with him and that he will contact
him again; after that his father received another call

from mobile phone No.03175595539 and the caller

demanded Rs.500,000/- as ransom money, however, his

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
father and the said caller struck a deal of Rs.400,000/-
and they were asked to come near Frontier Medical
College; then his father and the said caller remained in
contact with each other; the caller used to change the
places for payment of the ransom amount and lastly
asked his father to come to his Mohallah Tanolian and
then he turned off his mobile phone. During this period,
his father remained in constant contact with the local
police and lateron he came to know that mobile SIM
No.03175595539 is in use of Tauseef Ahmad son of
Sahib Khan; they started search of the said Tauseef and
came to know that Tauseef is at home; so they informed
the police to this effect and the SHO of Police Station
Mirpur alongwith other police personnel rushed and
raided the house of Tauseef wherefrom Tauseef was
arrested and was enquired about Marwa; in the
meanwhile, Hassan son of Atta-ur-Rehman rang a
missed call on Mobile number of Tauseef, so police
also rushed and raided the house of the said Hassan
where Hassan was also arrested; police interrogated
both of them about Marwa who disclosed that she is
available on the rooftop of Sahib Khan’s house; both

Tauseef and Hassan, in the presence of the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
complainant, Nadeem son of Banaris Khan, Safeer
Ahmad son of Muhammad Miskeen, Ehsan son of
Muhammad Aslam, other relatives and the inhabitants
of Mohallah, jointly led the police, through upstairs, to
the rooftop of the said house and pointed out a greenish
brown colour canvas bag, placed behind a big cage,
which was opened and checked in which the dead body
of Marwa was lying having a noose of drawstring
(Azarband) around her neck as well as a white printed
cloth. No motive for the occurrence was mentioned.
The complainant charged both Tauseef and Hassan Ali
(appellants herein) for kidnapping his daughter for
ransom and committing her qatl-i-amd after torture. His
reported was jotted down in shape of Murasila Ex.PA/1
which resulted into the registration of FIR Ex.PA.

3. After the completion of investigation, the
complete challan was submitted before the court against
the appellants upon which a full-fledged trial was
conducted and on the conclusion thereof, the appellants
were initially convicted and sentenced to death etc by
the learned trial court, vide judgment and order dated
31.05.2019, however, being aggrieved of the said

judgment and order, both the appellants had filed their

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
separate appeals before this court which were allowed
and the judgment and order of the learned trial court was
set aside and the case, for want of some deficiencies in
the charge, was remanded back for reframing of the
charge and denovo trial vide order and judgment dated
29.09.2020. In the wake thereof, the learned trial court
reframed the charge against both the appellants to
which they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial and
commenced the denovo trial. Prosecution in order to
prove its case against the appellants, produced as many
as nineteen (19) witnesses including the important
statements of Faizan Aslam as PW-7, who is the
complainant of this case and narrated almost the same
fact which he recorded in his report Ex.PA/1. PW-8 is
Muhammad Aslam (grandfather of the deceased). He
narrated the facts regarding the occurrence while toeing
the complainant. PW-10 is Shakir Khan Computer
Operator. He furnished the Verisys Reports Ex.PW-
10/1 and Ex.PW-10/3 and CDR etc Ex.PW-10/2,
Ex.PW-10/4 and Ex.PW-10/6. PW-13 is Usman Ghani,
who stated that on the eventful day at 06.00 p.m.
Hassan Ali (appellant) met him on the way and told

him that they had abducted and confined Marwa Bibi

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
for ransom and will release her after receiving the
ransom, however, he took his statement lightly. PW-14
is Khurram Shahzad, who purchased a SIM and handed
over the same to Hassan Ali. PW-15 is Tahir Saleem
SI, who exhibited Madd No.17 as Ex.PW-8/1. He
further stated that he alongwith other police officials
raided the house of appellants, arrested and interrogated
them and on their pointation recovered the dead body
of the deceased from the spot and bag detailed above.
During search of appellant Tauseef, he recovered
mobile phone having SIM No.03175595539 and SIM
No.03 165834932 and copy of his ID card from pockets
of his pant; similarly, during search of appellant Hassan
Ali, he recovered Q-mobile phone having SIM
No.03 169205119 from pocket of his shirt alongwith the
bag and other articles detailed in recovery memo
Ex.PW-15/3. PW-16 is Niaz Khan ASI, who remained
present with SHO/PW-15 during the proceedings
conducted by him and accordingly stated about the
facts in line with PW-15. He stood the marginal witness
to recovery memo Ex.PW-15/3. PW-17 is Rizwan
Khan (then) SP CTD. He stated that appellants Tauseef

Ahmad and Hassan Ali were produced by the I.O. for

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
recording their confessional statements. He, after
observing legal formalities, got satisfied that appellants
are voluntarily making their statements, as such,
recorded their confessional statements. PW-18 is
Muhammad Tanveer Khan (then) SHO, Police Station
CTD, Abbottabad. He chalked out FIR Ex.PA. He also
conducted the investigation of the case and exhibited
the relevant documents during his statement as Ex.PW-
18/1 to Ex.PW-18/38 besides endorsing the documents
already exhibited and other allied investigations. PW-
19 is the transposed statement of Sahib Khan as he
passed away after recording his statement in the earlier
trial. Thereafter statements of both the appellants were
recorded under section 342 Cr.P.C before the learned
trial court, wherein they claimed innocence. However,
they neither wished to produce the defense evidence
nor desired to be examined as witness under section
340(2) Cr.PC. After hearing arguments of both the
sides, the learned trial court passed convictions and
sentences against the appellants under the relevant
sections of law as stated hereinabove, through order
and judgment dated 09.04.2022. Now feeling aggrieved

with order and judgment dated 09.04.2022 of the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
learned trial court, the appellants have preferred above-
mentioned separate Criminal Appeals for their
acquittal.

4. Arguments of the respective learned counsel for
the appellants as well as learned Assistant Advocate
General assisted by the learned counsel for complainant
were heard in considerable detail and record perused
with their able assistance.

5. It is the case of prosecution as set up by the
complainant namely Faizan Aslam, at the time of
recovery of the dead body of his minor daughter Marwa
aged about 3/4 years on the rooftop of the house of one
Sahib Khan (father of appellant Tauseef) of the same
Mohallah that on the day of occurrence at about 1.15
p.m., his daughter namely Marwa went missing and
they started search of her but could not succeed. He
alongwith his other relatives made extensive search and
in the meantime his father Muhammad Aslam (PW-8)
went to Police Station Mirpur and lodged a report vide
Madd No.17 about the missing of her daughter and it
was after lodging of the aforesaid report when in the
meanwhile, his father received a call from PTCL

No.0992383640 on his Cell No.03449496786 from an

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-10-

unknown person who told him that Marwa is in his
possession and also asked him to strike a deal with him
and for that he will contact him later, thereafter another
call was made from cell No.03175595539 and this time
he demanded Rs.500,000/- as ransom money.
Accordingly, his father and the unknown caller agreed
on Rs.400,000/- as the ransom amount and the caller
asked them to come near Frontier Medical College.
This contact between the father of the complainant and
the caller remained continued. He was changing places
for handing over of the demanded ransom amount and,
at last, directed him to come to his Mohallah namely
Mohallah Tanolian for meeting and thereafter he
switched off his mobile. In the report, it is further stated
that his father remained in constant contact with the
police and the complainant was informed by the police
that mobile phone No.03175595539 is under the use of
appellant Tauseef Ahmad and they came to know that
Tauseef is at his house, therefore, they informed the
local police upon which SHO concerned alongwith
other police personnel came, raided the house of said
Tauseef and arrested him. At this point of time, the said

Tauseef received a missed call on his phone number

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-ll-

from appellant Hassan Ali, therefore, the police also
raided the house of appellant Hassan Ali and arrested
him and both the above-mentioned appellants were
jointly investigated by the police who disclosed to the
local police that Marwa is available on the rooftop of
the house of Sahib Khan, father of appellant Tauseef
and then both of them jointly led the police party to the
rooftop of the said house in presence of the complainant
as well as in the presence of Nadeem, Safeer Ahmad,
Ehsan, other relatives of the complainant and
inhabitants of the Mohallah. Both of them pointed out a
bag placed behind a cage. On opening of the said bag,
the dead body of Marwa was lying in it and she was
having a drawstring around her neck and a cloth was
also placed on her mouth, therefore, the complainant
charged both the appellants for kidnapping his daughter
for ransom and thereafter for her murder.

6. The record of the case would reveal that though
the complainant has charged both the appellants namely
Hassan Ali and Tauseef Ahmad (appellants herein)
jointly for kidnapping his daughter for ransom and then
for her murder, however, on the available record and

evidence produced by the prosecution, the cases of both

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-12-

the appellants are distinguishable on many features,
therefore, their cases are to be taken and discussed
separately.

7. As far as the case of appellant Hassan Ali is
concerned, it is an admitted fact that none of the
prosecution witnesses has uttered a single word that
either he has seen the appellant Hassan Ali while
picking the minor or the minor in his company or
handing over the minor by appellant Hassan Ali to co-
appellant Tauseef, and thus prosecution has not brought
on record an iota of evidence to prove that it was
appellant Hassan Ali who kidnapped minor Marwa.
Similarly, it has also never been the case of the
prosecution that appellant Hassan Ali has directly
approached to the complainant party for demanding any
ransom amount as on the available record, these
allegations of demanding the ransom amount have been
levelled against the co-appellant Tauseef Ahmad as it is
the case of the complainant that his father namely
Muhammad Aslam was contacted for payment of
ransom amount from Cell/SIM No.03175595539 which
Cell was lateorn recovered from the direct possession

of co-appellant Tauseef Ahmad at the time of his arrest

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-13-

and regarding which a recovery memo Ex.PW-17/3 was
also drafted, therefore, neither the allegation of
kidnapping nor allegations of any demand of ransom by
appellant Hassan Ali from the complainant party have
ever been alleged nor established by the prosecution
through any evidence.

8. It is also relevant to mention here that even for
the murder of minor Marwa, the prosecution has not
brought on record any evidence to connect appellant
Hassan Ali with the same as though the prosecution has
relied upon the confessional statements of the
appellants made before the SP / PW-18 under section
21-H of The Anti-Terrorism Act, however, if the said
confession is taken as true and correct even then
appellant Hassan Ali has statedly brought the minor to
the house of co-appellant Tauseef and simultaneously if
the confessional statement of co-appellant Tauseef is
taken into consideration then it was he who statedly
administered three intoxicant tablets to minor Marwa.
The cause of death of minor Marwa as per Post Mortem
Report is from strangulation and suffocation, that
allegation, too, has neither been alleged by the

prosecution against appellant Hassan Ali nor the same

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-14-

finds support from the combined reading of the
confessional statements of the two appellants and
rightly so as throughout this period, deceased Marwa
remained in the exclusive possession of appellant
Tauseef, therefore, for both the sets of offences i.e. for
kidnapping and demanding the ransom amount and
thereafter for the murder of the minor, the prosecution
has not been able to prove its case against appellant
Hassan Ali.

9. It is also relevant to mention here that during the
course of arguments, the learned counsel for the
complainant party made much stress that infact both the
appellants were in close contact before and at the time
of commission of offence through texting messages to
each other which as per the stance of the complainant’s
counsel also finds support from the confessional
statements, however, though the prosecution has
produced the voice transcript/conversation transcript,
however, the timings of these messages do not tally and
commensurate with the plea of complainant party as as
per the contents of the FIR as well as Madd No.17, the
minor deceased went missing at 01.15 p.m., however,

these messages are of much earlier time and if these

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-15-

messages are taken into consideration even then they
are not sufficient to establish that appellant Hassan Ali
was having any intention of murder of the minor,
whereas to the extent of demanding of the ransom
money, as stated hereinabove, the prosecution has not
brought on record an iota of evidence that Hassan Ali
has ever contacted them or demanded the ransom
amount.

10. ‘It is also one of the distinguishing features of the
case of appellant Hassan Ali that it is the case of
prosecution that infact he brought the minor Marwa to
the house of co-appellant Tauseef and thereafter she
was murdered and then both the appellants made a joint
pointation of the dead body which is a place on the
rooftop of the house of appellant Tauseef Ahmad,
however, it does not find any support from the evidence
available on file that how appellant Hassan Ali could
know the place of placing the dead body at the rooftop
of the house of co-appellant Tauseef as it has never
been a case of prosecution that both of them have
murdered her inside the house of co-appellant Tauseef
and then they have placed the dead body at the rooftop

of the said house. Therefore, even for the recovery of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-16-

the dead body from the rooftop of the house of
appellant Tauseef, appellant Hassan Ali could not be
saddled and more particularly when it is an admitted
position that it is a residential house where father,
mother and other siblings of appellant Tauseef are
residing and it is also an admitted fact that both the
appellants are not relatives then how appellant Hassan
Ali would have any access to the rooftop of co-
appellant Tauseef Ahmad, therefore, it is beyond
imagination that appellant Hassan Ali had the
knowledge of placing the dead body at the rooftop of
the house of co-appellant Tauseef.

11. Another important aspect of the matter which
not only distinguishes the case of appellant Hassan Ali
from co-appellant Tauseef Ahmad but also excludes
the involvement of the former in the occurrence as the
prosecution has failed to produce any witness to
furnish any convincing last seen evidence against
appellant Hassan Ali that he was seen either inside, or
near and around the house of co-appellant Tauseef or
in his company before or after the occurrence or in the
company of minor Marwa on the day of occurrence
despite the fact that allegedly she left her house in

broad daylight. Though prosecution produced one

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-17-

Usman Ghani (PW-13) for furnishing the alleged last
seen evidence against appellant Hassan Ali, however,
his testimony is merely hearsay basing on the
statement of appellant Hassan Ali and, that too,
without uttering a single word that he saw appellant
Hassan Ali in the company of Marwa on the day of
occurrence or near the house of co-appellant or in his
company. Besides that, how involvement of Hassan
Ali in the occurrence could be inferred when
admittedly he was not arrested from the spot of
recovery of dead body rather undeniably from his own
house. This scenario not only indicates that important
links in the chain of story set by the prosecution against
appellant Hassan Ali are missing but the same also
creates a reasonable doubt in a prudent mind regarding
the role attributed to appellant Hassan Ali in the
commission of alleged offence and thus in view of
above reasons, the case of prosecution is doubtful all
around qua the involvement of appellant Hassan Ali in
the commission of offences, therefore, he is entitled for
its benefits and consequently, he is acquitted of the
charges levelled against him under section 365-A PPC

as well as section 302(b) PPC.

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-18-

12. It is also an admitted fact that the dead body of
deceased Marwa and her belongings were recovered
from the rooftop of the house of appellant Tauseef, who
himself has concealed the same there. It is also an
admitted fact that the said house is residential and
dwelling house where four other persons are also
residing and it is also an admitted fact that appellant
Hassan Ali is not a relative of co-appellant Tauseef
who has access to enter the house of appellant Tauseef,
therefore, any allegation of concealment of the dead
body of deceased or her belongings by appellant
Hassan Ali is a remote phenomenon, therefore, he is
also acquitted of the charges levelled against him under
section 203 PPC.

13. It is settled since long that for giving benefit to
an accused, it is not essential that there should be many
grounds for the same, even a single doubt is sufficient
to extend its benefit to an accused person as it is the
cardinal principle of criminal administration of justice
that let hundred guilty persons be acquitted but one
innocent person should not be convicted. In the case of
“Bashir Muhammd Khan vs. The State” reported as

2022 SCMR 986, the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-19-

single circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of accused makes him
entitled to its benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The conviction must
be based on unimpeachable; trustworthy and reliable
evidence. Any doubt arising in prosecution's case is to
be resolved in favour of the accused and burden of
proof is always on prosecution to prove its case beyond
reasonable shadow of doubt. Likewise, in the case titled
“The State through P.G. Sindhand others vs. Ahmed
Omar Sheikh and others” reported as 2021 SCMR
873, the Apex Court has held that even if a single
circumstance creates reasonable doubt in a prudent
mind regarding guilt of an accused then the accused
shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace
and concession but as a matter of right and such benefit
must be extended to the accused person(s) by the
Courts without any reservation. The same rational has
been reiterated in cases of “Khalid Mehmood _ alias
Khaloo vs. The State” reported as 2022 SCMR 1148,
“Muhammad Mansha vs. The State” reported as 2018
SCMR 772, “Tariq Pervaiz vs. The State” reported as

1995 SCMR 1345.

Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-20-

14. As far as the convictions of appellant Hassan Ali
under section 7(e) and 7(a) of The Anti-Terrorism Act
is concerned, since we have disbelieved the evidence of
prosecution qua his involvement for offences of
kidnapping and demanding of ransom amount from the
prosecution and, thereafter, his involvement in the
murder of Marwa, as it has never been the case of
prosecution that he through his cell has contacted them
for demanding a ransom amount nor the prosecution
has produced any evidence that deceased Marwa was
seen in his company or that he handed over Marwa to
appellant Tauseef or that he has seen by any of
prosecution witness(es) entering the house of the co-
appellant Tauseef or near and around the house of the
appellant, or that he has joined hands with co-appellant
Tauseef in the murder and then concealing his dead
body, therefore, when the prosecution has not been able
to prove the substantive offences of kidnapping and
then demanding of ransom as well as of murder of the
deceased Marwa as against appellant Hassan Ali then
he could also be not convicted and sentenced under
sections 7(a) and 7(e) of The Anti-Terrorism Act as for
maintaining these convictions prosecution were

required to prove that the substantive offences of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-21-

kidnapping and murder were committed with such a
design and mode and manner so that the same may
attract the essential ingredients to constitute the offence
of terrorism and since we have held that the prosecution
has not been able to prove their case against appellant
Hassan Ali qua his involvement in the kidnapping and
murder of deceased Marwa then the mode and manner
of the commission of these offence become irrelevant
to his extent, therefore, he is also acquitted of the
charges levelled against him under section 7(a) and 7(e)
of The Anti-Terrorism Act.

15. As far as the case of appellant Tauseef Ahmad is
concerned, it is the case of prosecution that the
grandfather of minor Marwa namely Muhammad
Aslam (PW-8) received a _ call from Cell
No.03175595539 who was demanding the ransom
amount for the release of Marwa and it was the said
cell/SIM from whom the caller remained in contact
with the grandfather of Marwa and then the caller kept
changing the places for payment of the ransom amount
and then at the time of raid conducted by the local
police on the house of appellant Tauseef, a mobile set
having the same SIM number was recovered from his

possession, therefore, the prosecution has been able to

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-22-

prove their initial stance as set up in the First
Information Report qua the contact from a particular
number which was lateron recovered from the direct
possession of appellant Tauseef.

16. Another distinguishing feature of the case of
appellant Tauseef from the case of co-appellant Hassan
Ali is that it is the case of prosecution as well as the
stance of the appellants in their confessional statements
that Marwa was handed over to Tauseef in a healthy
and sound condition and it was he who lateron
administered intoxicant tablets to her inside his house
and then it was he in whose custody Marwa met his
unnatural death and then it was his house where the
dead body was concealed and which was lateron
recovered from the rooftop his house, therefore, in the
given facts and circumstances, both sets of allegations
i.e. demanding ransom for kidnapping and murder are
established on the face of record against appellant
Tauseef.

17. It is also relevant to mention here that the father
of appellant Tauseef namely Sahib Khan appeared in
the court as PW-8 (transposed as PW-19), however,

during his examination-in-chief, he stated that the dead

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-23 -

body was recovered on the pointation of appellant
Hassan Ali only and thereby exonerated his son
Tauseef Ahmad from the allegations and thus he was
declared as hostile witness, therefore, both the
prosecution and defence have cross-examined him. The
plain reading of his statement would show that he has
apparently extended concession to his son and has tried
to implicate appellant Hassan Ali but this stance is
neither reasonable nor logical nor appealable nor the
same finds any support from the attending
circumstances of the case as as stated hereinabove that
the dead body was recovered from a residential and
dwelling house where several persons including parents
and siblings of appellant Tauseef were residing then
how it was possible for appellant Hassan Ali to come to
their house and place the dead body at the rooftop of
their house, therefore, it is established that the whole
chain of the alleged offences comprising of demanding
a ransom amount and thereafter murdering the kidnapee
has been executed by appellant Tauseef Ahmad from
inside his house. It is also settled law that the evidence
produced by a hostile witness could not be outrightly

rejected and it is to be read in juxtaposition with the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-24-

other material and evidence available on file. In the
case titled “Niaz Ahmad vs. The State” reported as
PLD 2003 Supreme Court 635, wherein it has been
observed by the Apex Court that the law is clear that
the statement of a hostile witness to be viewed in the
light of the circumstances of the case and thereafter it is
to be ascertained as to what truth actually flows from
their statement, whether favouring the prosecution or
the defence.

18. As far as contention of the learned counsel for
appellant Tauseef qua the non-preparation of the
separate recovery memo of the dead body of deceased
which omission is sufficient to create doubt in the
prosecution case is concerned, suffice it to say that the
very initial report in the form of Murasila Ex.PA/1 was
lodged in the house of appellant Tauseef Ahmad at the
time of recovery of the dead body, which fact is duly
reflected in the contents of FIR and when neither this
fact of recovery of the dead body from the house of
appellant Tauseef has been denied by him nor he has
asserted that the dead body was recovered from some
other place, rather in written arguments submitted by

his learned counsel, it was contended that the said

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-25-

house was not in exclusive possession of appellant
Tauseef as three other persons were also residing there,
meaning thereby that the recovery of the dead body has
been admitted from the house where appellant Tauseef
Ahmed is also residing.

19. It is also very astonishing that on one hand, it
was asserted by the learned counsel for appellant
Tauseef that the real culprits were Khurram Shahzad
and Ijaz Shah, but on the other hand, the aforesaid three
inhabitants of the said house besides appellant Tauseef
have neither been named nor attributed any role nor any
reason has been advanced or established to the effect
that it was either Khurram Shahzad or Ejaz Shah who
had brought the dead body to their house. It is also
relevant to mention here that substitution of real
culprits with innocent persons by the real father of a
minor daughter is a rare and remote phenomenon,
therefore, these contentions are of no avail to appellant
Tauseef Ahmad. In the case titled “Shamsher Ahmad
and another vs. The State_and others” reported as
2022 SCMR 1931, in which it has been held that
substitution in such like cases is a rare phenomenon.

The complainant would not prefer to spare the real

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-26 -

culprit who murdered his son and falsely involve the
petitioner without any rhyme and reason.

20. In view of above discussions and on the basis of
available record, the role of both the appellants in the
context of two sets of allegations are quite
distinguishable from each other and this court has come
to the conclusion that it is appellant Tauseef Ahmad
who is guilty of the commission of these offences. It is
vital to mention here that by now it has become an
established principle that in criminal cases courts are
required to sift grain from the chaff in order to reach at
a just conclusion. In the case titled “Munir Ahmad and
another v. The State and others” reported as 2019
SCMR 79, it has been held that for dispensation of
justice in criminal cases courts are required to sift grain
from the chaff in order to reach at a just conclusion. If
some independent and strong corroboration is available
the set of witnesses which has been disbelieved to the
extent of acquitted co-accused of the appellant can be
believed to the extent of the appellant. Likewise, in the
case titled “Sarfraz alias Sappi and 2 others vs. The
State”, reported as 2000 SCMR 1758, it has been held

that originally the opinion of the Court was that if a

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-27-

witness is not coming out with a whole truth his
evidence is liable to be discarded as a whole meaning
thereby that his evidence cannot be used either for
convicting accused or acquitting some of them facing
trial in the same case, however, for safe administration
of justice a condition has been imposed namely that the
evidence which is going to be believed to be true must
get independent corroboration on material particulars
meaning thereby that to find out credible evidence
principle of appreciation of evidence i.e. sifting chaff
out of grain was introduced. Same view was not only
adopted in the case “Ziaullah vs. The State”, reported

as 1993 SCMR 155, but has also been reiterated in the

case tilted “Khadim Hussain vs. The State”, reported
as 2010 SCMR 1090. In view of the above discussion,
the prosecution through the ocular account of PW-7
Faizan Aslam and PW-8 Muhammad Aslam and
unbroken circumstantial evidence have proved their
case against appellant Tauseef and as such he has
rightly been convicted.

21. However, the next question which is to be
answered by this court that as to whether, on the

available evidence, appellant Tauseef is liable for the

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 28 -

capital punishment or the same requires to be reduced.
In order to determine the quantum of punishment in the
case of appellant Tauseef, it is relevant to mention here
that at the time of arrest of appellant Touseef, his age was
recorded by the local police as 18/19 years, whereas his
age at the time of recording his statement under section
342 Cr.PC was recorded as 19/20 years, therefore, prima
facie, it appears that if at the time of occurrence, he was
not a juvenile but was surely at the borderline of ages
between juvenility and majority. Similarly, while
awarding the capital punishment to appellant Touseef, the
learned trial court has heavily relied on his confessional
statement recorded by SP CTD/PW-17 under section 21-
H of The Anti-Terrorism Act. It may be mentioned here
that under normal circumstances, a confession made
before the police personnel is not admissible under
Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, however,
the same has been made conditionally admissible under
section 21-H of The Anti-Terrorism Act to the effect that
the confession so made must find independent
corroboration from other circumstances of the case.
Though the confession of appellant Touseef finds support

from other circumstances in the form of his continuous

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-29 -

contact with Muhammad Aslam/PW-8 for demanding of
the ransom amount and recovery of dead body of the
deceased from his house, however, after the recording of
aforesaid confession, the SP CTD/PW-17 again handed
him over to the Investigating Officer and who on the next
day again produced him before the Judicial Magistrate for
recording of his confessional statement, however,
appellant Touseef refused to record the same, therefore,
in such state of affairs, the confessional statement so
recorded by SP CTD/PW-17 appears to be not voluntary
more particularly when the same has been recorded by
him after 29 days of police custody. It is also relevant to
mention here that though the evidence produced by the
police could not be underestimated as they are as good
witnesses as any other witness is, however, in the present
case, though the prosecution has cited two private persons
namely Muhammad Asad son of Muhammad Akram and
Naseer Ahmad son of Muhammad Miskeen over the
recovery memo Ex.PW-15/3 vide which the dead body of
the deceased was recovered, however, those private
witnesses were not produced and thus all these
circumstances could be considered for reduction of his

capital punishment into that of imprisonment for life.

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-30-

22 ~~ In view of the above discussions, this court has
come to the conclusion that as like the concept of
benefit of doubt for considering the question of guilt or
otherwise, the court of law could also consider any
mitigating circumstance(s) for awarding lesser penalty
keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case.
The aforesaid principle of appreciating of evidence qua
considering the mitigating circumstances for the
purpose of reduction in capital punishment was applied
by the Apex Court in the case titled “Mir Muhammad
alias Miro vs. The State” reported as 2009 SCMR 1188
where the Apex Court converted the death sentence
awarded to the accused into that of life imprisonment.
Similarly, in the case titled “Mir Muhammad _ alias
Miro vs. The State” reported as 2007 SCMR 1413, it
has been observed by the Apex Court that normally
penalty for an act of commission of Qatl-i-Amd
provided under the law is death, but since life
imprisonment also being a legal sentence for such
offence must be kept in mind wherever the facts and
circumstances warrant mitigation of sentence, because
no hard and fast rule can be applied in each and every

case. Similarly, in case titled “Abdul Qayyum vs. The

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-31-

State” reported as 2003 PCr.LJ_ 1059, the Honourable
Lahore High Court while maintaining conviction has
reduced the sentence of death into that imprisonment
for life on the ground of age. In view of the above
discussion and for mitigating circumstances as
highlighted in the preceding Paras of this judgment, the
sentences of appellant Tauseef awarded to him under
section 302(b) PPC as well as under section 365-A PPC
are reduced from that of death to the imprisonment for
life on the two counts.

23. The next question before this court is that as to
whether appellant Tauseef has rightly been convicted
and sentenced to death under sections 7(a) and 7(e) of
The Anti-Terrorism Act and as to whether he has
committed these offences with the required design,
intention and mode and manner which may attract the
definition of terrorism as worded in section 6 of The
Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. As stated in the preceding
Paras of this judgment that to the extent of appellant
Hassan Ali, prosecution has not been able to prove the
commission of both sets of offences i.e. kidnapping for

ransom and murder of Marwa, however, to the extent of

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-32-

Toseef, it would be relevant to reproduce section 7(a)
and 7(e) of The Anti-Terrorism Act as under:

7. Punishment for acts of terrorism.- [(1)]
Whoever commits an act of terrorism under
section 6, whereby-

(a) death of any person is caused, shall be
punishable, on conviction, with death or with
imprisonment for life, and with fine; or

(b) ....

(c) ....

(d) ....

(e) the offence of kidnapping for ransom or
hostage-taking has been committed, shall be
punishable, on conviction, with death or
imprisonment for life.

The aforesaid both the provisions of law i.e.
section 7(a) and section 7(e) under which appellant
Tauseef was convicted and sentenced to death would
show that he has been convicted for causing the death
of Marwa as well as for the offence of kidnapping for
ransom and both these sections of law i.e. sections 7(a)
and 7(e) of The Anti-Terrorism Act are punishable with
death or imprisonment for life and conversely the
offence of qatl-i-amd under section 302(b) PPC and the
offence of kidnapping under section 365-A PPC are
also punishable with death or imprisonment for life,
however, in order to maintain the conviction under the
Anti-Terrorism Act, prosecution was bound to prove

that the appellant Tauseef has committed these offences

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 33-

in such a mode and manner which may attract the
definition of terrorism as provided under section 6 of
The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The said definition of
terrorism being relevant is also reproduced hereunder:

6. Terrorism.-(1) In this Act, “terrorism”
means the use or threat of action where:-

(a) the action falls within the meaning of
sub-section (2);

(b) the use _or threat is designed to coerce
and intimidate or overawe the Government
or the public or a section of the public or
community or sect [or a foreign government
or population or an __ international
organization] or create_a sense of fear or
insecurity in society; or

(c)...

(2) An “action” shall fall within the meaning
of sub-section (1), if it:-

(a) involves the doing of anything that
causes death;

(b) ....

(c)...

(d) ...

(e) involves kidnapping for ransom,
hostage-taking or hijacking.

The aforesaid definition of “Terrorism” would
show that the offender while committing an offence of
terrorism must have acted and with such a design so as
to create a sense of fear and insecurity amongst the
public/society. The phrase “use or threat is designed to
coerce and intimidate or overawe the public or a
section of the public or community or sect or create a

sense of fear or insecurity in society” is of more

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-34-

significance in the definition of “terrorism”. It
manifestly indicates that the offences punishable under
The Anti-Terrorism Act must be committed in such a
mode and manner and with such a clear intention of the
offender and with the sole object to create a sense of
fear and insecurity in the society and thus the attending
circumstances and mode and manner of the occurrence
are to be considered so to attract and apply the
provisions of The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. If the
aforesaid yardstick is applied to the case of appellant
Tauseef Ahmad then it is established on the face of
record that he has committed both the offences behind
the closed doors of his house as he has detained the
kidnapee inside his house and the dead body was also
concealed and kept on the rooftop of the house, which
conduct on the part of the appellant Tauseef, prima
facie, shows that his intention was not to create any
fear or terror in the society but the offence was
committed only to gain money, therefore, such conduct
on the part of appellant Tauseef Ahmad would take his
case out of the definition of terrorism and thus, he
could not be convicted under sections 7(a) and 7(e) of

The Anti-Terrorism Act. It is relevant to mention here

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-35-

that in the recent past when different courts of law
applied different yardsticks while dealing with the
cases of terrorism qua the extent and scope of offence
of terrorism then the Apex Court, keeping in view the
divergent approaches of the courts of law, constituted a
larger bench comprising of seven Honourable Judges
of the Apex Court and heard a case titled “Ghulam
Hussain and _ others vs. The State and_ others”,
reported as PLD 2020 Supreme Court 61, where it was
specifically held that mere heinousness of offence does
not constitute the offence of terrorism, however, such
offences are being made triable by the Anti-Terrorism
Court only as they were included in Third Schedule of
The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, therefore, while dealing
with such offences which are though included in Third
Schedule but when the elements to constitute the
offence of terrorism are missing then the Anti-
Terrorism Court has just to award punishment for those
heinous offences which are find mention in the
Schedule and could not pass any punishment under The
Anti-Terrorism Act. The larger bench of the Apex
Court has also observed that the definition as contained

in section 6 of The Anti-Terrorism Act is too wide and

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 36-

the legislature has included many actions, designs and
purposes which have no nexus with the generally
recognized concept of terrorism. Para No.13 of the said
judgment being relevant is reproduced below:

“A careful reading of the Third Schedule
shows that an Anti-Terrorism Court has been
conferred jurisdiction not only to try all those
offences which attract the definition of
terrorism provided by the Act but also some
other specified cases involving heinous
offences which do not fall in the said
definition of terrorism. For such latter
category of cases it was provided that
although those offences may not constitute
terrorism yet such offences may be tried by
an Anti-Terrorism Court for speedy trial of
such heinous offences. This distinction
between cases of terrorism and cases of
specified heinous offences not amounting to
terrorism but triable by an Anti-Terrorism
Court has already been recognized by this
Court in the cases of Farooq Ahmed v. State
and another (2020 SCMR 78), Amjad Ali and
others v. The State (PLD 2017 SC 661) and
Muhammad Bilal v. The State and others
(2019 SCMR 1362). It has been clarified by
this Court in those cases that such specified
heinous offences are only to be tried by an
Anti-Terrorism Court and that court can
punish the person committing such specified
heinous offences only for commission of
those offences and not for committing
terrorism because such offences do not
constitute terrorism. For the purposes of
further clarity on this issue it is explained for
the benefit of all concerned that the cases of
the offences specified in entry No. 4 of the
Third Schedule to the Anti-Terrorism Act,
1997 are cases of those heinous offences
which do not per se constitute the offence of
terrorism but such cases are to be tried by an

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-37-

Anti-Terrorism Court because of their
inclusion in the Third Schedule. It is also
clarified that in such cases of heinous
offences mentioned in entry No. 4 of the said
Schedule an Anti-Terrorism Court can pass a
punishment for the said offence and not for
committing the offence of terrorism. It may
be pertinent to mention here that the offence
of abduction or kidnapping for ransom under
section 365-A, P.P.C. is included in entry No.
4 of the Third Schedule and kidnapping for
ransom is also one of the actions specified in
section 7(e) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Abduction or kidnapping for ransom is a
heinous offence but the scheme of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 shows that an ordinary
case of abduction or kidnapping for ransom
under section 365-A, P.P.C. is merely triable
by an Anti-Terrorism Court but if kidnapping
for ransom is committed with the design or
purpose mentioned in clauses (b) or (c) of
subsection (1) of section 6 of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 then such offence
amounts to terrorism attracting section 7(e) of
that Act. In the former case the convicted
person is to be convicted and sentenced only
for the offence under section 365-A, P.P.C.
whereas in the latter case the convicted
person is to be convicted both for the offence
under section 365-A, P.P.C. as well as for the
offence under section 7(e) of the Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997. The same may also be
said about the other offences mentioned in
entry No. 4 of the Third Schedule to the Act
pertaining to "Use of firearms or explosives
by any device, including bomb blast in a
mosque, imambargah, church, temple or any
other place of worship, whether or not any
hurt or damage is caused thereby", "Firing or
use of explosive by any device, including
bomb blast in the court premises", "Hurt
caused by corrosive substance or attempt to
cause hurt by means of a corrosive substance"
and "Unlawful possession of an explosive
substance or abetment for such an offence

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 38 -

under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 (VI
of 1908)". Such distinction between cases of
terrorism and other heinous offences by itself
explains and recognizes that all heinous
offences, howsoever serious, grave, brutal,
gruesome, macabre or shocking, do not ipso
facto constitute terrorism which is a species
apart. Through an amendment of the Third
Schedule any heinous offence not constituting
terrorism may be added to the list of offences
which may be tried by an Anti-Terrorism
Court and it was in this context that the
Preamble to the Act had mentioned "Whereas
it is expedient to provide for the prevention of
terrorism, sectarian violence and for speedy
trial of heinous offences.”

Again the aforesaid legal proposition was
confirmed by the Apex Court in a recent case titled
“Nawab Siraj Ali and others vs. The State through
A.G. Sindh” reported as 2023 SCMR 16 where it was
also observed that a bare reading of the Anti-Terrorism
Act reveals that an Anti-Terrorism Court has been
conferred jurisdiction not only to try all those offences
which attract the definition of ‘terrorism’ provided by
the Act but also some other cases, which have been
specified in Third Schedule of the Act involving
heinous offences which do not fall in the said
definition of terrorism. The sole purpose of trying such

offences by the Anti-Terrorism Court is for speedy trial

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 39 -

of such heinous offences irrespective of the fact that
they do not fall within the ambit of 'terrorism’.

24. By applying the above stated yardstick as
interpreted by the Apex Court, though the offences
committed by appellant Tauseef were heinous in nature
being kidnapping for ransom and murder, however, the
mode and manner in which these offences were
committed do not attract the definition of terrorism as
the same lacks the required intention, purpose and
design of the appellant which may create a sense of
fear and insecurity in the society, therefore, he has
wrongly been convicted under sections 7(a) and 7(e) of
The Anti-Terrorism Act. As such, he is acquitted of the
charges of terrorism.

25. As far as the conviction of appellant Tauseef
under section 203 PPC is concerned, as discussed
hereinabove that it was appellant Tauseef who detained
the abductee in his house, called the relatives of the
abductee and thereafter caused her murder and then
concealed the dead body of the deceased as well as all
of her belongings at the rooftop of his house, therefore,
he has rightly been convicted and sentenced under this

head and as such the same is maintained.

(Jamil) (DB) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel,
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

26. In view of the above discussions and expositions
of law on the subject, criminal appeal No.91-A/2022
filed by appellant Hassan Ali is hereby allowed and his
convictions and sentences recorded by the learned trial
court vide impugned order and judgment dated
09.04.2022 are set aside and he is acquitted of all the
charges levelled against him and he be set at liberty
from the jail forthwith if not required in any other case;
whereas, Criminal Appeal No.94-A/2022 filed by
appellant Tauseef is hereby partially allowed and the
convictions awarded to him under section 302(b) and
section 365-A PPC by the learned trial court vide order
and judgment dated 09.04.2022 are maintained,
however, his sentences are reduced from death on two
counts to the imprisonment for life on two counts (the
former as Ta’zir). Whereas, convictions and sentences
of death on two counts awarded to him under sections
7(a) and 7(e) of The Anti-Terrorism Act are set aside
and he is acquitted of the charges of terrorism. The rest
of the judgment of the learned trial court to his extent
qua the payment of compensation amount of
Rs.10,00,000/- to the legal heirs of deceased under

section 544-A Cr.PC and conviction and sentence

recorded under section 203 PPC shall remain intact.
All the sentences of imprisonment awarded to
appellant Tauseef shall run concurrently and the
benefit of section 382-B Cr.PC is also extended to him.
Since we have acquitted one of the appellants and has
reduced the sentences of second appellant from death
to imprisonment for life on two counts, therefore,
Murder Reference No.02-A/2022 sent by the trial court
