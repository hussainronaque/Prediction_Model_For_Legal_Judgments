SAHIBZADA ASADULLAH, J.- After having been booked
in case F..R No. 74 dated 16.05.2020 under sections 302/324/34
P.P.C. the petitioner after his arrest applied for bail before the
Court of Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Lakki Marwat, which was
declined vide order dated 09.07.2020. Feeling aggrieved the
petitioner preferred this petition for his release on bail.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the complainant in
injured condition alongwith the dead-body of the deceased
Shahidullah came to the Police Station and reported the matter,
that it was at Qaza Vela, when the deceased Shahidullah received

firearm injury and he was taken for treatment to Civil Hospital
Tajori and it was after the injured got treatment that they left for
their home in a motorcar and got down from the same near the
baitak of one Khushdil, wherefrom they proceeded on foot
towards their home, it was at 01.00 a.m (mid night) when they
reached near the house of Mir Hakim, accused Noorzali Khan,
Khan Wali sons of Muhammad Khan and Sabz Ali Son of Khan
Wali were seen duly armed with Kalashnikovs, while crossing
accused Sabz Ali all the three fired at them with their respective
weapons, which resulted into injuries on his as well as on the
person of deceased Shahidullah, they fell to the ground. After a
while Shahidullah succumbed to the injuries, whereas the accused
decamped from the spot. The motive was stated to be landed
property dispute.

3. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith Asst:
Advocate General were heard at length and with their valuable
assistance, the record was gone through.

4. The record reveals that as per statement of the
complainant the incident occurred at 01.00 a.m (mid night) when he
alongwith the deceased were coming from the hospital after getting
treatment and in that respect case F.I.R No. 73 dated 15.05.2020

under section 324/34 P.P.C against Noorzali Khan, Khan Wali sons
of Muhammad Khan was registered, with the time of occurrence
mentioned as 18.00 hours. It is pertinent to mention that on the same
day i.e. 15.05.2020 at 20.30 hours the petitioner Noorzali received
injuries for which Ghani Gul son of Zafar Khan, Zahidullah son of
Mohibullah were charged, in which respect case F.I.R No. 75, dated
16.05.2020 under section 324/34 P.P.C was registered, where the
report was made at 04.15 a.m, on 16.05.2020 in the emergency ward
of civil hospital Naurang by the petitioner Noorzali. There is no
denial to the fact that the incident occurred at 01.00 a.m (mid night)
and the complainant did not mention the source of identification,
rather it was after some days of the occurrence that the Investigating
Officer recorded his 161 Cr.P.C statement where he introduced the
torch as a source of identification. The complainant was examined
by the doctor at 01.30 a.m. and prepared his medico-legal report and
also on examination found his blood pressure normal, but
surprisingly, the F.LR was registered at 04.00 a.m. when the
complainant alongwith the deceased reached to the Police Station
which is lying opposite to the hospital across the road. This is
surprising that despite the fact he was oriented in time and space the
police present in the Emergency Room of the hospital did not pen

down the report as in every civil hospital reporting centers are
provided and even no police official from the Police Station visited
the hospital to record the statement of the complainant. This is again
surprising that how and wherefrom both the injured and the deceased
were brought to the Police Station when the complainant was
already hospitalized, these are the elements which can better be
determined by the trial Court after recording pro and contra
evidence, however, it tilts the balance in favour of the accused at this
stage. True that while hearing bail application tentative assessment
is to be made and deeper appreciation is not warranted, but equally
true that bail applications cannot be heard and decided in vacuum
rather the Court which is seized of a bail matter can take into

consideration the available material before it. As is held in case titled

“Zaigham Ashraf Vs the State and others’ (2016 SCMR 18).

“9, To curtail the liberty of a person is a serious
step in law, therefore, the Judges shall apply
judicial mind with deep thought for reaching at
a fair and proper conclusion albeit tentatively
however, this exercise shall not to be carried
out in vacuum or in a flimsy and casual
manner as that will defeat the ends of justice
because if the accused charged, is ultimately
acquitted at the trial then no reparation or
compensation can be awarded to him for the
long incarceration, as the provisions of
Criminal Procedure Code and the scheme of
law on the subject do not provide for such

arrangements to repair the loss, caused to an
accused person, detaining him in Jail without

just cause and reasonable ground.”

5. It is yet to be determined as to whether the
complainant could identify the accused and as to whether the later
introduction of the torch light could help the prosecution in identity
of the assailants, is a factor which makes the case of the petitioner
that of further inquiry. The matter was reported with a delay of 3 and
half hours in the Police Station which could not be explained,
whereas the injured/ complainant was examined at 01.30 a.m. in the
hospital just across the road. The cumulative effect of what is stated
above takes nowhere but to hold that the petitioner has been
succeeded in making out a case for bail as one of further inquiry,
resultantly, this bail petition is allowed and the accused/ petitioner is
admitted to bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds amounting to Rs.
200000/-(two lac) with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD concerned.

6. These are the detailed reasons for my short order of

the even date.
