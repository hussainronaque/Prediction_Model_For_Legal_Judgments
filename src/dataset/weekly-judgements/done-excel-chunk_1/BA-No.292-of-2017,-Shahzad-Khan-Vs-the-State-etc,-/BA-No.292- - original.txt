AG.

ABDUL SHAKOOR, _J.—The accused/ petitioner
Shahzad Khan seeks his release on bail in case F.I.R No.
95 dated 24.07.2002 under section 302/324/34 P.P.C,
Police Station Domel, Bannu.

2. The facts in brief, as per F.I.R mentioned
above, are that on 24.07.2002 at about 05.00 hours, the

complainant Madaras Khan in injured condition at
Causality of Civil Hospital, Bannu reported the matter to

the effect that he alongwith his cousins Mohabat Khan,

Banaras Khan and Saadullah were sleeping in the fields,

in the meantime accused Wali Khan alongwith unknown

person, whom if brought before him can be identified,

armed with Kalashnikovs came there, both of them

started firing at them with murderous intention as a

result of which complainant, Saadullah and Banaras

Khan were hit and got seriously injured, whereas

Mohabat Khan luckily escaped unhurt. The accused

after commission of the offence decamped from the

spot. Motive for the occurrence is stated to be dispute

over landed property. Complainant charged the accused

for the offence. The accused/ petitioner was charged in

supplementary statement on the same day. Later on

complainant and injured Banaras Khan succumbed to

the injuries and section 302 P.P.C was added in the case.

The accused/ petitioner after his arrest filed bail
application before the learned Additional Sessions

Judge-II, Bannu, which was turned down vide order

dated 06.05.2015, thereafter the trial was commenced

and till now eleven (11) witnesses have been examined.

The accused/ petitioner moved bail application before

the learned trial Court on the fresh ground of statutory

delay in conclusion of trial, which was turned down vide

order dated 12.07.2017, hence, this bail application.

3. Learned counsel for the accused/ petitioner

argued that the accused/ petitioner has been arrested on

23.04.2015 and after lapse of about two years and three

months trial of the petitioner has not yet been concluded

nor there exists any probability of its conclusion in near

future, as out of 19 witnesses up till now 11 witnesses

have been examined. He next argued that there is no

laxity on the part of accused/ petitioner, while the

prosecution lingering on the case on one pretext or

other, due to which the petitioner has earned statutory
right of bail. He next argued that the petitioner has not

been charged in the F.I.R while he has been charged

later on, without any source of information mere on

suspicion. He went on to say that the evidence up till

now recorded is contradictory to the prosecution version

and on the basis of the same the accused/ petitioner is

entitled for the concession of bail.

4. On the other hand learned A.A.G appearing

on behalf of the state assisted by learned counsel for the

complainant vehemently opposed the arguments

advanced by learned counsel for the accused and

contended that accused/ petitioner is directly charged for

the offence of double murder and attempt to murder.

They next argued that once on merits bail of accused/

petitioner has been rejected by the learned lower Court,

trial is in progress which shall be concluded in near

future, as almost eleven witnesses have been examined.

They went on to say that accused/ petitioner remained
absconder for a sufficient long time and if he is released

on bail there is apprehension of his again abscondence.

They lastly argued that delay in conclusion of the trial

occurred due to nonappearance of PWs as well as non

appearance of defence counsel, hence, on the ground of

statutory period, the accused/ petitioner is not entitled to

be released on bail.

5. Arguments heard and record perused.

6. Perusal of the record reveals that once bail

application of accused/ petitioner has been rejected by

the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu vide

order dated 06.05.2015 on merits, thereafter the accused/

petitioner did not approach to this Court and trial was

commenced. The petitioner has again agitated

concession of bail on fresh ground of statutory delay in

conclusion of trial before the learned trial court, which

was rejected vide order dated 12.07.2017. As the trial

has been commenced and as many as eleven PWs have
been recorded, I would refrain to give finding on merits

of the case, lest it may prejudice the case of either side.

7. The main contention of learned counsel for

petitioner was that the accused/ petitioner is entitled for

concession of bail on the ground of statutory ground.

The relevant portion of the third Proviso of Section 497

(1) Cr.PC is reproduced hereunder:

“Provided further that the Court shall,
except where it is of the opinion that the delay in
the trial of the accused has been occasioned by
an act or omission the accused or any other
person acting on his behalf, direct that any
person shall be released on bail----

(a) Who, being accused of any offence not
punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a
continuous period exceeding one year
or in case of a woman exceeding six
months and whose trial for such
offence has not concluded ; or

(b)Who, being accused of an offence
punishable with death, has been
detained for such offence for a

continuous period exceeding two years
and in case of a woman exceeding one
year and whose trial for such offence
has not concluded;

Provided further that the provisions of the
foregoing proviso shall not apply a previously
convicted offender for an offence punishable
with death or imprisonment for life or to a
person who, in the opinion of the court, is a
hardened, desperate or dangerous criminal or is
accused of an act of terrorism punishable with

death or imprisonment for life.”

8. Bare reading of the above proviso shows

that this proviso demands release of the accused, who

being accused of an offence per condition (a) and (b) as

the case may be, has been detained for such offence for

a continuous period exceeding one year or two years, as

the case may be (per condition (a) and (b)) but whose

trial for such offence has not been concluded within

such period, however, the demand of release is subject

to satisfaction of the Court that ‘delay in conclusion of

trial was not occasioned by any act or omission of the
accused or any other person acting on behalf of such

accused.

9. While in the instant case, the accused/

petitioner was arrested on 23.04.2015 and since then the

petitioner is behind the bars for more than two years,

whereas eleven PWs have been examined so far, while

eight material PWs are remaining, and there is no

likelihood of its conclusion in near future, hence, the

petitioner has earned the right of his release on bail on

the ground of statutory delay as provided in third

proviso (b) of section 497 (1) Cr.PC.

10. The contention of learned counsel for the

complainant that the delay occurred due to fault of

accused/ petitioner. I have gone through the brief

summary / list of the order sheets of the learned trial

court, where delay has mainly been caused by the

prosecution or the Court itself, and even if adjournments

sought by the accused/ petitioner due to absence of his
counsel or his non-availability is excluded, even then he

would be entitled to the concession of bail because in

that case too his total detention during the trial becomes

more than two years. It has been consistently held by

the apex Court that if a case on such statutory delay in

the conclusion of trial is made out then, ordinarily bail

should not be refused on hyper technical ground.

Reliance is placed on case a recent judgment of august

Supreme court delivered in case titled “Adnan Prince

Vs_the State through P.G, Punjab _and_another”

decided on 01.02.2017, wherein on the ground of

statutory delay in trial bail has been granted to the

accused and copy of judgment has been ordered to be

sent to the all concerned for compliance.

11. There is nothing on record which may

suggest that the accused/petitioner is previous convicted

for an offence punishable which death or imprisonment

for life nor he is hardened, desperate or dangerous
criminal nor he is charged for an offence of terrorism

punishable with death or imprisonment for life. The

petitioner does not come within the exception provided

under the third proviso of section 497 (1) Cr.PC.

12. The contention of learned counsel for

respondent regarding abscondence is concerned, suffice

it to say that abscondence of accused will not disentitle

him to claim bail on the ground of statutory delay,

which right accrues to him after he has been arrested and

the statutory period mentioned in clause (a) or (b) of the

third proviso to section 497 (1) Cr.PC, has expired. The

gravity of offence or abscondance, all such objections

are alien to the statutory right of bail, as in the statute no

exception has been provided in this respect.

13. For what has been discussed above, I am of

the view that the petitioner has made a case of bail on

the ground of statutory delay in trial, therefore, instant

bail is accepted, accused/petitioner is admitted to bail,
subject to furnishing bail bonds amounting to
Rs.400000/- (four lac) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned trial court. The
sureties must be local, reliable and men of means.

Announced.
