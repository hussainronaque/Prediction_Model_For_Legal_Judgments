Appellant-Petitioner

Respondent

MUHAMMAD YOUNIS THAHEEM, J:- Having

unsuccessful in obtaining bail from the two courts

below the accused/ petitioner Sabir Shah, involved in

case F.I.R No.366 dated 27.06.2014 under sections

302/324/452/34 PPC, Police Station Cantt: Kohat, has

come to this Court, through counsel, for the same relief.

2. Brief facts of case, as per FIR are that on

27.06.2014, Injured complainant reported the matter to

the effect that at 01.30 A.M at night they were all
sleeping at their home, but woke up on hearing of

footsteps in the vacant area of his first floor of the

house. Muhammad Ibrahim shouted as to who was

there and at this shout one of the accused first

threatened him to keep silent and when the deceased

switched his light on. All the persons made firing upon

him with firearms, due to which he got hit and died on

the spot. The complainant and his mother started crying

for his help. Accused also started firing at them. The

complainant reported that one of the accused stuck him

with butt of his pistol on his head, due to which he got

injured and in response, he picked up his pistol from

below his pillow and started firing upon the accused.

The accused thus starting running back from the spot

and fled away. In the meanwhile their neighbor also

reached to the spot and they also witnessed the

deadbody of one of the assailant, which was lying on

the roof top. As per complainant he had made firing
upon accused/ persons but he did not know that the

deceased accused was hit from his firing or from firing

from his co-accused. On the same day the other two

persons namely Usman and Aslam were also arrested in

injured condition, who during interrogation verified the

presence of deceased Umer and rule in the reported

occurrence. One mobile set was found by the local

police from the place of occurrence owned by the

deceased assailant Umer and on search of its SIM data

it was found that the deceased assailant Umer had made

regular conversation with the accused/ petitioner Sabir

Shah at the time of occurrence, due to which he was

also implicated in the instant case.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of the record reveals that the

accused/ petitioner is charged in the instant case on the

sole ground of SIM date recovered from deceased

assailant Umer and as the accused/ petitioner was in
regular contact with deceased Umer at the time of

occurrence. Perusal of the record shows that the data of

SIM recovered from the spot owned by deceased

assailant Umer, does not tally with the CDR report.

Further the complainant has not charged the accused/

petitioner in his first information report nor after his

arrest any identification parade was conducted.

Moreover, no incriminating article recovered from his

possession or on his pagination, hence, the case of

accused/ petitioner falls within the ambit of further

inquiry within the meaning of section 497 Cr.PC.

5. The contention of learned counsel for

complainant that bail of two accused has been refused,

hence, the present accused/ petitioner is not entitled for

the same concession. Suffice it to say that the role of

present accused/ petitioner and that of co-accused is not

at pat with, hence, the contention of complainant is

repelled.
6. Moreover, as is evident from the record, in

the present case the investigation is complete, the case

is ready for trial and as such the accused/petitioner is no

longer required to the local police for further

interrogation of the case, therefore, no useful purpose

would be served by keeping him behind the bars.

7. In view of above, there is a wide scope of

further inquiry into the guilt of accused/petitioner Sabir

Shah, resultantly, he is admitted to bail on furnishing

bail bonds, amounting to Rs. 300000/- (three lacs) with

two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction

of Illaqga Judicial Magistrate/ MOD. The sureties must

be local, reliable and men of means.
