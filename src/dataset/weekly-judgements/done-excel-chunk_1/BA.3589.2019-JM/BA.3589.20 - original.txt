JUDGMENT

2K ek

AHMAD _ALI, J. Through the instant petition, the

petitioner (Mangal) seeks his post arrest bail in case
FIR No. 155 dated 12.03.2011 under Sections
302/324/34-PPC, P.S. Nasir Bagh (Peshawar). Same
relief was however, declined to him by the learned Trial
Court vide order dated 06.11.2019.

2. In essence, the complainant reported the matter
to local police to the effect that he alongwith his
brothers was present at the spot of occurrence. In the
meanwhile, the accused petitioner and his co-accused
duly armed with deadly weapons came there and started
firing at the complainant party with intention to kill
them. As a result of firing, brothers of complainant,
namely, Faqir Muhammad & Kachkol (deceased) hit
and died on the spot, whereas he remained unhurt.

Motive for the occurrence was stated to be a dispute
over pigeons. Consequently, FIR ibid was chalked
against the accused.

3. Arguments of the learned counsel for the parties
heard and record perused with their able assistance.

2. The complainant has, though, directly charged
three persons for the commission of offence, but no
specific role has been attributed to the present accused.
No incriminating articles have been shown recovered
from his possession.

3. Even otherwise, when a general role is attributed
to accused, then role of each and every accused with
regard to their involvement in the commission of
offence will be determined by the learned trial court
after recording of pro and contra evidence.

4. The record also suggests that in the FIR, father’s
name of present accused was mentioned as Said
Muhammad whereas the actual father’s name of
accused is Hukam Khan. In this regard the guidelines
laid down in case laws reported in 1991 SCMR 959 &
1990 P.Cr.L.J_ 2055 are worth perusal.

5. As per recovery memo 6 crime empties of 7.62
bore have been shown recovered from the spot of
occurrence, but astonishingly same were not sent to
FSL, so, at the moment, it cannot be ascertained that

same were fired from one weapon or multiple weapons.
The situations lay question mark on the stance of
complainant regarding number of accused enrobed in
the instant case, which would also require evidence
during trial.

6. So far as, contention of the learned counsel for
the complainant in respect of long abscondence of the
accused-petitioner is concerned, same will hold no field
in the circumstances, when case of the accused,
squarely falls within the ambit of Sub-Section (2) of
Section 497 Cr.P.C, calling for further probe. It is by
now settled that in any case falling within the above
ambit; the grant of bail must be considered as a rule and
refusal thereof is an exception. However, in the instant
case, no exceptional circumstance exists to refuse bail
to the accused, when the other circumstances,
tentatively are in his favour. Reliance can be placed on
case laws reported in 2018 MLD 125, PLJ 2017 SC
115, 2016 SCMR 1520, 2016 SCMR 1593, PLD 2012
SC 222, 2015 P.Cr.L.J 1005 & 2012 YLR 2090.
Petitioner is behind the bars since his arrest and is no
more required for further investigation.

7. Moreover, it has been held time and again by the
august Supreme Court that bail does not mean acquittal
of accused but only change of custody from

Government agencies to the sureties, who on furnishing
bonds take responsibility to produce the accused
whenever and wherever required to be produced.
Reliance could be placed on case reported in 2008
SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

8. Before parting with the order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded
above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of bail
petition and not intended to influence the mind of trial
Court, which is free to appraise the evidence strictly in

accordance with law and merits of the case and; as per law

laid down in (1996 SCMR 1845).

9. In view of the above discussion and on tentative
assessment of material available on file, a case arguable
for the grant of bail is made out. Resultantly, this
petition is allowed and the accused-petitioner, named
above, is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail
bonds in the sum of Rs.200,000/- with two sureties each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate concerned, who shail
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

4. Above are the detailed reasons of short order of
even date.
