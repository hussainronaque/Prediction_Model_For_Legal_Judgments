JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 07.05.2020

Petitioner by: Mr. Imran Ali Shah advocate.
Respondent by: Mr. Umer Qayyum Khan advocate.

State by: — Mr. Qudratullah Khan Gandapur Asstt: A.G.

SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH, J.- The petitioners after having
been booked in case F.I.R No 82 dated 09.03.2020, under section
302/404/34 P.P.C, 15 A.A, were arrested and after their arrest they
applied for post arrest bail before the Court of Additional Sessions
Judge-IV, Bannu, for their release on bail, which was regretted vide
order dated 18.04.2020. Feeling aggrieved the petitioners approached
this Court through the instant bail petition.

2. Brief facts giving rise to the instant bail application are
that on 09.03.2020, complainant Mst. Dilshad Bibi, wife of Akmal
Riaz brought the dead-body of her deceased son Murtaza Akmal to
Civil Hospital, Bannu, and reported the matter to the local police,

wherein she stated that yesterday i.e. on 08.03.2020, after Isha vela

she alongwith her son left their house to irrigate their lands, when
reached to the place of occurrence, it was about 19.30 hours, the
accused Manoor Khan and Wazir sons of Zar Gul were already present
duly armed with pistols, on seeing the deceased the accused started
firing to commit his murder as a result the deceased was hit, fell on the
ground and succumbed to the injuries. The accused were identified in
the torch light. After committing the murder of the deceased the
accused took the Kalashnikov of the deceased alongwith its
magazines, mobile phone and a wallet containing different documents.
She further stated that as no one was present to help her in transporting
the dead-body of the deceased, so she spent night with the deceased on
the spot and could not report the matter at the earliest. The motive was
stated to be blood feud between the parties.

3. Learned counsel for the parties alongwith Asstt:
Advocate General were heard at length and with their valuable
assistance the record was gone through.

4, The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that as
the darkness had prevailed at the time of incident, so the identification
in torch light was next to impossible. It was submitted that the
presence of the complainant is not established on record and that the
murder was un-witnessed. He lastly submitted that the delay of 12-
hours leaves no room but to hold that the case is that of further
inquiry.

5. Conversely the learned counsel for the complainant
alongwith Asstt: Advocate General argued that the petitioners are

directly charged and no mala fide could be attributed to the

\

complainant being a real mother. They further submitted that the delay
has been explained in the best possible way.

6. The record tells that the complainant allegedly went with
her deceased son to irrigate their fields and that it was on reaching to
the place of occurrence, when the incident occurred. Though the
complainant asserted her presence with the deceased at the time of the
occurrence, yet this Court is to see as to whether at such odd hours of
the night and in the prevalent custom of the land her presence on the
spot with her deceased son appeals to mind or not. Nothing was
brought on record that in fact the complainant had accompanied her
deceased son for irrigating the fields and no witness was examined in
this respect. The question as to whether the assailants were identified
in the torch light can better be determined by the trial Court. One
intriguing aspect of the case is that the motive has been stated to be
blood feud between the parties but despite in close range only the
deceased was targeted and the complainant was left alive being at their
mercy. The matter was reported at 07.00 a.m with a delay of 12- hours
which the complainant failed to explain and the explanation she
tendered was that she spent the whole night with the deceased on the
spot as no one was present to help her in transporting the dead-body
from the spot either to her house or to the Police Station, which
explanation at present is hard to be accepted unless and until the
matter is assessed by the trial Court after recording pro and contra
evidence. The petitioners were arrested soon after the occurrence but
nothing incriminating was recovered from their possession, however,
the Kalashnikov allegedly taken from the deceased was recovered

from possession of one Hazrat Umar s/o Umar Gul. Though the law is

settled that while seized of bail matters the Courts are to assess
tentatively and deeper appreciation is not warranted, but this is also
settled that bail applications cannot be heard in vacuum and the Courts

should and can consider the available record for the purpose.

In case titled “Zaigham Ashraf Vs the State and others” (2016
SCMR 18), wherein it is held that:

“9. To curtail the liberty of a person is a
serious step in law, therefore, the Judges
Shall apply judicial mind with deep thought
for reaching at a fair and proper conclusion
albeit tentatively however, this exercise shall
not to be carried out in vacuum or in a
flimsy and casual manner as that will defeat
the ends of justice because if the accused
charged, is ultimately acquitted at the trial
then no reparation or compensation can be
awarded to him for the long incarceration,
as the provisions of Criminal Procedure
Code and the scheme of law on the subject
do not provide for such arrangements to
repair the loss, caused to an accused person,
detaining him in Jail without just cause and
reasonable ground.

7. After assessing the record this court can form no other
view but to hold that the petitioners have been succeeded in making
out a case for bail as one of further inquiry and deserve the requested
concession. Furthermore, the investigation is complete and the
accused/ petitioners are no more required to the investigating agency.

8. For what has been discussed above, this bail application
is allowed and the accused / petitioners are admitted to bail subject to

furnishing bail bonds amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-(two lacs), with two

sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa Judicial
Magistrate/ MOD concerned.

Above are the reasons of my short order of the even

date.
