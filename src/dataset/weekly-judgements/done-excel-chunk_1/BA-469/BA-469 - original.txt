3: This is another attempt for all the
grounds enumerated in this application with the

following prayer:-

"It is therefore, humbly prayed
that by accepting this petition, the
accused/Petitioner may kindly be
released on bail till the final decision
of the instant case."

4, The asservations as per contents of
the First Information Report against the
Petitioner are that he alongwith Aziz-ur-
Rehman caught hold of Faiz Muhammad
husband of the complainant, who was killed by
Shah Zoor Khan co-accused by giving him
spade blows, whereas Zafar Khan is charged for
causing injury to the complainant Mst. Bakht
Mahal Bibi on her left hand wrist through stick

blows.

5: Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned Astt: Advocate
General for the State, record with their

assistance gone through.

6. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

referred to 2017 SCMR_ 279 " Qurban Ali vs

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
the State and others", 2016 SCMR 1593 "

Muhammad Shafi and others vs the State and
others'', 2009 SCMR 299 "' Mitho Pitafi vs the
State", 2016 SCMR _1520_'' Muhammad

PLD 2010 Karachi 384 " Ghulam _Rasool ys

Muhammad _Ahmad_ Javed ys the State and
others. In the light of these dictums of the
Hon'ble superior Courts prayed for the grant of
bail in favour of the Petitioner. Inversely,
learned counsel for the complainant assisted by
learned Astt: Advocate General for the State

placed reliance on Lal Zameen vs the State and

another", 2003 P_Cr.LJ 1691 (Peshawar) "'

Muhammad vs Muhammad Siraj-ud-Din_ and

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
others" and PLJ 2012 S.C. 169 '"' Muhammad

Abbasi _vs_the State, thereby prayed for utter

dismissal of the bail petition.

Te It is as pointed out that either the
Petitioner has remained in absconsion for
sufficient length of time, yet his role is on better
footing than role assigned to co-accused Zafar
Khan, who was already enlarged on bail and
after facing trial eventually was acquitted. Yes,
there is mark difference between role of the
accused/Petitioner and that of co-accused Zafar
Khan, as the Petitioner is only charged for
catching hold of the deceased, thus, in the
attending circumstances of the case, his role
would require further inquiry into his guilt
therefore, at this juncture he is entitled to the

concession of bail.

8. Even otherwise, it is settled by now
that mere absconsion of an accused by itself is
no ground for refusal of bail, if otherwise, case
of accused/Petitioner is of further inquiry. In

this respect wisdom is derived from the

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
po

5
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court cited as

as "Ehsan Ullah Vs The State" (2012 SCMR

1137), wherein relevant citation speaks off:-

"It is settled law that in a

case calling for further

inquiry into the guilt of an

accused person bail is to

be allowed to him as of

right and not by way of

grace or concession and

in such a case mere

absconsion of the relevant

accused person may not

be sufficient to refuse bail

to him."
9. In view of the above, the
accused/Petitioner is admitted to bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of
Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two lacs) with two
sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who shall

ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and

men of means.

10. These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.

11. Needless to mention that the

observations made above are purely tentative

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
in nature and should in no way prejudice the

case of either party during trial.
