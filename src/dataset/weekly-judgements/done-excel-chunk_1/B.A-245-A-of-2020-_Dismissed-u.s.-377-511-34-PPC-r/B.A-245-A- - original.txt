SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This petition has
been moved on behalf of Aon Ali for admitting
him to bail till the final conclusion of trial in
Crime No. 100 dated 09.02.2020 registered
under Sections 377 / 511 / 34 PC read with
Section 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 at Police
Station Khanpur District Haripur.

2. The allegation, as set forth in the
crime report, against the petitioner is that he
took the complainant to his house and
facilitated his co-accused namely, Sumair to
commit sodomy upon him. Vide order dated
16.03.2020, he was declined post arrest bail
by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-ll,
Haripur, hence, this petition.

3. | have heard the arguments of

learned counsel for the parties at length and
gone through the record with their valuable
assistance.

4. No doubt, the petitioner has not been
charged for committing sodomy upon the
minor victim, but, it cannot be said that he
neither aided or facilitated his co-accused
Sumair in committing unnatural offence. As
per crime report, petitioner is alleged to have
taken away the victim in his house in a
scheming / pre-planned manner on_ the
pretext to impart knowledge of computer to
him, because if the victim had least doubt that
he was going to be physically abused, he
would not have accompanied the petitioner.
The victim was taken by the petitioner to his
house, where he was put in defenceless
condition by him and facilitated his co-
accused to commit the crime and on hue and
cry raised by the victim, he also put Rs.50/- in
his pocket and asked him to leave the
premises and not to disclose the crime to
anyone else. The petitioner appears to have
acted in preconcert or shared common
intention with his co-accused, who committed
sodomy upon the victim and can be saddled

by constructive or vicarious liability as
provided in Section 34 PPC. In this behalf
reliance can be placed on the well known
Hadith of the Holly Prophet Mohammad
(P.B.U.H) which is reproduced as under: -

5. In the famous case of “Muhammad
Riaz Vs. Federal Government” reported in
PLD 1980 FSC 01 the Hon’ble Judges of the
Federal Shariat Court quoted two references
of Ahadith, which are reproduced from page-
10 of the said judgment hereunder: -

‘It has been held by _ the
Peshawar Bench that an offence
of murder can be condoned by
pardon, or on payment of ‘Diyat’,
otherwise the convict was to face
the penalty of death. The same
principle will be attracted in the
cases of abettors under Sections
109 & 114 of PPC. In support

thereof, reliance is placed on two
Ahadith as to be found on Page
740, Voll! of  Mishkat-Al-
Masabih, as translated in English
by James Robson:

“Ibne Umar reported the Prophet
Mohammad (P.B.U.H) as saying,
if a man seizes a man and
another kills him, the man, who
killed him, is to be killed and the
one, who seized him, is to be
imprisoned. Daraqutni transmitted
it.

Said-b-Al-Musayyib told _ that
Umar bin Al-Khattab killed five or
seven people for one man, whom
they had killed treacherously,
Umar saying ‘If the people of
San’a’ had conspired against
him, | would have killed them all’.
Malik transmitted it, and Bukhari
transmitted something similar on

the authority of Ibne Umar.”

6. In this behalf, | am also fortified by
the judgment reported as “Mulo Ahmed Vs.
The State” (2011 MLD 1171) wherein it was
observed as under: -

“The principle of vicarious
liability can be looked into even
at bail stage if from the F.LR.,
the accused appears to have
acted in pre-concert or shared
the community of intention with

his co-accused who caused
fatal injury to deceased and
can be saddled by constructive
or vicarious liability by invoking
section 34, P.P.C. The Court
on the basis of material placed,
such as F.I.R. and statements
recorded by the police even at
bail stage consider the
question whether the case of
constructive liability is made
out or not. Paramount
consideration is whether the
accused was a member of an
unlawful assembly or whether
the offence has been
committed in furtherance of the
common object. In the case in
hand, though the allegation
against the present applicant is
of making aerial firing along
with co-accused and has not
caused any fire arm injury to
the deceased but his
undeniable presence on_ the
place of incident duly armed
with weapon shows his motive
of preplanned’ concert’ in
furtherance of common object
with principal accused. It is not
a case of sudden provocation
rendering the matter one of
further inquiry. It is clear from
the contents of F.I.R._ that
accused persons including the

applicant duly armed with
weapons were waiting the
complainant party on the road
and they raised Hakal and
stopped the complainant party
and committed the murder of
complainant's __ father. The
judgments cited by learned
counsel for the applicant are
distinguishable as in these
cases, question of considering
the vicarious liability at bail
stage and sharing the common
object was not an issue. While
judgments relied upon by
learned counsel for the
complainant are applicable so
far as related to sharing the
common intention to commit
the murder. It is also important
to note that no explanation
whatsoever is rendered to
justify the presence of the
accused at the place of
occurrence which leads to a
tentative view that the applicant
shared common intention to
commit the murder of
deceased. Nothing is available
on record to show _ that
complainant party had any
motive or reason to falsely
implicate the accused in the
case. Case is at preliminary
stage and evidence of none of

prosecution witnesses has
been recorded. Court at bail
stage, could not undertake
deeper appreciation of the
evidence of prosecution.”
7. The upshot of above discussion
leads me to the conclusion that on the face of
record, there are reasonable grounds to
believe that the petitioner has shared
common intention with co-accused and
facilitated him to commit the crime of sodomy.
Resultantly, this petition for bail of the
petitioner fails and is dismissed
