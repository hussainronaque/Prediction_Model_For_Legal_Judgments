QAISER _RASHID _KHAN, _J. The
accused/petitioner seeks bail in case FIR No. 241 dated
20.06.2015 registered under section 302 PPC, at Police

Station Lahor District Swabi after being declined the
said relief by the learned Courts below.

2. The allegations against the accused-petitioner are
that he killed the son of the complainant by causing stab
wound to him, hence the FIR ibid.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that
the accused-petitioner is innocent and has been falsely
charged by the complainant. He further contended that it
is unexceptional that while the son was being stabbed to
death, still the complainant did not make any effort to
rescue his son or for that matter to grab the accused-

petitioner and only let him go. The other argument
strongly advanced by the learned counsel for the
accused-petitioner is that the accused-petitioner is a
juvenile being under 16 years of age and thus he is
entitled to bail as per the first proviso to Sub-section (1)
of Section 497 Cr.PC.

4. The learned AAG assisted by the learned counsel
for the complainant on their turn vehemently opposed
the bail petition and contended that the accused-
petitioner is directly charged for causing stab wound to
the son of the complainant which resulted in his death
and that the offence being heinous in nature, therefore,
the accused-petitioner is disentitled to bail. As far as
juvenility of the accused-petitioner is concerned, they
contended that the same alone would not hold him
entitled to bail if he is otherwise held disentitled to the
said concession.

5. Arguments heard and available record perused.

6. As evident from the promptly lodged FIR by
Hayat Gul complainant, he has directly charged the
accused-petitioner by alleging that he came to his field
where he entered into altercation with his son Mansoor
and thereafter caused stab wound to him with his knife
which resulted in his death while being taken to the
hospital in injured condition. No doubt the juveniles

deserve lenient view of the Courts in criminal matters
but certainly not in each and every case. In a situation
where a young lad approximately 16 years of age picks
up a knife and on mere altercation stabs another boy by
targeting his heart region, then I am afraid, juvenility
recedes to the background and only his vicious act is to
be kept in view while considering his plea for the grant
of bail. Certainly the first proviso to Sub-section (1) of
Section 497 Cr.P.C has not made it mandatory and
obligatory for the courts of law to favourably consider
the bail petitions of the juveniles, howsoever, offensive
and heinous the offence may be. This Court cannot lose
sight of the fact that, of late, the youth and particularly
the teenagers either being influenced by the media
galore whereby violence is being projected and
portrayed within an air of heroism about it or because of
the rising tide of militancy in the society have fallen
easy prey to such tendencies and have thus got involved
in gruesome acts, at times with chilling details. The
same should serve as a food for thought for the powers
that be and for the society at large.

For the reasons stated above, this bail petition
stands dismissed.

Any observations recorded in the above order
being tentative in nature should in no manner prejudice

the proceedings before the learned trial judge where the
case be decided on its own merits after recording of
evidence.
