AG.

ISHTIAQ IBRAHIM, J.--- Accused/ petitioner Ghulam

Ali seeks his release on bail in case F.I.R No.151 dated

06.03.2017, under section 302/324/404/34 P.P.C, Police

Station Lakki Marwat.

2. Inayatullah Khan, complainant on 06.03.2017

at city Hospital, Lakki Marwat reported the matter to the

effect that he alongwith son Hamayatullah, brother

Abdullah Khan, Irfanullah were present in courtyard of

their baithak. At 07.00 hours, accused/ petitioner Ghulam

Ali and co-accused Abdur Rehman, duly armed with
-2-
Kalashnikov, repeater appeared. Accused/ petitioner

Ghulam Ali fired at Abdullah Khan, due to which he was

hit and injured, while co-accused Abdur Rehman fired at

complainant his son Hamayatullah and Irfanullah, as a

result of which Irfanullah sustained injuries. Outside the

baithak, accused/ petitioner Ghulam Ali fired at Abdur

Rehman, due to which he also sustained injuries. Accused/

petitioner also took away Kalashnikov and repeater from

the said Abdur Rehman. The injured Abdullah and Abdur

Rehman later on succumbed to injuries. hence the above

mentioned F.I.R.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. During investigation several persons from the

locality, appeared before the investigation officer and

alleged false implication of accused/ petitioner in this case,

particularly, the eye-witnesses of the occurrence Sharifullah

and the persons with whom the accused/ petitioner was

present at the alleged time of occurrence. They also tried to

record their statements under section 164 Cr.PC, with

respect to innocence of accused/ petitioner and in
-3-
confirmation of his plea of alibi, as they want to support the

version of accused/ petitioner their request was turned down

and the investigation officer was directed to form his

opinion in light of evidence collected in the case. The

investigation Officer placed his name in the Column 2 of

the challan. It is settled principle and rule that once an

accused has been declared innocent during the course of

investigation and is placed in Column 2, then he is no more

an accused person nor he can be treated so unless and until

after submission of challan the trial court takes cognizance

and summon him for trial. No doubt, opinion of

Investigating officer in the case are not binding upon the

court and cannot be made the only basis for granting bail,

but the Court would examine the material available on file

and form his opinion. Reliance is placed on case titled

w

‘Mohammad Ilyas Vs Ijaz Mohammad Batt and another”

1992 SC MR 1857), wherein it is held that:

“We propose to dispose of this petition on
the short ground that respondent No.1 Ijaz
Ahmad Butt is not an accused person so
far as his name is not included in the
challan in the column of accused persons

but appears in column No.2 of the challan
-4-
because investigation agency was short of
material against him. He himself on his
own approached the trial Court for bail
and on failure filed application in the High
Court for that purpose. It appears that so
far neither police has taken any steps to
arrest him because for doing so police has
to show that sufficient material is available
against him and his name for that reason is
to be taken out from column No.2 and put
in the column of accused persons who are
not in custody. Similarly trial court has not
taken any steps to show that respondent
No.1 Ijaz Ahmad butt was being treated as

accused person.”

5. In addition to the above, the mode and manner

of occurrence, disparity in medico-legal examination of the

injured and the tim e of report, could be resolved after

recording of evidence, till then the case of accused/

petitioner requires further inquiry under section 497 (2)

Cr.PC.

6. The accused cannot be kept in jail as

punishment merely on the ground that he is directly

charged for an offence falling under the prohibitory clause

of section 497 Cr.PC, because a mistaken relief of bail may

be repaired by convicting the accused, if proved guilty, but
-5-
no proper reparation can be offered for his unjustified

incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long run. Reliance

is placed on case titled “Zaigham Ashraf Vs the State and

others’ (2016 SCMR 18),wherein it is held that:

“9. To curtail the liberty of a person is
a serious step in law, therefore, the
Judges shall apply judicial mind with
deep thought for reaching at a fair and
proper conclusion albeit tentatively
however, this exercise shall not to be
carried out in vacuum or in a flimsy
and casual manner as that will defeat
the ends of justice because if the
accused charged, __is_ __ ultimately
acquitted at the trial then no reparation
or compensation can be awarded to
him for the long incarceration, as the
provisions of Criminal Procedure Code
and the scheme of law on the subject
do not provide for such arrangements
to repair the loss, caused to an accused
person, detaining him in Jail without

just cause and reasonable ground.”

7. For the afore stated reasons this bail

application is allowed, resultantly, accused/ petitioner

Ghulam Ali is admitted to bail on furnishing bail bonds to

the sum of Rs.6,00,000/- (Six lac) with two sureties each in
-6-
the like amount to the satisfaction of Jlaqa Judicial

Magistrate/MOD.

Above are the reasons of my short order of the

even date.

Announced.
