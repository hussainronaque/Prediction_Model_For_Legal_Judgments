FAZAL SUBHAN, J.— Instant is post arrest bail of petitioner
Umar Ali son of Nasrat Ali, arrested in case FIR No.47 dated
24.6.2023 registered under section 9-D and 17 KP CNSA, 2019
of PS Excise, Mardan.

2. Facts of the case are that on 24.6.2023 at 19:00
hours Inspector Muhammad Riaz SHO intercepted a motorcar
No.LLE-14-8048 and on query the driver disclosed his name as
Imtiaz Ahmad son of Riaz Ahmad while another person sitting
on the front seat revealed himself as Umar Ali son of Nasrat Ali
(the present petitioner). Upon search of the motorcar from
underneath the front seats 20/20 total 40 packets of chars
concealed in secret cavities were recovered and on weighment
were found to be 48000 grams and after necessary proceedings
on the spot both the accused were arrested and murasila was

sent to the PS for registration of case.

3. With this background of the case, arguments of
learned counsel for petitioner and learned AAG for State heard
and after tentative assessment of record, it is clear that
petitioner was not driver of the vehicle nor any connection of
the petitioner with the main accused Imtiaz Ahmad has yet
been established. At the same time there is nothing on record to
show that the vehicle belongs to the petitioner, rather as per
contents of FIR, he was seated in the vehicle on front seat and it
is yet to be established during trial that the petitioner had
conscious knowledge of the presence of narcotics in the
concealed cavities of the vehicle. In such like situation case of
the petitioner falls within the ambit of further inquiry into his
guilt. This court in Cr. Misc: B.A No.3147-P/2021 in a similar
situation has granted bail to the petitioner Musa Khan with the
following observations:-

“True that huge quantity of narcotic has been
recovered from secret cavities made in diggi of
the motorcar which was in full control and
possession of co-accused Muhammad Rafiq but
noticeable aspect of the case is that the
petitioner was found sitting on front seat of the
vehicle at the time of recovery. There is nothing
on the case file to show that either the petitioner
was privy to the bid of smuggling or was
having any slightest conscious knowledge
about presence of the recovered contraband in
the car so as to show his nexus with the foiled
attempt of the smuggling. Thus his participation
in the crime needs further consideration. No
doubt 20 gram heroin and 10 gram ice has been
recovered from direct possession of the
petitioner but ibid meager quantity of
contraband would not be made a base to dub
-3-

him as co-smuggler of the narcotic which is
subject matter of the instant case.”

4. In another case titled “Gul Manan-Vs-the State”

reported in 2021 SCMR 1804 (Supreme Court of Pakistan) it

has been held that:-

“After hearing the learned counsel for the
petitioner and learned counsel appearing on
behalf of State at length and perusal of
available record, it has been observed by us that
it has not been disputed that when the vehicle
was stopped by the police, the petitioner was
merely sitting in the vehicle and he was not
driving the said vehicle. Narcotics. were
allegedly recovered from the secret cavities of
the vehicle. Learned counsel appearing on
behalf of State after going through the file
confirm that there is no connection of the
petitioner with the vehicle and even nothing
was recovered from his personal possession or
on his pointation. He, however, contends that
petitioner was in the vehicle and in the
circumstances it can be safely presumed that he
had conscious knowledge of the narcotics
concealed in that vehicle and even he attempted
to run away from the spot, when the police
signaled the vehicle to stop. The question, the
petitioner who was not a driver of the vehicle
has conscious knowledge of the narcotics
concealed in the vehicle needs _ serious
consideration, which shall be determined by the
learned trial Court after recording evidence. In
the circumstances, case against the petitioner
calls for further inquiry falling within the ambit
of section 497 (2), Code of Criminal
Procedure.”

5. For these reasons and while relying upon the
above referred judgments, petitioner has made out a case for
grant o bail. Resultantly, this petition for post arrest bail is
allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail subject to

furnishing bail bonds of Rs.3,00,000/- (three lacs) with two
-4-

sureties, each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate. Sureties must be local, reliable
and men of means. Above are the detailed reasons of my short
order of the even date.
