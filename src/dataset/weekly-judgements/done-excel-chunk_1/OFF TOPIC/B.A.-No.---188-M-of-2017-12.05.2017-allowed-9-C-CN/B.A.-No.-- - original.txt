Petitioner:- (Bacha Khan) by Mr. Abdul Jalal,

Advocate.

Respondents:- (the State & I another) by

Barrister Asad Hameed-ur-Rahman State
counsel.

MOHAMMAD _ IBRAHIM KHAN, _J.-_ The

'Murasila' followed by the lodging of the First
Information Report pertains to case FIR No.
377 dated 11.04.2017 registered under sections
9 (C) CNSA & 15 A.A. at Police Station Matta
District Swat. The report says about that the
police officials had received an information that
notorious smuggler is present in his house and
is busy in sale of narcotics. Upon such
information, raid was conducted and an accused
by the name of Bacha Khan was apprehended.
Upon his personal search from right side pocket
white plastic bag containing "ICE" weighing 10

grams were recovered alongwith 30 bore pistol
Nawab

bearing No. H-76274, 3 chargers and 17 live
rounds. Later, on further search from doweling
room of the said accused a box was recovered
which contained two (2) packets of 'Chars', each
packet on weighment come to 1000 grams. For
chemical analysis 5 grams 'Chars' and 1 gram
â€˜ICE' were separated and sent to the Laboratory,
while rest of the recovered contraband Chars

and 'ICE' were sealed into separate parcels.

2. On implication of the said accused
Bacha Khan in order to seek his liberty an
application bearing No. 134/4 of the year 2017
for the grant of similar relief was earlier
preferred before the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge/Izafi Zila Qazi /Judge Special
Court Matta Swat, which was dismissed for the

all reasons recorded therein on 20.04.2017.

3. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner and learned State
counsel, record with their assistance gone

through.
Nawab

4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner

referred to PLJ 2004 Cr.C. (Peshawar) 79 "

Zar Gul vs the State", PLJ 2004 Cr.C (Lahore)
83_(DB) " Khalid alias Libro vs the State",

2008 YLR 2014 (Peshawar) "Hakeem Shah
the State", 1998 P Cr. LJ 370 (Lahore) "
Muhammad Usman ys the State", 2000 P Cr.
LJ _ 657 (Karachi) " Gul Hassan Dero vs the
State" and 2000 _P Cr. LJ 674 (Karachi) "
Ranjho vs the State" and in the light of these
dictums of the Hon'ble superior Courts prayed
for the grant of bail in favour of the Petitioner.
Inversely learned State counsel vehemently
opposed the submissions put-forward by learned
counsel for the Petitioner and prayed for utter
dismissal of the bail petition in view of the fact
of previous involvement of the
accused/Petitioner in recovery of contraband
effected from his personal possession. He has
been previously convicted by the Courts of
competent jurisdiction under alike offences. He
further added that as the recovery of

amphetamine (ICE) and two separate reports
Nawab

pertaining to the recovery of Chars have been
found in positive, therefore the Petitioner is not

at all entitled to the concession of bail.

5. Whereas recovery of amphetamine
(ICE) is concerned, it may be very dangerous
drug, but its quantity is only 10 grams.
Moreover, in view of the recovery of Chars two
packets weighing 1000 grams each, it is a
border line case between sub-clauses (b) and (c)
of section 9 CNSA and punishment is always to
be awarded for the offence in commensuration
with the quantum of recovery of contraband,
therefore, the quantum of punishment has to be
ascertained by the Trial Court. In such like
cases whether the accused would be liable to the
maximum punishment provided for the offence
and also as to whether the punishment in case of
proof of the guilt after trial in the circumstances
would fall under the prohibitory clause are the
questions requiring further probe, as
punishment provided under section 9(c) CNSA

1997 varies according to the circumstances of
Nawab

the case commensurating with the quantum of

recovery.

6. In such state of affairs, being a case
of further inquiry the Petitioner is entitled to the
concession of bail. Hence he is asked to furnish
bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees
two lacs) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Trial
Court, who shall ensure that the sureties are

local, reliable and men of means.

These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.
