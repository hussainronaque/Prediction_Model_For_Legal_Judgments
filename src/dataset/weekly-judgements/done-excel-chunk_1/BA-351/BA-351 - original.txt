Judge-1/Izafi Zila Qazi Dir Upper while
disposing of B.A. No. 134/IV of the year 2017

observed that an accused being charged in the
FIR with certain specific role being given to
him of firing upon the complainant. The
medical report is in consonance with the version
of prosecution, there are reasonable grounds to
believe that the offence with which the accused
has been charged fallen within the restrictive

clause of section 497 (1) Cr.P.C. The

‘occurrence being taken place in broad day light.

There is no misidentification and there are
reasons to believe that the witnesses may be

7. Although, the Petitioner is named in
the First Information Report, who has been
given the role to have fired upon the
complainant Asif Ali alongwith fire shots being

attributed to Hayat Khan co-accused, but these

fire shots were fired simultaneously, it needs to

examine the complainant as to when the fire
shots were fired at the same time by Naqab
Khan and Hayat Khan, how the complainant has
witnessed the fire shots of the
accused/Petitioner having hit him on his right
knee. According to the medical report the
injuries being sustained by the complainant is of
the type of ghayr-jaifah munaqgilah and
Shajjah-i-khafifah, which entail punishment of
Daman and may also be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term
which may extend to two & seven years

respectively as ta'zir.

8. It is also yet to establish if the
accused/Petitioner had intention to kill the
complainant he would have rightly fired straight

on the complainant. The co-accused Hayat

7

Khan who has already been enlarged on bail has
also fired upon the complainant, whose fire
shots were stated to be proved ineffective. It ts
also a matter to think over as to why
accused/Petitioner Naqab Khan was selected as
choice for effective firing upon. the person of

complainant.

9. Above are the dictums of the
Hon'ble superior Courts as referred by learned
counsel for the Petitioner, the judgment reported

in 2008 SCMR 162] tilted as "Umar Hayat vs

the State and others" speaks off:-

"Accused had allegedly fired 4/5 shots
from his pistol on complainant, out of |
them one fire hit on his left knee. Said
injury fell within the ambit of S. 337 F (v)
PPC. Accused had rightly been granted
bail Trial Court and High Court while
cancélling the same had failed to observe

whether bail granting order was

arbitrary, capricious or fanciful. Petition
pod

a

for leave to appeal was converted into
appeal and allowed and accused was

granting bail in circumstances."

10. The acquittal or conviction is

always based on the evidence to be adduced by

the prosecution, this absolute right still rest with
the learned trial Court - yet when there are
reasons to believe that the punishment may not
fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497
Cr.P.C then such an accused is entitled to the

concession of bail.

11. In view of the above, the Petitioner
is enlarged on bail subject to his furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two
lacs) with two sureties each in the like amount
to the satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who

shall ensure that the sureties are local, reliable

and men of means.

12. These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.
