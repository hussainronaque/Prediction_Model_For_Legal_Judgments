JUDGMENT

ABDUL SHAKOOR, J .- Accused/Petitioners Kifayat,

Abid Ali, Farman and Riyasat have filed this Petition
under section 439 Cr.P.C. read with Section 561-A
Cr.P.C. against the dismissal of their application
which they filed before the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XI, Peshawar under section 265-K
Cr.P.C. for their acquittal in the case FIR No.345
dated 25.4.2013 registered under section
302/324/148/149 PPC at Police Station Chamkani,

Peshawar.
2. Facts giving rise to the filing of instant
petition are that on 25.4.2013 respondent No.1
Samiullah lodged aforementioned FIR for the murder
of his father Inayatullah, wherein present petitioners
and their two brothers, namely, Wajid and Jawad
were charged for his murder. Petitioners after their
arrest except petitioner Kifayatullah have applied for
their release on bail. At that stage complainant party
i.e. (L.Rs of deceased of Inayatullah) and petitioners
patched up the matter regarding the alleged murder
of deceased Inayatullah. Subsequent to the said
development the male members of complainant
party made a statement before the learned trial court
wherein they categorically stated that matter has
been patched up between the accused party
(petitioners) and complainant, the same is genuine
and entered between them without any coercion and
they have waived of their right of Qisas and Diyat
and also pardoned the accused party (petitioners) in
the name of Almighty Allah and they have no
objection if the accused/petitioners are released on
bail or acquitted in the aforementioned case FIR. The

joint statement of male members of the complainant
party was exhibited on the record of the aforesaid
case FIR as Ex.PB. The learned trial Court after
recording the statements of male L.Rs of deceased
vide order dated 05.6.2013 appointed one Miss
Sonia advocate as local commissioner for recording
the statements of female LRs and one son of the
deceased, namely Irshad Khan. The © said
advocate/counsel Miss.Sonia Naz in the light of the
order of learned Trial Court visited the house of
complainant party and recorded their joint statement
which was exhibited on the record of the aforesaid
case FIR as Ex.PD. The statements of all the female
L.Rs of deceased and son Irshad Khan recorded by
the said local commission clearly shows that they
have pardoned the accused party i.e. petitioners in
the name of Allah and waived off their right of Qisas
and Diyat and they were having no objection if the
present petitioners were granted bail or acquitted of
the charges levelled against them. The same
compromise was also translated into proforma
meant for affecting compromise under Qisas and
Diyat Ordinance and marked as Ex.PE on the record

of above said case. As a result of that compromise,
petitioners were released on bail, while Wajid and
Jawad brothers of petitioners at trial stage were
acquitted. It was highly unjust and unfair petitioners
who were released on bail of the said compromise
like their brothers Wajid and Jawad but were not
acquitted alongwith them. This constrained the
present petitioners for filing an application under
section 265-K Cr.P.C. for their acquittal on the basis
of aforesaid compromise and statements of L.Rs of
deceased Inayatullah which as hinted hereinabove
are exhibited on the record of the aforesaid case FIR
as Ex.PB, PD and PE. However, the learned trial
Court without taking into consideration the above
said exhibits PB,PD and PE has dismissed the
application of petitioners which they filed under
section 265-K Cr.P.C. vide order dated 09.6.2016.
Feeling aggrieved from the aforesaid order, the
present petitioners have approached this Court for
their acquittal on the basis of above said exhibits
PB,PD and PE.

3. We have heard learned counsel for the
parties and have gone through the record with their

valuable assistance.
4. Perusal of the record reveals that all the
accused have been assigned the same role in the
aforesaid case FIR, which by no stretch of
imagination could be termed as an effective role for
the murder of the deceased Inayatullah. The record
further reveals that with sincere efforts of the notable
of the area a genuine compromise at the bail stage
has been effected between the parties for an end to
the enmity once for all, as both the parties are closely
related to each other. As a result of that compromise
the present petitioners were released on bail and
none of the L.Rs of the deceased referred to in the
aforesaid exhibits which are part and parcel of the
record of the trial Court has pointed his finger on the
said compromise at the bail stage. The same
compromise clearly shows that all the L.Rs of
deceased Inayatullah have waived off their right of
Qisas and Diyat against the present petitioners and
they have got no objection on their enlargement on
bail and acquittal at the trial stage in the said case
FIR. The compromise arrived between the parties
was not confined to the matter of bail only but the

same pertains to the entire case. Complainant/L.Rs
of deceased Inayatullah and one injured person had
undertaken to get the petitioners acquitted from the
trial Court when that stage was to arrive. In this view
of the matter, the trial Court on account of resiling of
L.Rs. of the deceased from the compromise at trial
stage was not justified to decline the acquittal of
present petitioners. It is well settled principle of
administration of justice and law that a compromise
in a criminal case could not be allowed to resile from
if it had already acted upon, compromise effected
between the parties at the bail stage still ensure to the
benefit of accused person and the complainant/L.Rs.
of deceased Inayatullah and injured person could not
be allowed to resile from the same. In this regard, we
are fortified by the dictum laid down by the august
Supreme Court in the case titled Syed _ Iftikhar
Hussain Shah Versus Syed Sabir Hussain Shah and 2
others (1998 SCMR 466) and Manzoor Ahmed and
another Vs. The State and 2 others PLD 2003
Lahore 739).

6. For what has been discussed and

observed above, we are fully convinced that the
compromise arrived at between the parties at the
stage of petitioners bail still ensure to the benefit of
the petitioners, as such, the respondents cannot be
allowed to resile from the same. The offences
allegedly committed by the petitioners are
compoundable. In this view of the matter, this
petition is allowed and the above mentioned
criminal case against the petitioners is quashed with
the effect of petitioner’s acquittal on the basis of
compromise.

Announced.
