JUDGMENT
LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This appeal is
directed against the judgment
dated 25.06.2021 of the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-Ill/Judge Special Court/
Model Criminal Trial Court, Nowshera
delivered in case FIR No. 445 dated
25.08.2019 u/s 9 (c) of the Control of
Narcotics Substances Act, 1997 of Police
Station Risalpur, Nowshera whereby the
appellant has been convicted and sentenced
to life imprisonment with fine of
Rs.2,00,000/- or in default whereof to further
undergo one year SI. Benefit uls 382-B

Cr.P.C. was extended to him.

2. Brief facts of the case are that on
25.08.2019 Ayub Khan SHO of Police
Station Risalpur (PW-4) was on area

patrolling alongwith constable Tahir and
LHC Waheedullah when he received a spy
information to the effect that huge quantity of
contraband will be smuggled to Punjab
through Mazda vehicle bearing registration
No.LOT-7527. In order to foil the bid of
smuggling, he laid a barricade on the spot
when in the meantime the spotted vehicle
duly mentioned in the report arrived there
which was stopped. On query, the driver
disclosed his name as Shahid Nadeem son
of Muhammad Waryam r/o Mian Chano
district Khanewall. On search of the vehicle,
two plastic sacks were found lying in its
cabin. In one sack 5 packets of opium while
10 packets of chars in the other were found.
When weighed, total opium containing in the
5 packets turned out to be 4915 grams and
the chars as 9964 grams. From each
packet, 5/5 grams of opium and chars were
separated for the purpose of chemical
analysis. On the basis of ibid recovery,
complainant of the case drafted the murasila
(Ex.PA/1) which later on was incorporated

into the formal FIR Ex.PA.

3. After completion of investigation, the
case was put in court for trial which indicted

the accused for commission of the offence
to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed
trial. Prosecution in order to substantiate its
case produced and examined 7 witnesses in
all, whereafter statement of the accused was
recorded wherein he _ professed his
innocence. The learned trial court, after
conclusion of the trial, found him guilty of the
charge and while recording his conviction
sentenced him as mentioned above which

he has impugned through the instant appeal.

4. Arguments heard and record gone

through.

5. Though in the order to substantiate its
case, prosecution produced and examined
07 witnesses but from the contradictions in
the statements of the PWs, it appeared to
this court that the prosecution’s case against
the appellant is not free from doubt. The
major contradiction, which is not ignorable in
nature, can be seen in the statements of the
investigation officer (PW-1), the complainant
(PW-4) and in the testimony of marginal
witness to the recovery memo (PW-6). For
example, investigation officer of the case
has stated in his cross examination that the
murasila was sent to the police station

alongwith the accused and the case
property while contradicting him, the
complainant has stated in his cross
examination that only murasila was handed
over to constable Waheedullah alongwith
other documents for taking them to the
police station while the case property, the
vehicle and the accused were taken by him
to the police station and same is statement
of constable Waheedullah (PW-6).
Furthermore, Investigation Officer of the
case has admitted in his cross examination
that the site plan and statements u/s 161
Cr.P.C. of the witnesses were recorded on
his dictation by an ASI who was present with
him on the spot but his name, he didn’t
remember whereas the complainant and
marginal witness to the recovery memo
Ex.PW-4/1 (PW-6) have stated in their
depositions before the court that the
Investigation Officer through his own hand
writing had prepared the site plan and
recorded the statements of the PWs on the

spot.

6. Above-referred contradictions in the
statements of the prosecution witnesses are
neither minor in nature nor could be ignored

and same suggests that the occurrence had
not taken place in the mode and manner
narrated in the FIR and deposed by the
prosecution witnesses before the court. It is
well settled that in order to bring home guilt
in narcotic cases, prosecution must bring
reliable evidence in support of its charge
and it has held umpteenth time by the
superior courts that a single doubt in the
case against an accused would be sufficient
to acquit him instead of existence of series
of contradictions. No doubt, huge quantity of
contraband has been recovered in the case
alongwith the mazda vehicle but recovery of
huge quantity of narcotics is not the only
criteria to convict the accused charged with
trafficking of the contraband unless the
indictment is proved by the prosecution
beyond reasonable doubt through
confidence inspiring and worth reliable
evidence which is not the case in hand for

the contradictions mentioned above.

7. Thorough and careful examination of
the record would show that the learned trial
court has not appreciated the case evidence
in its true perspective and the conclusion

drawn by it are not borne out from the case
a

record for which the impugned judgment

cannot be upheld.

8. For what has been discussed above,
this appeal is allowed, conviction and
sentence recorded by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge-lll/Judge Special Court /
Model Criminal Trial Court, Nowshera
through the impugned judgment is set aside
and consequently the appellant is acquitted
of the charge levelled against him. He be set
at liberty forthwith if not required to be
detained in any other case.
