JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 01/11/2018

Appellant-Petitioner: Muhabat Khan  &
Amin sons of
Muhammad Sharif
Khan in Person.

Respondent: B udrat Ullah Khan
Gandapur, Asstt: AG.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.- This appeal is directed

against the judgment of learned Additional

Sessions Judge-II], Lakki Marwat dated

19/04/2018, whereby Cr. Appeal No.11, filed by

the appellant was dismissed by upholding the

judgment/ order dated 14/04/2018 of the learned

SCJ/Judicial Magistrate, empowered with Section

30 Cr.P.C, whereby bail bonds, furnished by the
-2-
appellants were forfeited to the State and they
were directed to pay a penalty of Rs.60,000/- each,
in default they shall undergo further SI in civil

prison for three months.

2. The petitioner stood sureties of one
Shafi Ullah an accused nominated in Crime
No, 401 dated 12.7.2013, registered U/Ss.
324/353 PPC r/w Section 13 AO registered at
PS Lakki District Lakki Marwat; but on failure
of the said accused to appear on the date fixed
for hearing, the learned trial Court cancelled
his bail, forfeited surety bonds directed the
petitioners to deposit the amount of Rs.60000/-
each as penalty out of amount of surety
Rs.80000/- vide order dated 14.4.2018 passed
by the learned Senior Civil Judge/Judicial
Magistrate empowered U/S. 30 Cr.P.C, Lakki
Marwat. Being aggrieved by the said order, the
petitioners filed criminal revision U/S. 435 &
439-A Cr.P.C instead of appeal U/S. 515
Cr.P.C, before the learned Sessions Judge,
Lakki, which was marked for disposal to the

Additional Sessions Judge-III, Lakki Marwat.

Azmat Awan * (SB) Justice Shakeel Ahmad*
-3-

Vide order dated 19.4.2018, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-III, Lakki Marwat

dismissed the same, hence, this appeal.

3. The petitioners contended that they
had stood surety for Shafi Ullah accused being
his uncle, purely out of benevolence, and they
got no benefit for this act. It was further urged
that the accused is wanted to the local police in
a murder case and has gone into hiding. They
made their best efforts to produce him, but in
vain and his whereabouts is not known to them.
They lastly contended that imposition of penalty
upon each petitioner is harsh and prayed for its

reduction.

4. The learned Asst: A.G appearing
on behalf of the State has got no objection on
reduction of penalty imposed upon the

petitioner.

5. I have considered the contentions of
the petitioners and have gone through the

record.

6. A plain reading of Section-515

Cr.P.C reveals that all orders passed by any

Azmat Awan * (SB) Justice Shakeel Ahmad*
-4-

Magistrate is appealable to the Sessions Judge
or if no appeal is preferred against any such
order, may be revised by the Sessions Judge suo
moto. In the instant case, the petitioner being
aggrieved by the order of the Judicial Magistrate
passed U/S. 514 Cr.P.C, filed criminal revision
before the learned Sessions Judge instead of
appeal as provided U/S. 515 Cr.P.C, and after
dismissal of criminal revision by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge, filed criminal
appeal. However, instead of going into
technicality, their appeal filed before the learned
Sessions Judge decided by Additional Sessions
Judge-III is treated as criminal appeal and this
appeal is treated as Criminal Revision in the

interest of justice.

7. Perusal of the record reveals that
the petitioners stood surety of the accused Shafi
Ullah out of benevolence and not for ulterior
motive or monetary gain, therefore, they are not
to be treated harshly nor punished severely
without there being extra ordinary
circumstances. The accused Shafi Ullah for

whom the petitioners had stood surety is fugitive

Azmat Awan * (SB) Justice Shakeel Ahmad*
-5-

from law in a murder case and as such it is
humanly not possible for the petitioners to
ensure his availability before the Court and
further taking into consideration financial
position of petitioners, I hold that forfeiture of
bonds, submitted by the petitioners to the extent
of Rs.60,000/- each shall be aggressive, hence,
the petitioners deserve leniency. In this behalf
reliance can be placed on the following

judgments:-

(1) Sardar Khan & others V. The
State 1969 P.Cr.L.J 447.

(2) Ghulam Haidar V Karim Bakhish
PLD 1963 SC 47.

(3) Muhammad Khan Vs The State
1986 P.Cr.L.J 2028.

(4) Bahadur Khan V The State 1976

P.Cr.L.J 1283 and
(5) Dilshad Alam V The State 2000
P.Cr.L.J 172.
8. Taking all the circumstances into

account, I consider that the amount of
Rs.60,000/- need not have been required from
them and that in all the circumstances their
default will be adequately punished by requiring

each of them to pay Rs.40,000/-, and this

Azmat Awan * (SB) Justice Shakeel Ahmad*
-6-

revision petition is allowed to that extent. The
bond shall be forfeited to the extent of

Rs.40,000/- each. Order accordingly.

Announced.
01.11.2018.
