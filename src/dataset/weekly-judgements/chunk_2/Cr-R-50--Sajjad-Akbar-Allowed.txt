JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 27.9.2021
Mr.Zulfigar Ali, Advocate for the petitioner.

Mr.Muhammad Inam Yousafzai, AAG for the
State.

LAL JAN KHATTAK, J.- This petition is
directed against the order dated 08.02.2021
of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-lll,
Mardan whereby the petitionerâ€™s application
for grant of exemption to him from his
personal appearance before the court has
been dismissed.

2. On 10.6.2018, one Muhammad ljaz
Khan lodged a report bearing FIR No.348
under section 324 PPC at Police Station,
Shahbaz Garhi of District Mardan wherein
he charged the petitioner for his firing at him.
The case was put in court for trial on
29.10.2018 and consequently the petitioner
was summoned who appeared before the
court on 31.01.2019 whereafter charge was
framed on 06.05.2019 to which he pleaded

not guilty. During pendency of the case,
petitioner, on 05.09.2019, moved an
application for exemption from his personal
appearance but before any decision could
come on his application he left the country
as a result non-bailable warrants of arrest
were issued against him and vide order
dated 18.07.2020, the exemption application
was dismissed. It reflects from the record
that thereafter on 10.10.2020, petitioner
appeared before the court and joined the
case proceedings. On 11.11.2020, he again
did not attend the court and consequently
NBW was issued against him for 08.02.2021,
on which date his father appeared before
the court and submitted an application for
grant of exemption to his son from his
personal appearance which application was
dismissed by the learned trial court through
the order impugned herein, hence, the
instant petition.

3. Arguments heard and appended
record gone through.

4. It reveals from the record that on
commencement of the trial, petitioner did
appear before the learned trial court and
denied the indictment. During pendency of
the proceedings, he moved an application

for grant of exemption to him from his
personal appearance before the court but
before passing any order on his application,
he left the country whereafter NBW was
issued against him. Consequently, he
appeared and remained before the learned
trial court for sometime but again left the
country without getting any permission from
the court. From perusal of the record, it
reveals that the petitioner did not appear
before the court for his not being in the
country and in his absence his father
attended the court and requested for grant
of some time to him so that his son could
come to the country. Ibid conduct of the
petitioner and his father amply shows that
they had due regard for the court and law.
No doubt, twice petitioner left the country
without getting any permission from the
court but his such non-appearance cannot
be taken like that of an absconder because
he left the country through a legal means
when he was on bail and had attended the
court for some time and also for livelihood
after arranging a visa against a colossal
amount. At abroad he is working as a driver,
per statement of his father before the court,
and thus he is lawfully earning for himself,

for his family and also sending remittances
to the country. Further, it is a known fact that
at abroad, the low paid employees are
always at the mercy of their employers.
They cannot return to their country on leave
unless complete a specific period with their
employers and their return also needs huge
amount for which the hapless employees
wait for years and years.

5. As for a lawful purpose and activity
the petitioner had left the country, had
returned his homeland earlier and appeared
before the court, therefore, his non-
appearance should have been condoned by
granting him exemption from his personal
appearance particularly when not only his
father was appearing before the court but he
was also represented before the court by his
lawyer.

6. Though under section 540-A Cr.P.C.
exemption from personal appearance can
be granted only when there are two or more
than two accused in the case and where the
accused physically appears before the court
and claim exemption but in suitable cases
exemption can be granted when there is
single accused before the court and even

when he is not physically present before the
court at the time of claiming exemption.
(Wisdom is sought from PLD 2004 SC 160).
7. For what has been discussed above,
this petition is allowed and on setting aside
the impugned order, the desired exemption
is granted to the petitioner from his personal

appearance before the court as prayed for.
