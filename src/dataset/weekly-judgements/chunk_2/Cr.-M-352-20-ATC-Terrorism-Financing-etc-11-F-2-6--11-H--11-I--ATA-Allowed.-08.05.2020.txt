JUDGMENT SHEET
Cr. M (Bail) No. 352-A/2020.

Date of hearing08.05.2020.

Petitioner/s (Qari Muhammad Arshad &
two others) byMr. Asjad Parvez Abbasi,
Advocate.

Respondents (State) by Mr. Muhammad
Muslim, Advocate/State Counsel.

AHMAD ALL J.Through this petition,
accused/petitioners namely Qari
Muhammad Arshad & two others seek
their release on bail, who are charged in
case FIR No.11 dated 21.12.2019 under
Sections!1 F (2)(6), 11H (2), 11i,
11J,11N of Anti-Terrorism Act, registered
at Police Station,CTD, Hazara
Division,Abbottabad. Earlier their plea
for post arrest bail was declined by the
learned Court below vide order dated:

27.04.2020.

2. Succinctly, the facts of the case as
narrated in the first information report are
that the complainant/SHO on 06.03.2019

in search of terrorists and their abettors
was on gust alongwith police nafri in the
area, where he_ received _ secret
information that organizations i.e Jamat-
ud-dawa and its sub-organization i.e
Falah-e-Insan-e-yat, which have already
been declared proscribed organizations
are involved in providing assistance to
terrorist, and that present
accused/petitioners being members of
said organizations have obtained certain
properties and in the garb of “work
ofpublic welfare’ they are using
Madrassas for financing the terrorism.

Hence, the instant FIR.

3. Arguments of learned counsel for
petitioners as well as learned State
counsel heard and record available gone

through with their valuable assistance.

4. Learned counsel for petitioners
argued that the accused/petitioners are
innocent and falsely charged in the case
as no direct or indirect evidence is
available on file to disclose that
accused/petitioners are involved in

terrorism financing. Further argued that
so-called confessional statements of
accused/petitioner available on file is
outcome of torture and undue influence
and that all the sections of law levelled

against them are also bailable.

5. On the other-hand learned State
counsel submitted that accused/petitioners
are involved in terrorist activities and in
the shadow of public welfare activities,
they are collecting money and financing
terrorism. He further argued that
accused/petitioners also recorded their
confessional statements, which supports

the version of prosecution.

6. Learned State counsel during
course of arguments mainly relied upon
the confessional statements of
accused/petitioners recorded during
investigation, before the Superintendent
of Police, CTD, Hazara _ Region,
Abbottabad. I have gone through each and
every confessional statement of
accused/petitioners available on _ file,
which reveal that petitioner were arrested

on 10.03.2020, and produced before the
competent Court on the next day i.e on
11.03.2020, who granted 07 days’ police
custody/remand of petitioners _ till
18.03.2020. On 18.03.2020
accused/petitioners were again produced
before the Court and their further police
custody was sought by submitting that on
18.03.2020,the accused/petitioners have
confessed their guilt before
Superintendent of Police CTD, Hazara
Division, Abbottabad.The said
confessional statements reveal that same
were recorded during police custody and
before the police and all were written
down in the same pattern and only 10+10
minute’ time provided to _ the
accused/petitioners to think over and
makeconfessions, which aspect of the
case makes the entire process of admitting
guilt by the accused/petitioners doubtful.

7. Perusal of confessional statements
alsoreveals that the control of Madrassas,
to whom the accused/petitioners were
managing, had already been taken over by

the provincial government and even their
employees are also being paid by the
government.Furthermore, the record as
well as the confessional statements
nowhere revealthat when, how and by
whomthe accused/petitioners used to get
aid/donations etc and through what source
same were being transferred to the banned
organizations and used for terrorist
activities. However, leaving aside all the
above discussion, the question that
whether the said confessional statements
were recorded without undue influence or
force etc or not, would’ be
seen/determined at the time of trial, as
same cannot be relied upon or discarded
at the bail stage.

8. Apart from the above,the offences
for which the accused/petitioners are
charged do not fall within the prohibitory
clause of section 497 Cr. P.C. For ease,
the relevant sections are reproduced

9. In Zafar Iqbal’s case(2009 SCMR
1488), a larger Bench of the august Apex
Court has explicitly expressed the
principles for considering the grant of bail,
where offences do not fall within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.
The said principles have consistently been
followed by the Honourable Supreme
Court, as it has been held in Riaz Jafar

Natiq’s case (2011 SCMR 1708) that:

“Thus keeping in view the law laid
down in the case of Zafar Iqbal v.
Muhammad Anwar and others
(2009 SCMR 1488) ordaining that
where a case falls within non-
prohibitory clause the concession
of granting bail must be
favourably considered and should
only be declined in exceptional
cases. We do not find this to be a
case where it should be refused as
an exception. Thus, this petition is
converted into an appeal and the
same is allowed and, resultantly,
the petitioner is admitted to bail
subject to furnishing bail bond in
the sum of Rs. 1,00,000 (Rupees
one hundred thousand only) with
two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of the
learned trial Court.”

Similarly, the august Apex Court, in
unequivocal terms held in Muhammad

Tanveer’s case (PLD 2017 SC 733) that:
“Once this Court has held in
categorical terms that grant of bail
in offences not falling within the
prohibitory limb of section 497,
Cr.P.C. shall be a rule and refusal
shall be an exception then, the
Courts of the country should follow
this principle in its letter and spirit
because principles of law
enunciated by this Court are
constitutionally binding on all
Courts throughout the country
including the Special Tribunals
and Special Courts.

Although in some special laws there
are specific provisions, limiting the
scope of section 497, Cr.P.C.
however, this Court in many
reported cases has laid down
binding principles that _ the
provisions of section 497, Cr.P.C.
shall not be ignored even in those
cases and the guiding
provisions/principles given therein
shall always be kept in mind while
considering the grant or refusal of
bail.

In this regard the case of The State
v. Syed Qaim Ali Shah (1992 SCMR
2192) and the famous case of Khan
Asfandyar Wali and others v.
Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2001
SC 607) are much relevant, where
principle of section 497, Cr.P.C. was
held to be applicable even to such
cases of course subject to slight
limitation.

We expect the Courts below to adhere
to these binding principles in future
and not to act mechanically in the
matter of granting or refusal of bail
because liberty of citizen is involved
in such matters, therefore, same
should not be decided in vacuum and
without proper judicial approach.”

10. At the moment, except the
confessional statements, there is no other
incriminating material/evidence is
available of file, which could prima
facieconnect the accused/petitionerswith

the commission of such heinous offence.
11. It has been held time and again by
the august Supreme Court that bail does
not mean acquittal of accused but only
change of custody from Government
agencies to the sureties, who on furnishing
bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required
to be produced. Reliance could be placed
on case reported in 2008 SCMR 807 “Haji
Muhammad Nazir Vs. State”.

12. The observations made hereinabove
are tentative in nature for the disposal of bail
petition and not intended to influence the
mind of trial Court, which is free to appraise
the evidence strictly in accordance with law
and merits of the case. In this regard the
august Supreme Court of Pakistan in Shuaib
Mehmood Butt Vs. Iftikhar-ul-Haq (1996
SCMR 1845) has rendered clear guidance,

which is to the effect that:-

“However we would like to point out
in no certain terms that the
observations made by the High Court
in the orders granting bail and by us
in this order are confined to tentative
assessment made for the purpose of

disposal of bail applications and not
10

intended to influence the mind of the
trial Court, which is free to appraise
the evidence strictly according to its
merits and the law at the time of
disposal of the case, which of course,
needless to say, is the function of the
trial Court”.

13. Therefore, this Court would not
withhold the concession of bail, at-least,
at this stage, as the accused/petitioners
have made out their case arguable for the
purpose of bail. Hence, the instant bail
petition is allowed. Accused/petitioners
be released on bail, provided they furnish
bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/-
(three lacs) each, with two sureties, each
in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learnedTrial Court/ Duty Judge, who
shall ensure that sureties are local,
reliable and men of means.

14. Above are the detailed reasons of
my short order of even date.

Announced.
