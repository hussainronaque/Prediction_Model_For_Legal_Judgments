{JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT]

Cr 3
“Mustajab-ul-Hassan vs. The State”
For appellant: - Mr. Ali Azim Afridi, Advocate.
For State: - Malik Akhtar Hussain, AAG.

Date of hearing: 03.08.2021
JUDGMENT
MUHAMMAD NAEEM ANWAR, L- Mustajab-ul-Hassan, the

appellant, through the instant appeal, filed under section 48

_of the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997, has

assailed the judgment dated 16.03.2021 of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge Special Court, Mardan
whereby, in the case of crime report No.1011 dated
09.09.2020 under section 9 (D) of KP CNSA, Police Station,
Hoti, District, Mardan, the accused facing trial namely Imad
Khan s/o Gul Muhammad r/o Mohallah, Akhtar Abad, Tangi,
District, Charsadda and Imtiaz s/o Mir Alam r/o Sikandari
Koroona, Par Hoti, District, Mardan, were acquitted,
however, the motorcar No.AKT-513-Islamabad was
confiscated to the State being unclaimed property through
Director General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Excise & Taxation
Department, Peshawar.

02. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that
just after registration of crime report No.1011 dated
09.09.2020 wherein, the above named accused were
involved, the appellant through his application No.122/4 of

2020 filed on 18.09.2020, approached to the Court of

learned Additional Sessions Judge-III, Mardan for superdari
of vehicle in question but his application was dismissed on
the ground that the motorcar in question was involved in
smuggling/transportation of huge quantity of narcotics
however, when through judgment dated 16.03.2021, the
accused named above, were acquitted of the charges but the
case property/motorcar in question was declared as
unclaimed property, which is against the mandate of section
32 & 33 of CNSA, 1997, especially, when the application of
petitioner was filed prior to submission of challan,
therefore, it was the duty of the learned trial Court to have
inquired about the ownership of motorcar in question. Next,
he argued that appellant is the registered. owner as it was
purchased by him on 19.09.2018 and was transferred in the

\ name of appellant on 31.12.2020.
03.

Malik Akhtar Hussain, learned AAG vehemently

opposed the contention of learned counsel for the appellant
by submitting that the appeal under section 48 of CNSA,
1997 is not maintainable as after promulgation of KP CNSA,
2019, the appeal should have been filed under the relevant
provision of law. He further contended that section 32 & 33
of CNSA, 1997 is also inapplicable to the controversy in
question as after promulgation of Act, 2019, section 34A &
34B have been inserted through KP Act No.XXVI of 2020. He

added that the registration of confiscated vehicle in

appellant’s name is also a question mark, being the case
property of FIR No.1011 dated 09.09.2020.

04. Arguments heard and record perused.

05. Though the prayer of the appellant in his appeal was
for the grant of vehicle in question after setting aside of
confiscation order however, learned counsel for the
appellant at the very outset, stated at the bar that on merits,
he does not want to press his appeal and confines himself to
the extent of legal question as the learned trial Court has
held that vehicle in question is unclaimed property of crime
report No.1011. Perusal of record reveals that the crime was
reported on 09.09.2020 whereas, the present appellant
approached to the Court of learned Additional Sessions
Judge, Mardan through his application dated 18.09.2020,
within a period of 10-days, by contending therein that he is
the purchaser of vehicle in question and that there is no
other rival claimant of it. Perusal of record reveals that on
07.01.2021, the accused of crime report No.1011 were
charge sheeted and trial was commenced. During trial,
statement of Mira Khan, Inspector/ OII, PS, Hoti, Mardan
was recorded as PW-2, who in his cross examination
deposed that “I have not made any effort regarding the
ownership of vehicle in question’. Proviso to section 34A

deals with the vehicle, vessel or any conveyance, being used

for the purpose of commission of offence, shall not be

confiscated unless it is proved that the owner knew that the
offence was being or to be committed, which reads as:

“Provided that no vehicle, vessel or other
conveyance shall be liable to confiscation
unless it is proved that the owner knew that
the offence was being, or was to be,
committed”.

06. The above reproduced proviso to section 34A is self-
explanatory, unambiguous, open only to one interpretation
that before confiscation it shall be proved that owner was in
the knowledge of offence so committed and if the
prosecution had proved it, the vehicle, vessel or conveyance
shall be confiscated. Likewise, section 34B deals with the
procedure for making confiscation, which reads as under: -

"34B. Procedure for making confiscation. -
(1) In the trial of offences under this Act,
whether the accused is convicted or
acquitted, the Special Court shall decide
whether any article frozen or seized in
connection with such offence is liable to
confiscation.

(2) Where any article seized under this Act,
appear to be liable to confiscation under
section 344A, but the person who committed
the offence, in connection therewith, is not
known or cannot be found, the Special Court
may inquire into and decide such liability
and may order confiscation accordingly;

Provided that no order of
confiscation of an article shall be made until
the expiry of one month from the date of
freezing or seizure or without hearing any
person who may claim any right thereto and
the evidence, if any, which he produces in
respect of his claim:

Provided further that if any such
article other than a_ narcotics drug,
psychotropic substance or controlled
substance is liable to speedy and natural
decay or in case of a vehicle, the Director
General or any other officer authorized by
him through notification in the official
Gazette, is of opinion that the sale of such
article or vehicle is for the benefit of its
owner, he may, with the approval of the
Special Court, after due notice to the owner

and by public auction, direct that the article
or, as the case may be, the vehicle be sold in
accordance with the rules made under this
Act and the sale proceeds shall be deposited
in Government Treasury for drug abuse till
the final judgment of the Special Court”.

07. First proviso of sub-clause 2 of section 34B make it
abundantly clear that no such property shall be confiscated
unless within one month from the date of freezing or seizer
any claimant thereto is given an opportunity of being heard
alongwith evidence if any pertaining to his claim. Record of
the case promulgates that neither 1.0. of criminal case has
collected any evidence nor issued any notice within a period
of one month after seizer of vehicle in question nor the
learned trial Court has made any effort in consonance with
the provision of section 34A & 34B of KP CNSA, 2019. When,
learned AAG was confronted with this legal aspect, he could
not wriggle out of the situation. Undoubtedly, the vehicle in
question has been registered in appellant's name, after its
seizer in crime report No.1011, however, the fate thereof
shall be determined by the learned trial Court in accordance
with the dicta laid down by the apex Court in case titled
“Amjad Ali Khan vs, The State & others” (PLD 2020 SC
357). It is pertinent to mention that first proviso of sub-
clause 2 of section 34B is not limited to the extent of owner
because the legislature has intentionally used the word “any
person” instead of “registered owner’ in first proviso of sub-
section 2 of section 34B so that the person may be the

registered owner or purchaser of vehicle through any

6

instrument but has not been registered as its owner yet, or
any person having any interest or claim thereto may
approach to the Court or entitles to be put on notice, in
order to prove his claim, if any, through evidence and till
then no such property shall be confiscated under section
34A. When, the petitioner has submitted the application for
superdari of vehicle in question within a period of 10-days
from the date of crime report, of course, he had got a claim /
regarding the property in question and was required to be |

served with a notice prior to submission of complete chailan

before the Court of competent jurisdiction by the seizing
officer/investigating officer, however, if during
investigation, 1.0 of the case has not served him with a
notice, as required in accordance with the above reproduced
ibid section, “the Court” after submission of complete challan
dk was required to serve the appellant with a notice about his
claim pertaining to the motorcar in question and by not
doing so, neither the seizing officer nor "the Court” has
complied with the legal requirements/formalities as
provided in section 34B of the Act of 2019. The proviso of
section 34A of the KP CNSA, 2019 and that of section 32 of
CNSA, 1997 is the same which provides that property used
in an offence under the ibid Act can only be confiscated
when it is established that the owner of the vehicle knew
that the offence was or being committed. It is a pre-requisite

for confiscation of the vehicle that whether a person has or

has not the knowledge of an offence, is a point of fact aud
was liable to be adjudicated upon in accordance with law in
normal procedure of dispensation of justice by putting the
owner or claimant on notice. Likewise, first proviso of sub-

section 2 of section 34B of the KP CNSA, 2019 and that of

CNSA, 1997 is one and the same. The Division Bench of this

Court in a case titled “Aamir Khalil vs. Government of

5 others” (PLD 2004 Peshawar 251) in connection with a
matter in which, the vehicle was confiscated to the State by
the Government functionaries and thereafter it was put to
auction, when it was challenged before this Court, has held:

“It is crystal clear from the first proviso to
subsection 2 of section 32 of the ibid Act that
vehicles shall not be liable to confiscation
unless it is proved that the owner thereof
knew that the offence was being or was to be
committed in respect of it while the
combined reading of first and second
provisos to sub-clause 2 of subsection 2 of
the ibid section places restriction on the
confiscation of an article before the expiry of
one month and that before confiscation
order the claimant must be given an
opportunity of hearing and that the Special
Court in case of an article which is subject to
speedy and natural decay may direct that it
be sold and the claimant may apply for the
receiving of the net proceeds of sale. Similar
rider is provided in sub-clause 3 of
subsection 2 conferring power on the
claimant to get set aside the order of
confiscation within a period of 30 days from
the date of order”.

08. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case
of “Abdus Salam vs, State” (2003 SCMR 246), “Alla Ditta
ys. The State” (2010 SCMR 1181) and in case titled “Amjad
Ali Khan ys. The State and others’ (PLD 2020 SC 299)

have thoroughly discussed and enunciated the principle of
law, especially in the case of Amjad Ali Khan that there are
certain restrictions for granting the vehicle on superdari
used in connection with the commission of an offence under
the Control of Narcotics Substance Act, 1997 however, in the
instant matter, the learned trial Court has held the vehicle in
question as “unclaimed”. The word “unclaimed” has not been
defined either in CNSA, 1997 or KP CNSA, 2019, nonetheless,
the simple meaning of “unclaimed property” is “the property
that an owner has given up all claims, possession and rights"
or “the property which it appears that the owner has
relinquished the rights and possession, for example, property
left intentionally in an empty lot and left as trash as an
abandoned property’. Thus, when on 18.09.2020, appellant
claimed himself to be the owner was entitled to be given a
notice by the seizing officer or by the Court for providing
him an opportunity of being heard pertaining to his claim
clinched with the vehicle in question by not doing so, the
learned trail Court has committed an illegality. Moreso, after
dismissal of his application, the appellate filed a criminal
appeal No.817-P/2020 under section 24 of CNSA, 2019,
however, the same was dismissed as withdrawn leaving the
appellate at liberty to file a fresh one but unfortunately, it
appears that prior to 26.03.2021, the learned appellate

Court has confiscated the vehicle in question through

judgment dated 16.03.2021.

09. Furthermore, the filing of appeal under section 48 of
CNSA, 1997 in fact was a misconception as the memo of
appeal reflects that on the same date, the appellant has
corrected it with the memo of appeal under section 24 of
CNSA, 2019. Even otherwise, wrong mentioning the proper
provision of law would not debar a person from seeking a
statutory remedy as provided under the law.

10. —_ In view of the above, the instant appeal to the extent
of confiscation of vehicle only is allowed, the judgment of
the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II/Judge Special
Court, Mardan vide which, the vehicle in question was
confiscated, is set aside and the case is remanded to the
learned trial Court to decide it after issuing a notice to the
appellant in view of proviso to sub-clause 2 of section 34A &
first proviso to sub-clause 2 of section 34B of the KP CNSA,

2019.
