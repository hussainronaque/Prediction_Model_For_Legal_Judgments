2. Precisely, the facts of the present case as
per record are that the complainant namely
Mst.Zohra Bibi resident of Stadium Road
Kurram Agency (then) residing at Badalzai
Colony, Sheikhul-Bandi Abbottabad (PW-12)
alongwith dead body of her husband namely
Yousaf Hussain lodged a report to Cadel
Abdul Ghafoor (then) SHO Police Station

husband was serving as Officer in WAPDA
and those days he was posted in Kohat and
were here at Abbottabad on leave. On that
date, on the eventful evening, they all family

near the house of Gul Zaman, unknown
persons by disseminating fear and terror made
indiscriminate firing with intent to murder him
as a result of which he died on the spot; she
further reported that they have got no enmity
with anyone and stated that the occurrence
seems to be in pursuance of sectarian
terrorism; voice of firing was also heard by the
inhabitants of nearby Abadi. She charged
unknown  culprit(s)/terrorist(s) for the
commission of offence. The said SHO
prepared the injury-sheet and inquest-report
(Ex.PW-15/1 and Ex.PW-15/2) of the
deceased and reduced the report of the
complainant into writing in shape of Murasila
(Ex.PA) and the same was sent to the Police

of the deceased. Though during the days of
occurrence he was in Islamabad in connection
with his studies, however, on information
being conveyed to him by his mother he came

and recoveries made them believed that his
father was murder by the accused and thus he

closed its evidence, statements of the
appellants were recorded under section 342
Cr.P.C before the learned trial court, wherein
they claimed innocence, however, they neither
wished to produce the defense evidence nor
desired to be examined as witness under
section 340(2) Cr.PC. Then after hearing
arguments of learned counsel for the parties,
the learned trial court vide order and judgment
dated 26.5.2022 convicted and sentenced the
appellants as mentioned in Para No.1 of this
judgment, whereas co-accused namely Raja
Mustafa Sultan was declared as a Proclaimed
Offender as he absconded during trial. The
three appellants have now called in question
their convictions and sentences recorded vide
the aforesaid order and judgment through the
aforesaid criminal appeals.

4. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties and learned Assistant Advocate
General were heard in detail and record

perused with their able assistance.

5. The main arguments of learned
counsel for the appellants were that the
impugned capital punishment has been
recorded against the appellants on the basis
of their delayed confessional statements
either before the Superintendent of
Police/PW-13 or before the court which
unreasonable delay casts serious doubt on
the voluntariness of the same. He further
argued that even the recovery of the pistol
from appellant Taimoor Faridoon and
sending the same to FSL alongwith
recovered empties has not been proved
beyond the doubt, therefore, the positive
Forensic Science Laboratory Report too is of
no benefit for the prosecution and thus the
learned trial court has wrongly awarded
capital punishment to the appellants. As
against this, learned counsel representing
complainant and learned Assistant Advocate
General submitted that the appellants belong

to the Proscribed Organization and they have

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
re

-14-

murdered the deceased in an organized
manner, therefore, they have rightly been
convicted and sentenced to death.

6. Before dilating upon the aforesaid
submissions of the learned counsel for the
parties, there is a consensus on both ends to
the effect that:-

i) In this case, there is no ocular or
direct evidence available,

ii) The appellants have been
awarded the capital punishment

(death) on the basis of:

(a) Their confessional statements
and

(b) Positive Report of FSL viz-a-
viz matching report of the
pistol and crime empties
recovered from the spot.

Thus in view of the above admitted
position, this court would proceed to analyze
and evaluate the prosecution evidence qua
the guilt or otherwise of the appellants.

7, It is the case of prosecution as

reported by Mst.Zohra Bibi/widow of the

deceased namely Yousaf Hussain (PW-12)

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
to the effect that her husband was serving as
Officer in WAPDA and during those days
he was posted in Kohat, however, on the day
of occurrence, he was at Abbottabad as he
was on leave. On that day, in the evening
time they all family members went to
Abbottabad city for shopping in the official
pick-up driven by her husband and then after
shopping her husband dropped them at their
rented house and after parking the vehicle at
WAPDA Colony, he was on way back to
home on foot when at about 7.30 p.m. he
reached at the place of occurrence, some
unknown persons made indiscriminate firing
at him due to which he died on the spot. She
further stated that they have got no enmity
with anyone, however, she apprehended that
the occurrence may be the result of sectarian
terrorism, therefore, she charged unknown
accused/terrorist(s) for the murder of her

husband.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

8. It is an admitted fact and as spelling out
from the record that initially nobody was
charged in the FIR as the instant FIR was
registered against the unknown persons,
however, at the very outset they were
suspected to be terrorists and the occurrence
was stated to be the result of sectarian
terrorism. The very foundation of the instant
case is a report (Ex.PA) which ultimately
culminated in FIR (Ex.PW-1/1) and contents
of the same have already been deciphered in
Para No.2 of this judgment from which it is
spelling and as admitted by the complainant
namely Mst.Zohra Bibi when she appeared in
the witness-box as PW-12 that she is not an
eyewitness of the occurrence meaning
thereby that the fact about the murder of
deceased at the alleged time and place is just
a hearsay evidence. She has further stated
during her cross-examination that she

charged the accused as during investigation

« IF

they were found involved in the commission
of offence. Apart from this, she did not bother
to mention in her report (Ex.PA) the source
through which she came to know about the
occurrence of her husband’s death, however,
during her court statement as PW-12 she
stated that their landlord came to her house
and informed her about the murder of her
husband. In view of above, there is no
coherence in the contents of the FIR (Ex.PW-
1/1) and statement of the complainant as PW-
12, which makes both of them as unreliable,
albeit, the learned trial court has completely
ignored such glaring lacuna in the
prosecution case while passing the impugned
judgment. Similarly, prosecution has neither
produced Tariq Zaman No.697 who carried
Murasila to the Police Station for registration
of case nor PW Khursheed Khan ASHO who
escorted the dead body from the spot to the

hospital for post mortem examination.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

9. Prosecution has not produced even a
single witness who could say that he has seen
any of the appellants near and around or at the
scene of the occurrence despite the fact that as
per site plan (Ex.PW-16/1) the occurrence
took place on the roadside which is
surrounded by thickly Abadi, so on the
available record there is no ocular or direct
evidence regarding the present occurrence as
well as the presence of appellants on the spot.

10. As far as the confessional statements of
the appellants are concerned, the record would
show that it was after two months and 17 days
of the occurrence when the present appellants
were arrested as suspects on 27.02.2017 and
on the next day ie. 28.02.2017 they were
produced before the Anti-Terrorism Court,
Hazara Division at Abbottabad and who was
pleased to grant six days of their police
custody. The record further shows that after
five days of police custody, one of the
appellants namely Taimoor Faridoon allegedly

recorded his confession statement on

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
05.03.2017 before the SP CTD/PW-13 but
when on the next day i.e. 06.03.2017 he was
produced before the Anti-Terrorism Court
where he refused to record a confessional
statement or to confess his guilt, therefore, he
was sent to the judicial lockup. As far as the
other two appellants namely Shahzad Kiyai
and Khalid Umer are concerned, as stated
hereinabove that when they were firstly
produced before Anti-Terrorism Court,
Abbottabad on 28.02.2017, six days police
custody was granted and as such on the
expiration of the aforesaid custody on
06.03.2017 they were again produced and one
day police custody was granted. The record
further indicates that on 07.03.2017 they were
again produced and a further two days police
custody was granted to the local police and it
was after three successive police custody
orders ranging from 28.03.2017 till
09.03.2017 when in the last phase of their
police custody they allegedly recorded their

confessional statements on 08.03.2017 before

SP CTD Hazara Abbottabad, however, when
on the next day when they were produced
before the Judicial Magistrate on 09.03.2017
they too refused to record their confessional
statements or to confess their guilt.

11. The record further indicates that the
Counter Terrorism Department / local police
after completing the investigation prepared a
complete challan on 05.04.2017 as available
on file, however, thereafter the trial of the
appellants could not be commenced as in the
meanwhile on 27.01.2018 the Federal
Government decided to hand over the
appellants to the Military Authorities. The
record further indicates that after 14 days of
their custody with the Military Authority they
were again produced by Major Nadeem before
Judicial Magistrate, Alpuri District Shangla on
09.02.2018 for recording their confessional
statements and who too has allegedly recorded

their confessional statements.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
a

In view of the above, on the available
record, there are confessions of the appellants
recorded under section 21-H of The Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997 by the Superintendent of
Police/PW-13 and lately in their custody
period there are confessional statements
recorded by the Judicial Magistrate, Alpuri
District Shangla, however, the aforesaid
confessional statements either recorded by SP
(CTD)/PW-13 or Judicial Magistrate,
Alpuri/PW-14 could not be relied upon for the

reasons highlighted hereinafter.

12. It is part of the record that the appellants
were arrested on 27.02.2017 and out of them
appellant Taimoor Faridoon has recorded his
confessional statement before the SP CTD
Hazara Abbottabad/PW-13 on the 5 day of
his custody, whereas appellant Shahzad
Kiyani and Muhammad Umar Khalid have
allegedly recorded their confessional

statements on the 12" day of their arrest and

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
ey ee

that too when three times successive police
custody was granted to the CTD Authorities,
therefore, such delayed recording of
confessional statements casts serious doubt on
their truthfulness and voluntariness and thus
no legal worth or sanctity or evidentiary value
could be attached to such confessional
statements as it prima facie shows that the
same have been extracted from the appellants
by the investigation officer just to provide
crutches to the prosecution case.

13. It is also relevant to mention here that in
this case, the prosecution has mainly relied on
the confessional statements recorded by SP
CTD/PW-13, however, it is noteworthy that
under Article 40 of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,
1984 any confession made before a police
officer is not admissible in evidence, however,
an exception has now been provided under
Section 21-H of The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997
where-under a confession made before a

police officer who is not below the rank of

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
vo

a Dau

DSP has been made admissible subject to pre-
existence of certain conditionalities. The same
section of law being relevant is reproduced

below:

‘21H. Conditional admissibility of
confession. Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Qanoon-e-Shandat,
1984 (President’s Order No. 10 of
1984) or any other law for the time
being in force, where in any court
proceedings held under this Act the
evidence (which includes
circumstantial and other evidence)
produced raises the presumption that
there is a reasonable probability that
the accused has committed the
offence, any confession made by the
accused during investigation without
being compelled, before a police
officer not below the rank of a
District Superintendent of Police, may
be admissible in evidence against
him, if the Court so deems fit.”

The language of the aforesaid provision
has been couched by the Legislature in such a
manner that it by itself speaks that a
confession before a police officer who is not
below the rank of District Superintendent of

Police would be admissible subject to certain

conditions and those conditions are that there

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
ye

must be some other circumstantial or other
evidence which are sufficient enough to
strongly raise the presumption that there is a
reasonable probability that the accused has
committed the offence and that for such
confession recorded during investigation, an
accused has not been compelled, however, if
the aforesaid yardstick is applied to the case
of present appellants it goes a long way to
discard the so-called confessional
statements recorded by the Superintendent
of Police/PW-13 at Abbottabad for the
reasons; firstly, that the same has been
extracted from the appellants after obtaining
the police custody as one of the appellants
namely Taimoor Faridoon has allegedly
confessed his guilt after five days of his
police custody, whereas the other two
appellants namely Shahzad Kiyani and
Muhammad Khalid Umer have confessed
their guilt after eight days of their police
custody which fact, prima facie, speaks

volume that appellants have been compelled

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
295%

for the same, therefore, the precondition as
required for the admissibility of a confessional
statement made before a police officer are
apparently missing in the present case,
therefore, the same could not be relied upon;
secondly, the certificates appended with the
aforesaid confessional statements would also
show that the SP CTD/PW-13 has specifically
stated that “the statement was recorded on my
own dictation”, which obviously means that
he has not recorded the confessional
statements in his own handwriting, however,
he has neither named that person who has
scribed these confessional statements nor the
LO. has recorded the statement of that scriber
of the confessional statements nor that scriber
has been produced by the prosecution to
establish that the confessional statements so-
recorded are in handwriting of the said scriber,
therefore, this illegality too goes a long way to
discard the so-called confessional statements
recorded by the aforesaid Superintendent of

Police.

14. The record also shows that after
recording of the aforesaid confessional
statements by Superintendent of Police (PW-
13), the appellants were again handed over to
the investigation officer rather the proper
course for him was to have sent them to the
judicial lockup, however, this act on the part
of aforesaid Superintendent of Police has
proved a blessing in disguise for the appellants
as on the very next day when they were
produced before the Judicial Magistrate, they
outrightly refused to record any confessional
statement. This fact alone is sufficient to
establish the fact that the so-called
confessional statements recorded by the SP
CTD is the result of coercions and compulsion
and are not the outcome of any repentance.
Had the appellants been repented then they
would have definitely confessed their guilt
before the Judicial Magistrate as well but

admittedly they did not, therefore, on this

Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
ey ae

score too, the confessional statements could
not be relied upon for recording the
convictions of the appellants.

15. It was also noted that in case of one of
the appellants namely Taimoor Faridoon,
the Superintendent of Police/PW-13 before
recording his confessional statement, has
not satisfied himself regarding the number
of days for which the said appellant has
remained in police custody as the answer to
the relevant question No.6 as transpired
from Ex.PW-3/2 is blank. Similarly, all the
appellants were promised by the said
SP/PW-13 as transpires from the question
No.2 of the questionnaire that the appellants
were asked that if they make a confession or
refuse to do so they will not be remanded to
police custody and will be sent to judicial
lockup, however, despite this promise and
commitment, the record would indicate

statements, they were again handed over to the
investigation officer, therefore, prima facie the
appellants have been induced by the SP/PW-
13 for extracting the alleged confessional
statements from them.

16. The record is also completely silent that
as to whether at the relevant time, the said SP
CTD namely Rizwan Habib/PW-13 was in
police uniform or was he in the plain clothes
though under the law he should have been
provided a conducive environment or for the
present matter a fearless or terror-less
environment to the appellants so as to attach a
legal worth to such confessions.

17. Inview of the above, it is established on
the face of record that the Superintendent of
Police/(PW-13) has not fulfilled all the codal
formalities either before, during or after
recording of confessional statements of the
appellants, therefore, such statements could
not be relied upon for the purpose of

conviction what to speak for the award of

capital punishment. In the case titled
“NADEEM HUSSAIN ys. The STATE”
reported as 2019 SCMR_ 1290, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court has observed that a confession
before the police is inadmissible in evidence
in normal cases but in cases of terrorism
section 21-H of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997
has made such a confession before the police
conditionally admissible. The condition placed
by the said section upon admissibility of such
a confession before the police is that there
must be some other evidence, including
circumstantial evidence, which must
reasonably connect the accused person with
the alleged offence before a confession made
by the accused person before the police is
accepted by a court worthy of any
consideration. Such conditional admissibility
of a confession before the police is contingent
upon availability of some other evidence
connecting the accused person with the

alleged offence but in the present case, as we

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-30-

have already discussed above, all the other
pieces of evidence relied upon by the
prosecution against the appellant had utterly
failed to connect the appellant with the alleged
offences. Similarly, way back in the year
1998, the Apex Court in the case titled

“MEHRAN ALI and others vs FEDERATION

OF PAKISTAN and others” reported as PLD

1998 Supreme Court 1445, has declared the
erstwhile section 26 of The Anti-Terrorism
Act, 1997 now section 21-H of the ibid Act as
ultra-vires and in violative of Articles 13(b)
and 25 of the Constitution and it had been
recommended that the words occurring in

section 26 of the Act “police-officer not below

the rank of a Deputy Superintendent_of
Police” be suitably amended with the words
“Judicial Magistrate” and it was held that
section 26 of the Act in that form was not a
valid law as the same is violative of Articles
13(b) and 25 of the Constitution. This court in

the case titled “AFTAB AHMAD ys THE

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-31-

STATE” reported as 2004 MLD 1337, has also
allowed criminal appeal against conviction
and sentence recorded by the trial court by
observing that since the decision about its
admissibility in view of section 21-H of the
Act mentioned above has been left on the
judicial discretion of the Court, the Court
before relying upon it must see and satisfy
itself whether the questions enumerated above
have been satisfactorily answered. If the
answers are in the affirmative, alright it can be
relied upon. But if in the negative as in this
case, it will neither be credible nor even
relevant. Needless to say that being admissible
does not necessarily mean being credible.

18. As far as the confessions of appellants
before Judicial Magistrate, Alpuri District
Shangla/PW-14 are concerned, the same too
could not be considered for the purpose of
impugned capital punishment as it is an
admitted fact that the present appellants were

arrested on 27.02.2017 as potentially suspects

of the present occurrence and then they were
handed over to the Military Authority exactly
after 11 months i.e. on 27.01.2018 and then
after 13 days of custody with Military
Authority statedly they were produced by one
Major Nadeem before the Judicial Magistrate,
Alpuri District Shangla (PW-14) and who
recorded the confessional statements of the
appellants, however, these so-called judicial
confessions too, could not be relied upon for
this sole reason that these confessional
statements were recorded after eleven months
of their arrest by the local police and after 13
days of their custody with the military
authority.

19. The record also indicates that after
handing over of the appellants to the military
authority on 27.01.2018 till the date of
recording of their confessional statements on
08.02.2018 they were admittedly not under a
legal and lawful custody which was duly

granted by a competent military authority or

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
SL

any Magistrate as the case may be and thus a
confessional statement recorded during an
illegal custody of an accused person could not
be considered what to speak of relying the
same for the grant of capital punishment. In
the case titled “STATE ys. ASFANDYAR

WALI and 2 others” reported as_ 1982 SCMR

321, the Apex Court has observed that the
prosecution relied on his confession, and as
submitted by the learned Advocate-General,
the Special Court relied on the confession,
because it was highly impressed by the
evidence of the Magistrate, who recorded it.
But, the Magistrate, who recorded _ this
confession, was also a probationer, and we
cannot understand the coincidence by which
confessions in a case of crucial importance
were recorded only by Magistrates who were
probationers and that in a city as big as
Peshawar. Be that as it may, the circumstances
in which Nisar Khan's confession was

recorded are similar to those in which

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-34-

Asfandyar's confession was recorded. Nisar

Khan had been in custody for more than a

month when his confession was recorded, and

the learned Advocate-General did not explain

how he had been kept in custody for so long
without a remand order by a Magistrate. And,
we would emphasize here that no_remand
order _was produced before us. Additionally,
and this is more shocking, Nisar Khan was
produced from the dungeons of the grim
fortress of Balahisar for recording his
confession, yet the Magistrate did not make
any enquiry as to whether the accused had
been ill-treated or not. Therefore, for the
reasons, which we have already given, we are
not impressed by the confession, and we hold
that it was neither genuine nor voluntary.

20. It was also noted during perusal of
confessional statements of appellants recorded
before Judicial Magistrate, Alpuri Shangla
(which are available on file as Ex.PW-14/1,
Ex.PW-14/4, Ex.PW-14/7 and Ex.PW-14/10)

that each of the confessional statements

consists of two sheets, however, it has neither
been mentioned on any page thereof that these
statements have been recorded under section
164 Cr.PC nor any provision of Army
Act/Law is cited nor there is signature or
stamp of the concerned Judicial Magistrate on
their first page nor there is signature or thumb
impression of the respective appellant on first
page nor name of the concerned appellant is
written on the second page thereof, which
infirmity in the confessional statements not
only lessens their sanctity in the eye of law but
also renders first page of the same bearing no
signature or stamp of the concerned Judicial
Magistrate as well as for want of signature or
thumb impression of the concerned appellant
as inadmissible. In the case reported as 2019

SCMR_ 1290, which has already been cited

above, the Hon’ble Supreme Court did not
believe the confessional statement by

observing that the said confessional statement

attributed to the appellant was not signed _or
thumb-marked by the appellant.

21. In view of the above discussion, the
aforesaid confessional statements recorded
after considerable delay could neither be
termed as true nor voluntary nor the same
could be termed as recorded without any
compulsion or pressure or coercion or
influence or inducement nor the same have
been recorded after observance of all the codal
formalities as find mentioned in the High
Court Orders and Rules or judicially approved
norms as set by the Higher Judiciary from
time to time, therefore, the same could not be

relied upon. In the case titled “The STATE

through P.G. Sindh and others vs. AHMED

OMAR SHEIKH and others” reported as

2021 SCMR 873, the Apex Court has held that

keeping them in such long detention clearly
made both the retracted judicial confession
doubtful _and_non-voluntarily. It was further
held by the Apex court in that case that

admittedly their statements were recorded

with a delay of more than 17/18 days of their

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-37-

illegal confinement. Such long detention that
too illegal, is sufficient to discard the

confessional statements as the principle that

longer police custody of an accused lesser the

evidentiary value of his confession, will apply

in this case. This delay has not been explained
by the prosecution. All the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the prosecution were
unable to explain as to why such confessions
were not recorded on the day first of their
arrest. From the perusal of the confessional
statement of both the accused we are satisfied
that the fear of police was not removed from
the mind of the accused and the confession
made by them is not free from extraneous
influence such as threat, promise or
inducement. The confessional statements were
not made voluntarily and suffer from various
defects and infirmity as noted by us and
confessional statements have been retracted
which are also enough to make them

involuntarily and diminish its intrinsic value.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

Similarly, in another case titled “INTEKHAB
AHMAD ABBASI and_ others vs. THE

STATE and others” reported as 2018 SCMR

495, the Honourable Supreme Court allowed
all the three appeal and acquitted all the
appellants by observing that considering the
case in the above background, it would be fair

to draw an inference that the accused were

coerced and pressurized to make confession

after remaining in the custody of the J.LT. for

many weeks blind foldedly at __unknown

places. Similarly, this court by following the
aforesaid dictum of the Apex Court has

already held in the case titled “ADIL KHAN

ys. The STATE and_ another” reported as

2020 PCr.LJ 729 that confession recorded with

a delay of 4 days after arrest with no plausible
explanation and such undue delay cannot be
made basis for recording conviction of
accused on capital charge. Longer the custody
of accused weaker the evidentiary value of

confession.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

22. Even otherwise, the appellants did not
stick to the so-called confessional statements
rather they retracted from the same at the stage
of investigation, during the trial as well as at
the time of recording their statements under
section 342 Cr.PC before the trial court,
therefore, on this ground alone, these retracted
confessions could not be made basis for the
impugned capital punishment. In the case

titled “MUHAMMAD BILAL and _ another

vs. The STATE and others” reported as 2021

SCMR 1039 the Apex Court has acquitted the
appellant by observing that another important
aspect of the case is that the appellant had
retracted the confession and claimed that he
had not made any incriminating statement.
Thus, in such a situation, the only evidence to
be relied upon is the said retracted confession
and no other reliable and trustworthy evidence
is available with the prosecution. This further
compels the prosecution to establish and prove

the confessional statement which we think the

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 40 -

prosecution has badly failed to prove beyond
any reasonable doubt. It would be highly
unsafe to maintain conviction on such a
sketchy retracted confession.

23. Another flaw as discussed hereinabove
that in this case the scriber of the confessions
was not produced despite the fact that the
Superintendent of Police (PW-13) has
recorded certificates (Ex.PW-13/3 and
Ex.PW-13/7) that the confessional statements
were recorded on his dictation which
obviously means that these statements are not
in his own handwriting and that who is the
scriber of these confessional statements has
neither been named nor produced by the
prosecution before the court as its witness.
This court in the case titled “ALI

REHMAN and another vs The STATE

through Additional Advocate General and

3 others” reported as 2021 YLR-Notes

118 acquitted the appellant by observing

that the Judicial Magistrate has also not

Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
ae

aA]

clarified in his statement that in what manner
he had asked the questions mentioned in
memorandum of inquiry through his Reader
and how he read over the confession to
appellant/convict, therefore, it cannot be
ascertained from the available record that the
appellant understood the nature and
significance of the questions put to him by
Judicial Magistrate before recording his
confession. Though the Judicial Magistrate
has stated that he had handed over the
appellant to Naib Court, however, the I.O. has
admitted in his cross-examination that the
appellant was handed over to him at 13:00

hours. In the case titled “MUHAMMAD

ISMAIL vs. The STATE” reported as 2017

SCMR 713, the Apex Court has summed up all
the prerequisite legal formalities as well as
condationalities for a confession on the basis
of which the same could be relied upon for the
purpose of conviction and the same are

reproduced below:

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

“The most important factors and
required standards of confession
may be cited below:-

"It should be ensured,

(i) that the accused is in full
senses and understands the
consequences of making a
confession;

(ii) that, the confession was not
a result of any duress,
coercion or any promise by
the prosecution, to be made
an approver;

(iii) that, during transit of the
accused by the police from
and to the Trial Court from
the prison, on each "Paishi"
no threat or pressure was
applied by the escorting
police guard or incharge
thereof;

(iv) what were the actual facts,
which induced the accused
to confess after facing trial,
during which he pleaded
innocence all the way;

(v) the court recording the
confession has to ensure that
the mental capacity of the
accused is not diminished
due to any illness and if
some indication of
abnormality is suspected by
the Court, it is better to refer
the accused to the Standing
Medical Board to ascertain
the true cause thereof;

(vi) While recording the
confession, the same
safeguards and precautions
be adopted, by directing the
Public Prosecutor, the

complainant's counsel, the
Naib Court and all other
officials to leave the Court.
If need be, the counsel who
represents him, may be
given an opportunity to be
present inside the Court
during the whole process, if
the accused person, on
asking by the Trial Judge, so
demands;

(vii) the handcuffs of the accused
be removed and he be
provided a chair on the dais.
He may be given some time
to think over the making of
the confession and in that
regard particular questions
be put to him, as to why he
was making the confession
when he has already pleaded
innocence and claimed trial
at the time, the formal
charge was framed;

(viii) the Trial Judge shall explain
to the accused that, in case
of making confession, he has
to face a capital sentence in
a murder case or any offence
punishable with death;

(ix) the entire record of all the
questions and answers
recorded, be properly
maintained and thereafter, a
proper certificate be
appended thereto, showing
the satisfaction of the Trial
Judge that the accused
person was not mentally sick
and he was making the
confession voluntarily,
based on true facts and that,
there was no other
compelling reason behind
that.

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-44-

The Apex Court in the aforesaid
case has further held that as the
above procedure was not adopted,
therefore, it was incorrectly
construed by the Courts below as
confession of the accused. Under
the law, it may be treated as an
admission of the appellant,
however, on the basis of admission
alone, accused person cannot be
awarded a capital punishment
because admission, as has been
defined by Article 30 of the Qanun-
e-Shahadat Order, 1984, is only a
relevant fact and not a proof by
itself, as has been envisaged in
Article 43 of the Order, 1984,
where a proved, voluntary and true
confession alone is held to be a
proof against the maker therefore,
both the Courts below have fallen
in error by treating this halfway
admission to be a confession of

guilt on the part of the appellant.”

24. As far as the other incriminating
evidence/material which was found weighed
with the learned Anti-Terrorism Court for the

grant of capital punishment was the recovery

Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-45-

of pistol from appellant Taimoor Faridoon and
the same being the ownership of co-appellant
Shahzad Kiyani and the positive Forensic
Science Laboratory (FSL) Report qua
matching the recovered empties with the
pistol, however, such positive Report of
Forensic Science Laboratory too is of no
benefit for the prosecution as the record would
show that allegedly four empties of pistol
without mentioning of their bore, were shown
recovered from the spot vide recovery memo
Ex.PW-8/1 and similarly in the site plan
Ex.PW-16/1, the empties were shown
recovered from point “A”, however, there too,
the bore of the same was not mentioned and
when the marginal witness of the said
recovery memo Ex.PW-8/1 namely Khan Gul
appeared in the witness-box as PW-8 who too
in the cross-examination has destroyed this
important piece of prosecution evidence by
stating that “J do not know what the police

officials did with the empties after securing

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
~~

alli

them. Anyhow I do not know it was placed in
paper or cloth (leer) after securing from the
spot.” and more astonishingly he has also
stated that “Jn my presence 1.0. did not initial
the empties.” The aforesaid categorical
statement of one of the important marginal
witness of the recovery would manifestly
show that the empties were not sealed on the
spot and thus they were left unsecure and
unsafe, therefore, this fact alone is sufficient
to cast a serious doubt on the safe custody and
safe transmission of the empties to the FSL,
and thus the positive Report of FSL is of no
legal worth for the prosecution. In the case

titled “RAHIM BAKHSH ys. The STATE”

reported as 2010 PCr.LJ_ 642 [Quetta], it was

observed that as far as non-sealing of
recovered articles is concerned, there is no
cavil with the legal proposition that non-
sealing of alleged recovered weapons on the
spot vitiates conviction. Moreover, it is clear

that alleged recovered articles at any stage of

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
we

=f7ie

time were never sealed, so in my considered
view, this circumstance itself is sufficient
enough to vitiate trial.

25. It may also be noted that after the
recovery of four empties of pistol from the
spot on 10.12.2016 they were sent to Forensic
Science Laboratory on 14.12.2016 and the
FSL Report was prepared on 03.01.2017 and
the same was received back by the I.O. on
10.01.2017. All these crucial dates are duly
reflecting from the FSL Report Ex.PW-16/15,
however, as per prosecution case, the pistol
was allegedly recovered on pointation of the
appellant Taimoor Faridoon on 02.03.2017
then the aforesaid pistol alongwith the
recovered empties were jointly sent to the
Forensic Science Laboratory on 06.03.2017
but the record is completely silent that as to in
whose custody these empties remained from
10.01.2017 (when they were received from the
FSL) till 06.03.2017 (when they were again

sent to the FSL alongwith the recovered

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
- 48 -

pistol). The prosecution has neither produced
nor exhibited Register No.19 pertaining to the
safe custody of the case property in the
Malkhana nor any of the prosecution
witnesses has stated a single word that during
this long period of 54 days ie. from
10.01.2017 to 06.03.2017 in whose custody
these empties remained, therefore, such
positive Report of the Forensic Science
Laboratory too is of no significance. In the

case titled “MUHAMMAD BILAL and

another vs. The STATE and others”

reported as 2021 SCMR 1039, the Apex Court

has observed that the pistol was allegedly
recovered from the immediate possession of
the appellant vide card of arrest Ex.PW2/1 at
the time of his arrest by S.I. Iftikhar Shah
(PW.2) on 2nd August, 2016 but there is

nothing on the record to show that in whose

custody it remained from the time of its
alleged recovery on 2nd August, 2016 till 4th

August, 2016... Besides the above, the empty

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.

- 49 -

and the pistol were sent together vide Ex.PW-

7/6 to Forensic Science Laboratory, Khyber

Pakhtunkhwa (FSL) on 8th August, 2016. The
report of the Fire Arms Expert is Ex.PK/1. In

these circumstances, positive report becomes

highly doubtful_and_can_in_no way be

considered as a piece of corroborative

evidence worth reliance. Similarly, in the case

titled “MUHAMMAD SALEEM v. SHABBIR

AHMED and others” reported as 2016 SCMR
1605, the Apex Court has observed that none
had seen respondent No.1 firing at the
deceased and, thus, mere recovery of a
weapon of offence matching with a crime-
empty was not sufficient to provide
corroboration to the other pieces of

circumstantial evidence. It had never been

proved before the trial court that the weapon
of offence had been kept in the Mal Khana
safely after its recovery and its dispatch to the
Forensic Science Laboratory was also not

proved by any witness. For all these reasons

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-50-

the High Court had concluded that the
prosecution had failed to prove its case against
respondents Nos.1 and 4 beyond reasonable
doubt and had, thus, acquitted the said
respondents of the charge. Likewise, in

another case titled “NOOR MUHAMMAD ys.

THE STATE and another” reported as 2010

SCMR 97, the Apex Court has held that the
recovery of crime empty or rifle with
matching report of F.S.L. is at the most a
corroborated piece of evidence and the same
by itself is not sufficient to convict the
accused in the absence of the substantive
evidence.

26. It is also quiet astonishing that even the
prosecution has not been able to_prove the
sending of these empties and pistol to the FSL
as in support of sending the empties/pistol to
the FSL they have produced Sohrab Khan ASI
CTD as PW-9, however, he has admitted in
his cross-examination that he got dispatched

the case property in parcel No.5, 6 and 7

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
aS pe

through his “Assistant”, however, he has
neither named the said “Assistant” nor he has
been produced as a_ witness. Similarly,
regarding the road certificates, which were
exhibited as Ex.PW-5/1 and Ex.PW-5/2, he
has admitted that they were scribed by his
“predecessor-in-office”, however, the said
“predecessor-in-office” of PW-9 has neither
been named nor produced by the prosecution
as its witness, therefore, the very sending of
empties and pistol to the FSL has not been
established by the prosecution.

27. As far as the case of prosecution against
appellant Shahzad Kiyani is concerned to the
effect that the said pistol was his licenced
pistol and was duly registered in his name, this
fact too has not been established by the
prosecution as the record would show that the
copy of the license of the said pistol was taken
into possession vide recovery memo Ex.PW-
2/4 and as per the aforesaid recovery memo

this license copy of the pistol was produced by

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon’ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
2§2=

the “close relative” of the appellant Shahzad
Kiyani, however, the said “close relative” has
neither been named nor his statement has been
recorded by the I.O. nor he has been produced
in the court in support of the same, therefore,
the very production of the license copy of the
pistol on behalf of appellant Shahzad Kiyani is
not proved as per required standard of proof.

28. The record also shows that the
prosecution has neither been able to produce
the original copy of the license of the pistol of
appellant Shahzad Kiyani nor it has bothered
to verify its authenticity and genuineness /
correctness from the licensing authority to the
effect that as to whether the same is a valid
licence and that the same is truly a registered
pistol in the name of appellant Shahzad Kiyani
or not, therefore, this flaw in the prosecution
case too goes a long way to doubt their
allegation that the pistol so recovered is
registered in the name of appellant Shahzad

Kiyani.

29. The record also shows and as stated
hereinabove that at the time of recovery of
four empties, their bore have not been
mentioned in the recovery memo nor the same
has been mentioned in the site plan and this
unprecedented non-mentioning of the bore of
empties strongly shows that the investigation
officer has left the field open for himself to fill
the same after the recovery of weapon of
offence and thus this malafide on the part of
1.0. too speaks volume that the 1.0. has gone
to every extent to cook up a strong case
against the appellants.

30. In view of the above discussion when
the prosecution has not been able to prove that
the empties were sealed on the spot and that
the pistol was registered in the name of
appellant Shahzad Kiyani then recovery of the
pistol from appellant Taimoor Faridoon and
the same being the ownership of the appellant
Shahzad Kiyani and then positive report of

FSL would be of no help for the prosecution

and thus the same alone could neither be
sufficient nor the same could be relied upon
for the purpose of conviction.

31. It is also relevant to mention here that it
is the case of prosecution right from day one
that the appellants belong to a Proscribed
Organization namely —§ Sipah-e-Sahabah
Pakistan, and that they have committed the
murder of deceased Yousaf Hussain as a result
of sectarian motivation, however, prosecution
has not been able to bring on record an iota of
evidence to prove that either the appellants
have solicited or invited support for a
Proscribed Organization or they have provided
any money to it or that the appellants have
printed or published any material to invite any
religious, sectarian or ethnic hate or that they
are the office-bearers of the said banned
Organization or that they are registered
members of the said Organization or that they
have a history of any suchlike activities in the

past. During the course of arguments, learned

that in the past the name of one of the
appellants has been included in Schedule IV
of The Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, however,
those materials on the basis of which the name
of one of the appellants was enlisted in
Schedule IV of the said Act have not been
brought on the case file, therefore, the
allegation of the prosecution qua appellants
being members of a Proscribed Organization
remained allegations throughout and no
positive, convincing and confidence inspiring
evidence has been brought on record to
establish the said allegations, therefore, on this
score too, they have wrongly been convicted
under various provisions of The Anti-
Terrorism Act, 1997.

32. So far as the allegations of conspiracy
being hatched by the appellants for the murder
of a person who practiced Shia Sect is
concerned, the said allegations too have not

been established on record as in support of

the same, the prosecution has not produced a

case, Nokia mobile phone having IMEI
No.35891107373572 was allegedly used by
appellant Taimoor Faridoon at the time of
occurrence by using SIM number of his father
0316-5130789, and allegedly the same was
recovered from one Muhammad Pervez who
found the same being left by someone in his
Taxi but astonishingly during trial the said
Muhammad Pervez was not produced by the
prosecution. In this backdrop of the matter, i2
flow chart (Ex.PW-16/19) becomes doubtful
as the aforesaid SIM number was not in the
name of appellant Taimoor Faridoon rather it
was registered in the name of his father (as
stated by PW-2 in his court statement) and
thus the chain and nexus amongst the
appellants qua hatching of a conspiracy is not
established by the prosecution. Likewise, the
prosecution has failed to bring on record
anything in black and white with respect to
conversations amongst the appellants for

chalking out a murderous plan as well as for

its execution just prior to the instant
occurrence. Even otherwise, i2 flow chart
(Ex.PW-16/19) on which the learned trial
court has heavily relied, neither deciphers the
IMEI numbers of the mobile phones in which
the SIMs numbers shown therein were
allegedly used nor the exact location of the
deceased and appellant Taimoor Faridoon
rather the words “Sipah Sahaba’ in bracket
are written with the names of appellants which
aspect of the case casts serious doubt on its
genuineness as the I.O. was required to have
obtained the said data without mentioning
those words of “Sipah Sahaba” and thus it
appears that the data providing entity has
apparently been influenced by these words of

the I.O. In the case reported as 2021 SCMR

873, which has already been cited above, the
Apex Court has also observed that to
constitute a criminal conspiracy under section
120-A, P.P.C. two essential elements are
required to be proved: (i) intent to do or cause

to be done an illegal act, or an act which is not

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon’ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
a 5¥

illegal but by illegal means; (ii) existence of a
conspiratorial agreement. Realizing the
clandestine nature of the offence, the
legislature has employed a special rule of
evidence, as provided under Article 23 of the
Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. The said rule is an
exception to the general rules of proof. This
rule provides that there should be ‘reasonable
ground’ that a person was a party to the
conspiracy before his acts, statements or
writings can be used against his co-

conspirators. Mere association of a person

with a conspirator or even a serious suspicion

of one’s involvement with the other is not

Or ON 5 HIV eee eS eee

sufficient to constitute ‘reasonable ground’ for

the former to be in conspiracy with the latter.

The Apex Court in another para of the said
judgment has further observed that the only
evidence to link Salman Saqib with the crime
is the confession of the co-accused Fahad
Naseem. This single piece of evidence could
not be more than circumstantial evidence, and

would not alone, suffice to prove that Salman

Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.
-59-

Saqib is guilty of committing criminal

conspiracy to abduct Daniel Pearl for ransom.
Convicting a person solely on the basis of the
confession of a coconspirator on the strength
of Article 23 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984
would surely run counter to the settled
principles of safe administration of criminal
justice enshrined in Article 37 (supra). Thus,
when the judicial confession of Salman Saqib
has been legally discarded, then there remains
no reliable evidence, other than mere
suspicion of him being part of the conspiracy.
This being so, the condition precedent of there
being ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ Salman
Saqib was part of a conspiratorial agreement,
as envisaged under Article 23 of the Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 1984 was starkly _ lacking.
Accordingly, the statements, writings or

actions of Fahad Naseem could not implicate

Salman Saqib to be part of the criminal
conspiracy, within the contemplation of
Article 23 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. In

these circumstances, one can safely conclude

(Jamil) (D.B.) Hon'ble Mr.Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel.
Hon'ble Mr.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan.

that the prosecution did not produce sufficient
trustworthy evidence to prove the charge of
criminal conspiracy against Salman Saqib.

In view of the above discussion and
expositions of law, the case of prosecution is
full of doubts all around and it has miserably
failed to prove the allegations as levelled
against the appellants, therefore, benefit of the
same has to be extended to them not as a

matter of grace but as a matter of right.

33. It is relevant to mention here that by
now it is a trite law that that for giving benefit
to an accused, it is not essential that there
should be many circumstances creating
doubts, even a single doubt is sufficient to
extend its benefit to an accused person as it is
the cardinal principle of — criminal
administration of justice that let hundred
guilty persons be acquitted but one innocent
person should not be convicted. The

Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in the

case titled “AMIR MUHAMMAD KHAN vs
The STATE” reported as 2023 SCMR_ 566,
has held that it is a well settled principle of
law that for the accused to be afforded this
right of the benefit of the doubt, it is not
necessary that there should be many
circumstances creating uncertainty and if
there is only one doubt, the benefit of the
same must go to the accused. Same norm
was settled by the Apex Court in the case

titled “SAGHIR AHMAD ys The STATE and

others” reported as 2023 SCMR_ 241.

Similarly, in the case titled “BASHIR
MUHAMMAD KHAN ys The STATE”

reported as 2022 SCMR_986, the august

Supreme Court has held that single
circumstance creating reasonable doubt in a
prudent mind about the guilt of accused makes
him entitled to its benefits, not as a matter of
grace and concession but as a matter of right.
The conviction must be based on

evidence. Any doubt arising in prosecution's
case is to be resolved in favour of the accused
and burden of proof is always on prosecution
to prove its case beyond reasonable shadow of
doubt. Similarly, in the case titled “KHALID
MEHMOOD alias KHALOO vs The STATE”
reported as 2022 SCMR 1148, the Apex Court
has reiterated the same rational by observing
that in these circumstances, a dent in the
prosecution's case has been created, benefit of
which must be given to the appellant. It is a
settled law that single circumstance creating
reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. In another

case titled “KASHIF ALI alias KALU ys.

The STATE and another” reported as 2022

SCMR 1515, the Apex Court has held that it is

settled law that a single circumstance creating

reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the
guilt of accused makes him entitled to its
benefits, not as a matter of grace and
concession but as a matter of right. The
conviction must be based on unimpeachable,
trustworthy and reliable evidence. Any doubt
arising in prosecution case is to be resolved in
favour of the accused. Reliance in this behalf

can be made upon the following cases:-

i) Tariq Pervez _v. The State
(1995 SCMR 1345),

i) Ghulam Qadir and 2 others
v. The State (2008 SCMR

1221),
iii) Muhammad_Akram_v. The

iv) Muhammad_Zaman_v. The

State (2014 SCMR 749) and
vy) Muhammad_Mansha_v_The

State” (2018 SCMR 772).

34. For what has been discussed above,
we are of the firm view that the prosecution
has miserably failed to prove its case against
the appellants beyond shadow of reasonable
doubt. Resultantly, all the three aforesaid
appeal are allowed, the convictions and

sentences of the appellants recorded by the

Division, Abbottabad through the impugned
judgment dated 26.05.2022 are set aside and
by extending them the benefit of doubt they
are acquitted of all the charges levelled against
them. They shall be released from the jail
forthwith if not required to be detained in any
other case, whereas their Murder Reference
No.4-A/2022 sent by the learned trial court
for confirmation of their death sentence is
answered in negative.

These are the detailed reasons of our

acquitted the appellants of the charges
levelled against them and answered their
Murder References in negative.
