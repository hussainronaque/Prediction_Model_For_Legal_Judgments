SHAKEEL AHMAD, J.--- The State through A.G

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has filed, under section 417

Cr.PC, this appeal against the judgment dated

26.04.2014 of the learned Additional Sessions Judge-I,

Bannu , whereby accused respondents were acquitted.

Alongwith instant criminal appeal an application for

condonation of delay was also filed.

2. Learned A.A.G appearing on behalf of

the State argued that the delay in filing the appeal was

neither intentional nor deliberate, but due to non

availability of documents/ record, the most of the time

consumed in obtaining the documents from the

department concerned. He next submitted that under

the circumstances of compelling nature the delay can

D:\Azam P.S/OS

be condoned.

3. We have gone through the appeal and

considered the submission made by the learned A.A.G

representing the State.

4. Perusal of record reveals that impugned

judgment was passed on 26.04.2014, while this appeal

was filed on 14.05.2016 after expiry of one and half

year, which was returned with objection to re-file on

30.05.2016, but it was re-submitted on 08.08.2016,

with further delay of more than three months. The only

plea urged by the learned A.AG is that the delay was

occasioned due to non availability of documents/

record, and that most of the time consumed in

obtaining the documents from the department

concerned. For seeking the condonation delay of each

day has to be explained, which is lacking in this case.

Furthermore, the Government/State cannot be treated

differently than ordinary litigant and is not entitled to

preferential treatment and is to be treated on equal

footing with ordinary litigant. In this respect reference

-3-
can well be made in case titled “The State through

Advocate-General Sindh Vs. Amir Bux (1981 SCMR
410), wherein the Hon’ble supreme Court has held as

under:

"It must also be stated that it has been the
consistent view of this Court, as expressed
in Nazar v. The State 1968 SCMR 715,
Jalal Khan v. Lakhmir 1968 SCMR 1345,
Muhammad Khan vy. Sultan 1969 SCMR
82, Piran Ditta v. The State 1970 SCMR
282 and Nur Muhammad v. The State
1972 SCMR 331, that in petition against
acquittal delay cannot be condoned unless
it is shown that the petitioner was
precluded from filing his petition in time
due to some act of the acquitted
respondents, or by some circumstance of a
compelling nature, beyond the petitioner's
control. The reason for taking the strict
view is that in most jurisdictions an
acquittal, once recorded by a competent
Court is final, and the matter cannot be
reopened at the instance of any party
including the State. However, under our
law; an acquittal can be challenged in
certain circumstances, but if it is not
challenged within the period allowed by
law, it becomes final. In _ these
circumstances it is only just and proper
that a petition against acquittal must not
be entertained if it is filed beyond time,
unless it be shown that the petitioner was

prevented from moving the same by an act

-4-

of the acquitted accused; or by some
circumstance of a compelling nature

”

beyond the control of the petitioner.

5. In the reported case of “Government of

Punjab v. Muhammad Salam PLD 1995 SC 396” the

Honourable Supreme Court has held as under:--

"In the present case, the High Court gave
good reasons for declining to condone the
delay. It held that the ground taken by the
appellants in their application under
section 5 of the Limitation Act that they
could not file the appeal within time as
they had entered into correspondence with
litigating departments and the Solicitor
was quite vague and reliance was also
placed. on a judgment of this Court
reported in 1990 SCMR 1059 wherein it
was held that "it is a well-settled principle
of law that under section 5 of the
Limitation Act, delay of each day is to be
explained" and _ further that, the
Government cannot be treated differently
than a private litigant on the question of
limitation under section 5 of the

Limitation Act."

6. In order to bring the case for condonation

of delay, the appellant is required to show that there

was sufficient cause and it was beyond the control to

-5-

file appeal within the prescribed time. The ground

agitated for condonation of delay is neither reasonable

nor cogent nor confidence inspiring, therefore, the

delay cannot be condoned. Furthermore, nothing has

been alleged against the acquitted accused that the

delay was accrued due to some act of the acquitted

accused, who acquired valuable rights, which cannot

be lightly disturbed or destroyed, as held by the

Hon’ble Supreme Court in the reported case of

“Muhamamd Bashir Vs Province of Punjab” (2003

SCMR 83).

7. The ground shown for condonation of

delay is neither reasonable nor cogent nor inspire

confidence and the delay of about more than one and

half year cannot be condoned. This appeal as well as

criminal Msic: application are dismissed being barred

by time.
