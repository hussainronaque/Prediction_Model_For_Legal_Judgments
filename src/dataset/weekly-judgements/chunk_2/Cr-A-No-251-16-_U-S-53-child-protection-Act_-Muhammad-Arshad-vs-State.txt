bears my signature.”

7. After hearing the learned counsel for

the parties and appraisal of evidence, the learned
trial Court convicted and sentenced the appellant, as

mentioned in the earlier part of the judgment.

8. On 05.09.2016 when this appeal was

taken up for hearing, it was brought into the notice

of the Court that the appellant had died. On
24.10.2016 report of the Superintendent Jail,
Haripur was received which confirmed the death of
the appellant. In addition to the imprisonment, the
appellant was also burdened with the payment of
fine of Rs.2,00,000/- (two lacs). Counsel for the
parties were directed to assist the Court as to
whether after the death of the appellant, the appeal
would abate u/s 431 Cr.PC. Mr. Muhammad Ashfaq
Advocate volunteered to assist the Court as amicus

curie on the above mentioned proposition.

9. Learned counsel for the appellant filed

power of attorney on behalf of legal heirs of the

appellant.
10. Learned counsel for the appellant

submitted that Section 431 Cr.PC in unequivocal
terms provides that during pendency of the appeal,
when the appellant dies, his appeal would abate and
further submitted that the appeal will not abate in
those cases where there is sentence of fine only. His
submission is that the appellant was convicted for
imprisonment as well as sentence of fine, therefore,
his appeal shall abate as provided u/s 431 Cr.PC. On
merits, he submitted that the prosecution has been
miserably failed to prove charge against the

appellant. The testimony of the victim Mst. Malaika
(PW-7) is in direct conflict with the medical
evidence, the conduct of the complainant is not
above board. He further submitted that as the charge
was not proved and the appellant was acquitted of
the charges of rape and sexual assault while he was
only convicted u/s 53 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010. He also
assailed the conviction of the appellant as the same
was not in consonance with the provision of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection Act. He
prayed that the appeal of the appellant be abated u/s
431 Cr.PC and in alternate prayed for the acquittal
of the appellant from the charges leveled against
him on merits as well.

11. The learned AAG, assisted by the

learned counsel for the complainant submitted that
the appeal will be heard u/s 431 Cr.PC only if the
appellant has been adjudged guilty for
imprisonment and for fine and if the conviction is of
fine and imprisonment, then appeal would abate
about the imprisonment while to the extent of fine it
will remain alive and is to be heard on merits
because a separate mechanism has been provided
under the law for the recovery of fine, estate of the
appellant would be liable for the recovery of fine

under the Code of Criminal Procedure and
submitted that appeal is to be heard on merits to the
extent of fine. On merits, they have stated that the
appellant was charged for committing rape of minor
girl aged about 7/8 years. The medical evidence,
statement of Mst. Haleema (PW-8) support case of
the prosecution and the appellant was rightly found
guilty by the learned trial Court and prayed for the
dismissal of the appeal.

12. The learned amicus curie submitted

that appeal abates only when the appellant is
convicted for imprisonment if his conviction is of
fine also in either case whether that is only fine or
with fine, the appeal would not abate, the language
of Section 431 Cr.PC is clear, if the intention of the
legislature was that appeal would abate only in
cases where the sentence is of fine, then the word
only or either its other synonyms would have been
mentioned in Section 431 Cr.PC. He relied on the
judgments of the Apex Court in case titled Dr.
Ghulam Hussain (represented by 8 heirs) Vs The
State cited as 1971 SCMR 35, NLR 1998 Criminal
112 titled as Dilbar Sher Vs The State and he
prayed that the appeal will abate only to the extent
of imprisonment while regarding the fine the same

is to be heard.
13. Arguments of the learned counsel for

the parties were heard on the question of abatement

as well as on merits.
14. Before adverting to the maintainability

of the appeal and its abatement, this Court deems it
necessary to reproduce the relevant provision of law
i.e. Section 431 Cr.PC which is as under:

“431. Abatement of appeals.

Every appeal under [section

411-A, sub-section (2), or

section 417] shall finally abate

on the death of the accused,

and every other appeal under

this Chapter (except an

appeal from a sentence of

fine) shall finally abate on the

death of the appellant.”
As it is manifest from the plain reading of section
431 Cr.PC, appeal does not abate due to death of an
accused who has been sentenced to imprisonment as
well as fine. Sentence of imprisonment abates only
and not that of fine on his death pending hearing of
an appeal. Appellate Court may go into propriety
and legality of sentence of fine even after death of
accused/appellant. Usually a criminal appeal abates
on the death of the appellant but Section 431 Cr.PC
seems to have made an exception to this general
rule, however watchful glance of the section will

show that an appeal against a sentence of fine shall

not abate by reason of the death of the
accused/appellant, because it not a matter which
affects his person, but one which affects his estate,
where an accused has appealed against the sentence
of imprisonment and fine and before the appeal
comes up for hearing he dies, that part of the appeal
which relates to the sentence of imprisonment shall
abate on the death of the appellant but the other part
which relates to the sentence of fine shall not abate
on the death of the appellant.

In case of Dr. Ghulam Hussain and others Vs The
State, published in 1970 SCMR 35 it was held by
the Apex Court that if the appeal is pending before
the appellate Court in case of death of the appellant
during the pendency of the appeal, then the same
can be heard on merits and even the Court can pass any
order i.e. to maintain the conviction or acquit the
appellant. In this regard reliance is also placed on the
judgment reported in AJR 1962 MYSORE 275 (V
49 C 83) titled Govindrajalu and others Vs State of
Mysore, wisdom is derived from the judgment
which is reproduced as below:

“In the result, Criminal Appeals
Nos.393, 404 and 410 of 1958 are
dismissed subject to the
modification suggested above.
But it must be noted that the
appeal filed by A-3 (P. A. Shan-
mugha Sundaram Mudaliar) in so
far as it relates to the substantive
sentence imposed on_ him
abated because of his death
during the pendency of these
appeals. His appeal only survives
as regards the sentence of fine.”

Similarly reliance is placed on the judgment of
Apex Court of Allahabad cited as AIR 1957
Allahabad 20 (V 44 C 2 Jan.) titled as Sm. Vidya
Devi Vs State, wherein it was held that:

(2) The first question that falls for our
consideration is whether the appeal
filed by Jai Narain abated as a whole
on the death of the convict. To
answer this question it is necessary to
refer to $.431. Criminal P.C., which is
as follows:-

"Every appeal under S.411-A,

sub-s. (2) , or S. 417 shall finally abate
on the death of the accused, and
every other appeal under _ this
Chapter (except an appeal from a
sentence of fine) shall finally abate
on the death of the appellant.”
In a case where there is only a
sentence of imprisonment, no
difficulty arises because the sentence
of imprisonment lapse with the death
of the accused. In a case where the
accused has been sentenced to a
fine, the section makes it clear that
the appeal, as it relates to a sentence
of fine, does not abate.

In our opinion S.431 makes it
clear that the intention of the
Legislature is that where an appeal is
directed against a sentence of
imprisonment only, the appeal
abates as soon as the accused dies.
It is also manifested from the section
that where the sentence is one of fine,
the appeal does not abate and the
reason for this is obvious. Where a
sentence of fine is imposed, the State
can realise the fine from the assets
left by the deceased in the hands of
his legal representatives.

We see no reason why the
same principle should not be applied
to an appeal where an accused
person appeals both against the
sentence of imprisonment, and the
sentence of fine. As far as the
sentence of imprisonment is
concerned, the appeal shall abate,
but with regard to the sentence of
fine, the same appeal will not abate.
The argument that in appeal could
not be split up in two portions is not
sound. Where an appeal is filed both
against the sentence of imprisonment
and fine, it is always open to the
appellate Court to accept the appeal
in part.

For example, if a person is
sentenced to imprisonment and also
to a fine, it is open to the Court of
appeal to accept that portion of the
appeal which relates to the sentence
of fine and reject the other portion
which is against the sentence of
imprisonment. Where an accused has
appealed against the sentence of
imprisonment and fine, and before
the appeal comes for hearing he
dies, S. 431, Criminal P.C. will come
into play.

Under the provisions of S. 431
that part of the appeal which relates
to the sentence of imprisonment shall
abate on the death of the appellant
but the other part which relates to the
sentence of fine shall not abate on
the death of the appellant. In the
case of Lalla Singh v. State 1958 All LJ
451 (A), the appellant Lallah Singh
had been sentenced to imprisonment
as well as to a fine of Rs.200/-, Lallah
Singh filed an appeal but he died
during the pendency of appeal.

Oak J. held that the appeal
had abated in part so far as it related
to the sentence of imprisonment but
as regards the sentence of fine it did
not abate. We are in agreement with
the observations made in that case.
We are of the opinion that the appeal
of Jai Narain abated in respect of the
sentence of imprisonment; and that it
did not abate with regard to the
sentence of fine. We, therefore,
overrule the contention that the entire
appeal abated on the death of jai
Narain.

Reliance is also placed on the judgment of Hon’ble

High Court NER 1998 Criminal 112 titled as

Dhaular Sher etc Vs The _ State,

enunciated from the judgment is reproduced as

below:

“Before making comments on the

evidence an important
development has taken place.
Dhaular Sher who is the main
accused and whose shot hit the
deceased has admittedly died
during the pendency of his
appeal. According to the learned
counsel for the appellant he was
murdered at the instance of the
complainant party. How and in
what manner and by whom he
was murdered is not relevant for
disposal of this appeal. However,
on account of admitted fact that
he is dead his case covered by
Section 431, Cr.PC. His appeal,
therefore, stands abated. The
sentence of imprisonment,
therefore, becomes
inconsequential. However _ his
sentence of fine does not stand
abated. The counsel for the
appellant has informed that one
of the legal heirs has contacted
him nor he is n a position to
submit if any of the legal heirs
intend to pursue the appeal in
respect of imposition of fine on
him. His sentence of _ fine,
therefore, remains unabated
unless his appeal is accepted and

he earns a clean acquittal.

15. By now it is settled that on the death of

the appellant whether he is convicted and sentenced
for payment of fine with imprisonment or without
imprisonment, his appeal will not abate to the extent
of fine as provided by Section 431 Cr.PC in view of

the above the appeal of the appellant is to be heard
on merits and the case with regard to the sentence of
fine is to be appraised in accordance with the settled
principle of the criminal justice.

So in view of this Court, the appeal to the extent of

fine is maintainable and has not been abated.
16. Now adverting to the merits of the

case, the prosecution relied on the statement of
victim child Mst. Malaika appeared as (PW-7). It is
pertinent to mention here that at the time of her
examination before the Court, her age was recorded
as 07/08 years by the learned trial Court. Her cross-
examination only is in the form of suggestion which
has been denied by this witness. She was never
cross-examined by the defence on the material
aspect of the case. No doubt, the Court can take into
consideration the suggestions but suggestions are to
be considered in light of the other material elicited
from the particular witness. In this case, the
testimony of the victim Mst. Malaika (PW-7)
remains un-shattered and unchallenged, so the same
cannot be brushed aside. In addition to the statement
of PW-7, mother of the victim Mst. Haleema also
supports the case of the prosecution. She was the
person who took her to the Police Station on the
very first day and she lodged the report vide Daily

Diary No.32 dated 20.02.2015, though she is not an
eyewitness but her statement can be considered as
admissible within the meaning of Article 19 of the
Qanoon-e-Shahadat as Res Gestae because the
mother was the person who took her to the Police
Station, prior to that she reached to the place of
occurrence and there the victim Mst. Malaika was
found weeping. The defence has tried to shatter the
credibility by referring to her previous disputes of
which one was with her in laws prior to the
occurrence which she described as domestic matter
between them, while the second incident is with
regard to the quarrel with the son of the appellant
but that was after the present occurrence when they
trespassed her house and threatened her that their
father is in Jail, because of complainant and they

will not spare her.

17. In view of this Court, the above

referred incidents would not damage the credibility
of the complainant Mst. Haleema (PW-8). Both
these witnesses had with stood the test of cross-
examination and their credibility remains un-
rebutted. The victim was examined by PW-4 Dr.
Irum Habib DHQ Hospital, Nowshera and she
observed that there was periurethereal tear with
bleeding at 10 O’clock position on her right side

showing that her vagina was disturbed though the
hymen and urethra were intact. No other bruises or
abrasions are seen in the body. Perurethereal and
rectal swabs are taken which were sent to the
histopathology Ex.Pz and according to his opinion
the suspected seminal stains on the articles in
question were subjected to chemical serological and
microscopic analysis which reveals that semen of
human origin was detected on the swab. The
medical evidence and the serological analysis
support the statement of the victim (PW-7) Mst.

Malika and complainant.
18. Though the learned trial Court has

convicted the appellant under section 53 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare
Act, 2010 falls under the definition of sexual abuse
Section 2(1) (y) is reproduced as under:

“Sexual abuse means employing,
using, forcing, persuading, inducing,
enticing or coercing any child to
engage in, or assisting any other
person to engage _ in_ fondling,
stroking, caressing, exhibitionism,
voyeurism or any obscene or
sexually explicit conduct or
stimulation of such conduct either
independently or in conjunction with
other acts, with or without consent.”

The definition of the child abuse is squarely
attracted to the facts and circumstances of the case
due to the reason that Mst. Malaika victim deposed

in her Court statement that accused inserted his
finger in her private part and the appellant has been
rightly convicted by the learned trial Court for the
above mentioned offence. The appeal to the extent
of sentence of imprisonment has already been
abated while his conviction and sentence of fine is
maintained.

Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed in

above terms.
