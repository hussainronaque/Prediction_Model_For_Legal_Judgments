JUDGMENT

MUHAMMAD IJAZ KHAN, J.- Through the
instant revision petition, petitioner has challenged
the order and judgment of the learned Additional
District Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi Khwazakhela, Swat
dated 29.06.2021, whereby his appeal was
dismissed, which he had filed against the order and
Judgment of the learned executing Court dated
19.12.2020, who vide the same had dismissed the

execution petition filed by the present petitioner.

2. Precisely the facts of the case are that
respondent No. 1 namely Wasim Khan brought a
suit for a declaration to the effect that he is owner-
in-possession of the suit property to the extent of
his 1/5" share on the basis of a will deed dated
12.06.2015 fully mentioned in the heading of the
plaint. It has also been pleaded that defendants have

no right to deny this right of the respondent No. 1/

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Haz. Khan
-2-
plaintiff. He has also challenged the inheritance

mutation No. 1452 attested on 24.02.2016 and the
subsequent entries in the revenue record in which
the respondent No. 1/ plaintiff was not shown as
owner to the extent of 1/5" share and as such, such
entries were pleaded as illegal, unlawful and
ineffective upon the rights of the respondent No.

1/plaintiff.

3. The aforesaid suit was contested by
the present petitioner, then defendant, and
ultimately the same was decreed by the learned trial
Court in favour of the respondent No. 1/plaintiff to
the extent of 1/5" share against the defendant, now
petitioner, vide judgment and decree dated
05.06.2018. This judgment and decree was
challenged before the learned appellate Court
through an appeal, however, the appeal was also
dismissed vide judgment and decree dated
08.05.2019 and later on it was put to execution and
was implemented by making necessary entries in
the revenue record, whereby mutation No. 1692

was entered and attested on 12.07.2019.

4. Later on, the present petitioner also

filed an execution petition for execution of the

decree dated 05.06.2018 on the ground that he

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-3-
being the legal heir of Sohrab Khan is also entitled

to derive benefit from the said decree as was
extended to respondent No. 1/ plaintiff, however,
his execution petition was dismissed by the learned
executing Court vide one of the impugned order
and judgment dated 19.12.2020 and thereafter,
appeal was filed by the present petitioner before the
learned appellate Court, however, the same was
also dismissed vide the impugned order and
Judgment dated 29.06.2021. Petitioner has now
challenged the aforesaid two orders and judgments
of the two Courts below before this Court through

the instant revision petition.

5. Arguments of learned counsel for the
parties were heard in detail and the record perused

with their able assistance.

6. The main stance of learned counsel for
the petitioner was that since the judgment as well as
the decree is based on a will deed dated 12.06.2015,
where other legal heirs of Sohrab Khan including
the present petitioner has also been allocated his
share, therefore the learned executing Court has
wrongly dismissed his execution petition. He also

made reference to some subsequent developments,

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-4.
which took place as a result of execution of the

aforesaid decree.

7. As against this learned counsel
representing the respondents states that since no
decree was passed in favour of the present
petitioner, then defendant, therefore the learned
executing Court has rightly dismissed his execution
petition and has lawfully been affirmed by the

learned appellate Court.

8. The record would reveal that the suit
was filed by Wasim Khan (respondent No. 1/
plaintiff) for a declaration to the effect that he is
owner-in-possession of 1/5" share on the basis of a
will deed dated 12.06.2015, which was made by his
grandfather, which suit was contested by the
present petitioner, then defendant, and ultimately a
decree to the extent of 1/5" share was passed by the
learned trial Court in favour of the respondent
No. 1/plaintiff and against the petitioner, then
defendant, and as such later on, the learned
executing Court on the application of respondent
No. 1/plaintiff has executed the decree as was
passed in his favour, whereas the execution petition
of petitioner was rightly dismissed as though

learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-5-
argued that in the original judgment, the right of

petitioner, then defendant, has also been
acknowledged, declared and ascertained, however,
a minute perusal of the judgment would show that
1/5" share of the respondent No. 1/plaintiff has
been decreed, whereas no finding has been
recorded with respect to the remaining 4/5" share
of which the petitioner seeks its execution,
therefore neither the judgment nor the decree do
provides for any of the executable rights of the
petitioner. It may be reiterated that the present
petitioner may approach to the civil Court for
seeking an identical decree, if so advised, however,
since the executing Court is bound to execute the
decree only and it can neither amend nor alter nor
add to the decree, therefore the two Courts below
have rightly declined the desired relief to the
present petitioner. It is settled law that the
executing Court cannot go beyond the decree and it
has to execute the decree in terms in which it has
been passed. In the case of Irshad Masih and
others vs. Emmanuel Masih and others reported
as 2014 SCMR_ 148], the Hon’ble Apex Court has
held that thus, whatever was the entitlement of Mst.
Margret, the predecessor-in-interest of the

petitioners, it is for all intents and purposes now a

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Muhammad [jaz Khan
-6-
past and closed transaction. It is for this reason that

in the order under review dated 22.10.2009 this
Court has endorsed the view of the High Court
contained in the judgment dated 11.11.2002 by
merely making reference to the observations that
"the moment Mst. Margret died, the property would
revert back to the legal heirs of Arora under section
30-A of the Colonization of Government Lands
(Punjab) Act 1912. Respondents being sons of Mst.
Margret were thus left with no locus standi to file
execution petition on 19.6.1998, after the death of
Mst. Margret". This being the undisputed factual
position in the present case, as rightly held by the
High Court in its judgment dated 11.11.2002, the
order of remand passed by the learned Additional

District Judge Sahiwal dated 25.1.2001 was not

sustainable in law, as the executing Court cannot go
beyond the mandate of the said judgment_and thus
the present petitioners had no locus standi to seek
execution of either the judgments dated 20.1.1969,
whereby their predecessor's suit_was disposed_of

without grant of relief prayed for, or the other

judgment of the Supreme Court dated 18.6.1995,
dismissing their petition and confirming the
judgment of the Lahore High Court dated

8.12.1993. Rather, after the death of Mst. Margret

Abdul Sabooh/* (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan
-7-
in the year 1996, there was nothing in the said

judgments which was executable at the request of
the present petitioners. Similarly, in the case of
Taugeer Ahmad Qureshi vs. Additional District
Judge, Lahore and 2 others reported as PLD 2009
Supreme Court 760, the Hon’ble Apex Court has
held that there is no cavil to the proposition that
the executing Court cannot go beyond the decree
but at the same time the executing Court can look
into the questions whether the decree or part
thereof is executable or in-executable and if for
any reason the decree has become in-executable,
the executing Court is empowered to declare so
and if a part of the decree is in-executable and
that part is severable from other part(s) of the
decree then the executing Court is empowered to
refuse the execution of the in-executable part of
the decree and may proceed with the execution of
the rest of the decree. In the case of Mst. Naseem
Akhtar and 4 others vs. Shalimar General
Insurance, Company Limited and 2 others
reported as 1994 SCMR 22, it was also held by the
Hon’ble Apex Court that it is a well-known rule

that the Court executing the decree cannot _go

beyond it and allow its validity to be impugned.

Abdul Sabooh/* , (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan

Further reliance in this respect may also be placed
on the following judgments:-
i. Province of Punjab through Secretary
Industries, Government of the Punjab,
Civil Secretariat, Lahore vs. Burewala
Textile Mills Limited (2001 SCMR 396);
and
iii Muhammad Ali and others versus
Ghulam Sarwar and others (1989
SCMR 640)
9. For what has been discussed above,
the order and judgment of the learned appellate
Court dated 29.06.2021 and that of the learned
executing Court dated 19.12.2020 are perfectly in
accordance with the spirit of law and they have not
committed any illegality or irregularity to warrant
interference of this Court in exercise of its

revisional jurisdiction, which are maintained and

upheld and consequently, the instant revision

iy petition being bereft of any merit is hereby
dismissed.
