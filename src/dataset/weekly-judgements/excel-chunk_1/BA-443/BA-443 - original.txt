Advocate.

Respondents:- (the State & I another) by

Malak Sarwar Khan, State counsel and
Barrister Dr. Adnan Khan, Advocate.

MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.-_ This petition

pertains to Cr. M B.A. 443-M of 2017 preferred
by accused/Petitioner Nasir Iqbal being
implicated in case FIR No. 452 dated
04.05.2017 charged under sections 489-F, 420
PPC registered at Police Station Matta District
Swat and is looking for the grant of bail after

arrest.

2; The Petitioner earlier tried his luck
for the similar relief before the Court of learned
Judicial Magistrate/Illaqa Qazi Matta Swat
| am
a through bail application No. 142/4 of the year

2017, which was dismissed by an order dated

15.07.2017. Next off, the matter was taken up

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
before the Court of learned Izafi Zila
Qazi/Additional Sessions Judge Matta Swat via
B.A. No. 228/4 of the year 2017, where too the
wheel of fortune did not favour the Petitioner

and the application stood dismissed.

3. At first instance, the  applicant-
complainant presented an application to the learned
Sub-Divisional Police Officer Matta Circle Swat
that the accused/Petitioner had issued him cheque
No. 08242748 for an amount of Rs. 20 lac of the
United Bank Limited Tehsil Matta Branch on
account of sale of his personal vehicle by the type
of TZ NCP Model 2004. The said cheque when
presented for encashment in the Bank concerned
was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the
account of the accused/Petitioner. In view whereof
an inquiry was initiated which culminated into FIR

ibid registered against the accused/Petitioner.

4. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel for the Petitioner, learned counsel for
the complainant and learned Astt: Advocate
General for the State, record with their

assistance gone through.

5. It appears from the record that though
the accused/Petitioner has been directly charged
for issuance of bogus cheque with dishonest
intention by the complainant and was mainly
refused bail on the pretext being previously
involved in alike offences, but bare perusal of
the record would reveal that the cheque in
question has been issued to the complainant in
respect of sale of his personal vehicle, thus, the
matter in between the parties appears to be civil
in nature. Moreover the offence under which the
accused/Petitioner stood nominated as an
accused entails maximum punishment up to 3
years, thereby does not fall within the restrictive
limbs of section 497 (1) Cr.P.C and in such like
cases grant of bail is rule and refusal thereof is
an exception. This principle of law has been
enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of
Pakistan in case law cited as 2011 SCMR 1708
" Riaz Jafar Natig vs Muhammad Nadeem
Dar and others", wherein the relevant citation

speaks off:-

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
a

" Thus keeping in view the law
laid down in the case of Zafar
Iqbal V. Muhammad Anwar and
others (2009 SCMR_ 1488)
ordaining that granting bail must
be favourably considered and
should only be declined in

exceptional cases.
6. Above all, the latest view of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Criminal
Appeal No. 273 of 2017 has altogether formed a
distinct view that for the offence when an
accused has been charged does not attract the
prohibitory clause, there can be no strong reason
to withhold the concession of bail, as grant of
bail in such like cases is a rule and refusal is an

exception.

‘Ts In view of the above. observations

which are, of course purely tentative in nature,

ye the Petitioner is entitled to the concession of
-_

bail. Hence he is asked to furnish bail bonds in
the sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lacs)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who shall

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and

men of means.

8. These are the reasons of my short
