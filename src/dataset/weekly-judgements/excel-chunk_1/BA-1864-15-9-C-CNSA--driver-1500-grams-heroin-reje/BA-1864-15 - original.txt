JUDGMENT SHEET
IN THE PESHAWAR HIGH COURT, PESHAWAR
(Judicial Department)

Cr.MBA 1864-P of 2015.

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 25.11.2015

Petitioner by: Mr. Jawad Khan Advocate.

Respondent /State by: Syed Sikandar Hayat
Shah, AAG.

MUHAMMAD DAUD KHAN, J.- Shah Pur, the
petitioner seeks his post arrest bail in case FIR
No.491dated 12.8.2015 registered under Section 9-C
CNSA, at P.S. Nasir Bagh, Peshawar.

2. As per prosecution case, during Nakabandi
conducted on spy information regarding smuggling
of narcotics, the local police intercepted Alto
Motorcar bearing No.LRR-0859, being driven by
the petitioner, accompanied by co-accused Amir
occupying front seat while Farooq Javed & Kashif
Ali were occupying the rear seat of the said Car. On
search, one packet heroin weighing one Kg was
recovered from the secret cavity of the driver gate.
On personal search from all the four accused,

500/500 grams heroin (Total 2 Kg) were recovered.
-2-

Consequently, the accused were arrested, contraband
alongwith vehicle were taken into possession and a
case vide FIR mentioned above was registered
against the accused.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. As per FIR, from all the three co-accused
500/500 grams heroin were recovered whereas 500
grams was recovered from the possession of
petitioner and one Kg was recovered from the secret
cavity of driver gate of the Car. Learned counsel for
petitioner mainly stressed on the plea of principle of
consistency that all the three co-accused from whose
possession 500/500 grams heroin were recovered,
are availing the concession of bail. However, the
role of petitioner being driver of the vehicle is
different than the role of co-accused who were
occupying other seats as the petitioner being driver
of the vehicle, was Incharge of the same and all the
articles lying therein would be under his control and
possession, so recovery of 1000 grams heroin from
secret cavity of the said vehicle would have been in
the conscious knowledge of petitioner and recovery

of total 1500 grams of heroin made jointly from his
-3-

possession and secret cavity of his car having
conscious knowledge about the same being driver of
the vehicle. Besides, it is well settled principle that a
person who is on driving seat of the vehicle, shall be
held responsible for transportation of the narcotics
having knowledge of the same as no condition or
qualification has been made in Section 9-C of
CNSA that the possession should be an exclusive
one and can be joint one with two or more persons.
The wisdom is derived from the case titled, “Kashif
Amir _Vs__The _State”(PLD 2010 SC __1052).
Therefore, the petitioner cannot get benefit of the
plea of principle of consistency. The recovery of
narcotics is fully supported by the marginal
witnesses of recovery memo being prepared on the
spot in their presence as well as positive FSL report
according to which the samples of recovered
contraband were heroin. No malafide or ill-will has
been pointed by the petitioner on the part of local
police regarding his false involvement in the present
case which could be made a ground for his release

on bail.
-4-

5. Apart from above, it is also held by the
august Supreme Court in the case titled, “Socha Gul
Vs The State” (2015 SCMR_ 1077), that offences
punishable under CNS Act of 1997 are by its nature
heinous and considered to be the offences against
the society at large and it is for this reason that the
statute itself has provided a note of caution under
Section 51 of CNSA before enlarging an accused on
bail in the ordinary course. When we refer to the
standard set out under section 497 Cr.PC, for grant
of bail to an accused involved in an offence under
Section 9 CNSA, even on that basis we find that an
accused charged with an offence, prescribing
various punishments, as reproduced above, is not
entitled for grant of bail merely on account of the
nature or quantity of narcotics and that appreciation
of evidence is not permissible at bail stage and
secondly in such situation, looking to the peculiar
features and nature of the offence, the trial Court
may depart from the normal standards prescribed in
the case of “Ghulam Murtaza Vs The State” (PLD
2009) and award him any other legal punishment,

thus in our opinion, ratio of judgment in the case of
-5-

Ghulam _ Murtaza (cupra) is not relevant at bail

stage.

6. The prosecution has collected sufficient
material connecting the petitioner with the
commission of a non-bailable offence, therefore, he
is not entitled to the concession of bail at this stage.
7. In view of what has been observed above,
this petition being devoid of merit is dismissed.
However, the above findings are tentative in nature
for the disposal of instant bail petition only and shall
not influence the mind of the trial Court who is
expected to decide the matter purely on merit and in
accordance with law.

Announced.
25.11.2015.
