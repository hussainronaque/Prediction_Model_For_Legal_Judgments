2. Earlier, these Petitioners filed their
separate bail applications for the similar relief
(post arrest bail) before the Court of leaned
Additional Sessions Judge-VI/Izafi Zila Qazi
Swat, which were dismissed on 09.02.2018 and

20.02.2018 respectively.

3. Both these bail applications pertain
to the same case registered against them by the
local police of Police Station Mingora Swat
vide FIR ibid, therefore are disposed of through

this singled-out judgment.

4. During the course of recovery of
huge quantity of Chars weighing 5,255 grams
from the possession of accused/Petitioner Ali
Mahir, who had secretly placed the same in the
motorcar bearing No. Ai-5173 and was roaming
to find customers for the purpose of selling. He
was chased and apprehended at a place known
as Haji Baba near old Kokarai ‘Adda’ while he
was sitting on the driver seat. During search of
the motorcar beneath the driver seat out of

secret cavities the police recovered 5 packets of

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan
3
Chars which were wrapped up with yellow

colour plastic (%). The accused at that time was

having Rs. 25,000/- as sale proceed. Out of each
packet 5/5 grams were separated for chemical
analysis while rest of the Chars were sealed into
separate parcels. The accused Mahir Ali during
the course of investigation disclosed that his
brother Akhtar Munir is also co-owner of the
Chars and the motorcar belong to him, thereby,
the said Akhtar Munir was also arrayed as an

accused in this case.

5. Having heard arguments of learned
counsel appearing on behalf of both of the
Petitioners and learned Astt: Advocate General
for the State, record with their valuable

assistance gone through.

6. Learned counsel for the Petitioners

rendered in Cr. M B.A. No. 44-P of 2017 titled

as “ Niamat Khan V/S The State decided on

03.02.2017 by His Lordship Mr. Justice Rooh-
ul-Amin Khan at Hon’ble Principal seat of
Peshawar High Court Peshawar, unreported
judgment of this Court_in_Cr.M B.A. No.
2342-P/2017 decided on 13.11.2017 by His
Lordship Mr. Justice Muhammad Ghazanfar
Khan and unreported judgment of this Court
delivered in Cr.M_ B.A. No. 42-P of 2017 on

30.01.2017 by His Lordship Mr. Justice
Tkramullah Khan. In the light of these dictums

of the Hon’ble superior Courts prayed for the
grant of bail in favour of each of the Petitioner.
Inversely, learned Astt: Advocate General
appearing on behalf of the State vehemently
opposed the grant of bail in favour of the
Petitioners in view of their previous

involvement in offences of similar nature and

Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Tbrahim Khan

being squarely fall within the category of

habitual offenders.

7. Both these Petitioners have been
assigned different roles. Amongst them,
Ali Mahir was apprehended while sitting on the
driver seat and beneath in the secret cavities 5
packets of Chars were wrapped in plastic
yellow color (4), which on weighment came to
5,255 grams. This is not for the first time that he
is involved in this business of sale of narcotics.
There are several other cases registered against
him. These include case FIR No. 433 under
section 9 (c) CNSA pertaining to recovery of
1025 grams registered at PS Matta Swat, case
FIR No. 654 dated 18.7.2017 under section 9 (c)
CNSA registered at PS Mingora Swat of
recovery of 2081 grams and case FIR No. 101
dated 20.3.2012 under section % PHO
registered at Police Station Abanr, wherein he
has been convicted for fine of Rs. 500/-.
Therefore, the Petitioner Mahir Ali is a habitual
offender in the business of selling Chars. The

report of the Forensic Science Laboratory would

ee __
Nawab (S.B.) Hon’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

further confirm of the recovery of Chars with its
physical appearance of brown solid. Hence on
account of his previous history and having
misused the concession of bail in other cases,
this time, he being apprehended with huge
quantity of narcotics. He is not at all entitled to
the concession of bail, so, the bail application

on his behalf stands dismissed.

8. Whereas the role of Petitioner
Akhtar Munir is on different lines, he has been
nominated by his brother Ali Mahir in the
statement before the police but he was not
apprehended on the spot. May be he has been
named as the motorcar from which the recovery
has been effected is his ownership. Although
there are other cases registered against him yet
there is no record of his conviction in all those
cases. His case falls within the scope of further
inquiry. Thereby he is entitled to the concession
of bail. Hence he is asked to furnish bail bonds
in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees two lacs)
with two sureties each in the like amount to the

satisfaction of learned Trial Court, who shall

ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and

men of means.

9. These are the reasons of my short
order of even date. wo
