ABDUL SHAKOOR, J.--- Accused/ petitioner namely

Fawad Khan involved in case F.I.R No. 603 dated

23.08.2017 under sections 324/34 P.P.C, Police Station

Saddar, district Bannu, after being refused concession of

bail by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Bannu

has come to this court for the same relief.
2. Succinct facts as set out in the first

information report, referred above are that complainant

jamshaid Khan in injured condition on 23.08.2017 at

18.10 hours in emergency room of Civil Hospital,

Bannu reported the matter to the effect that on the

eventful day he after offering his Asar prayers, when

came out from the mosque, he saw accused/ petitioner

Fawad Khan alongwith other accused namely Wafid

Khan, duly armed with Kalashnikovs. Both the accused

on seeing started firing at him with the intention to

commit his qatl-e-amd, as a result of which he was hit

and fell down. The accused after commission of offence

decamped from the spot. Motive for the offence alleged

by the complainant was verbal altercation between the

accused and his cousins some time prior to the

occurrence.

3. I have heard arguments of learned counsel

for the petitioner and learned A.A.G representing the

state assisted by learned counsel for respondent/
complainant and perused the record with their valuable

assistance.

4. Perusal of the material available on record

reveals that it is day light occurrence, both the parties

are resident of the same village and very much known to

each other, hence, there is no question of

misidentification. Further, the complainant has charged

the accused/ petitioner and co-accused by name in the

promptly lodged report.

5. The accused/petitioner has been assigned

effective role of firing, which resulted into causing

injuries on abdomen of the complainant, which is vital

part of the body. As per medico legal report the

complainant Jamshaid Khan received one entry wound

in abdomen above umbilical region without any exit and

other one firearm entry wound on the right leg above

knee joint, but with no exit. Four small entry wounds on

left thigh. One small entry wound on left forearm. Such
multiple entry wounds support the version of

complainant.

6. More so, two crime empties also recovered

from the spot by the investigating officer. When all

these pieces of evidence taken into juxtaposition a prima

facie case is made out, connecting the accused/

petitioner for commission of offence, which falls within

the prohibitory clause of section 497 (1) Cr.PC.

7. So far as arguments of learned counsel for

the accused/petitioner that he is juvenile and under

section 10 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance,

deserves to be released on bail. Section 10 of the

Juvenile Justice System ordinance, provides that:

“10. Arrest and bail.-(1) Where a
child is arrested for commission of an
offence, the officer incharge of the police
station in which the child is detained shall,
as soon as may be, inform-

(a) The guardian of the child, if he
can be found, of such arrest
and inform him of the time,
date and name of the juvenile
Court before which the child
shall be produced; and
(b) The concerned Probation
Officer to enable him to obtain
such information about the
child and other material
circumstances which may be
of assistance to the juvenile
Court for making inquiry.

(2) Where a child accused of a
non-bailable offence is arrested, he shall,
without any delay and in no case later than
twenty-four hours from such arrest, be
produced before the juvenile Court.

(3) Without prejudice to the
provisions of the Code, a child accused of a
bailable offence shall, if already not
released under section 496 of Code, be
released by the juvenile Court on bail, with
or without surety, unless it appears that
there are reasonable grounds for believing
that the release of the child shall bring him
into association with any criminal or expose
the child to any danger, in which case, the
child shall be placed under the custody of a
Probation Officer or a suitable person or
institution dealing with the welfare of the
children if parent or guardian of the child is
not present, but shall not under any
circumstances be kept in a police station or
jail in such cases.

(4) The juvenile Court shall, in a
case where a child is not granted bail under
subsection (3), direct for tracing the
guardian of such child and where the
guardian of the’ child is traced out, the
juvenile Court may immediately release the
child on bail.

(5) Where a child under the age of
fifteen years is arrested or detained for an
offence, which is _ punishable with
imprisonment of less than ten years, shall
be treated as if he was accused of
commission of a bailable offence.
(6) No child under the age of
fifteen years shall be arrested under any of
the laws dealing with preventive detention
or under the provisions of Chapter VIII of
the Code.

(7) Notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code and except where a
juvenile Court is of the opinion that the
delay in the trial of the accused has been
occasioned by an act or omission of the
accused or any other person acting on his
behalf or in exercise of any right or
privilege under any law for the time being
in force, a child who, for commission of an
offence, has been detained, shall be
released on bail,-

(a) If, being accused of an offence
punishable with death has been
detained for such an offence
for a continuous period
exceeding one year and whose
trial for such an offence has
not concluded;

(b) If, being accused of any"
offence punishable for
imprisonment for life has been
detained for such an offence
for a continuous period
exceeding six months and
whose trial for such offence
has not concluded; or

(c) Who, being accused of any
offence not punishable with
death, or imprisonment for
life, has been detained for such
an offence for a continuous
period exceeding four months
and whose trial for such an
offence has not concluded:
Provided that where a child of
the age of fifteen years or
above is arrested, the Court
may refuse to grant bail if
there are reasonable grounds to
believe that such child is
involved in an offence which
in its opinion is serious,
heinous, gruesome, _ brutal,
sensational in character or
shocking to public morality or
he is a previous convict of an
offence punishable with death
or imprisonment for life.”

8. Petitioner Fawad Khan, via card of arrest

has been shown to be the age of 15/16 years. In this

respect Secondary School Certificate of the accused/

petitioner produced, according to which his date of birth

is 15.03.2000, whereas the alleged occurrence took

place on 23.08.2017, if his age is counted from the date

of birth till date of occurrence, it came out 17 years 5

months and 8 days. Section 10 of the Juvenile Justice

System Ordinance, has provided some concession for

the accused, who are under the age of 15 years, but there

is a proviso under section 10 (7) of the Juvenile Justice

System Ordinance, according to which, if they are

involved in a case of heinous nature, then they may not

be released on bail. While the age of accused/ petitioner
is above 15 years, according to SSC certificate. The

person who is charged for a crime of heinous nature

cannot claim any premium, on the basis of his minor

age, because mere minority per-se, is no ground for

grant of bail. Section 10 of the ibid Ordinance, does not

give the concession of bail to a juvenile accused in an

offence falling within the Prohibitory Clause of section

497 Cr.P.C., nor the tender age, can be used as a license

by a juvenile to kill or attempt to kill, the innocent

people. In genuine cases, it may be invoked in favour of

the accused to get him released on bail, but it is noticed

that this concession is being misused in the society by

the youngsters. So, to curb the menace of rampant

crimes, by the youngsters, it is in the interest of society,

not to allow them bail on such technical grounds to

discourage them in commission of crimes for their better

future. No doubt some concession could be extended to

the juveniles during trial, but not at bail stage. In this

respect reliance can be placed on case titled
“Farmanullah_and_ another Vs the Sate and another

(2005 P.Cr.L.J 1500).

9. Accused/ petitioner is not said to be not

aware as single injury from the firearm weapon

particularly of Kalashnikov would cause death of

injured. The firing by some person with Kalashnikov

sufficiently reflects his intention to kill the other.

10. For what has been discussed above, the

accused/ petitioner is not entitled for the concession of

bail, hence, this bail petition stands dismissed. However,

the accused being juvenile, the prosecution is directed to

submit challan within a fortnight, while the learned trial

court shall conclude the trial within specific period as

provided under the National Judicial Policy.

Announced.
