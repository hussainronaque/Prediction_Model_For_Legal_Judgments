JUDGMENT

38 28 2 OK

AHMAD ALL, J.- Through the instant bail petition,
the accused-petitioner (Muhammad Umair), seeks his
post-arrest bail in case FIR No.202 dated 24.06.2019,
charged under Section 377-B PPC/50/53-CPA r/w 512
Cr.P.C, Police Station, Mandani (Charsadda). Same
relief was, however, declined to the petitioner by the
learned trial Court vide order dated 06.11.2019.

2. Brief facts of the case are that complainant
charged the present accused petitioner for trying to
subject his son to unnatural sexual intercourse.
Accordingly, FIR ibid was registered and the accused-
petitioner was taken into custody, hence the instant
petition for bail.

3. Arguments heard and record perused.

4. Perusal of record reveals that the occurrence

took place on 24.06.2019 and report was lodged on
Page 20f6
27.06.2019 after delay of about 3 days without any
plausible explanation.

5. No doubt, the complainant, in his report, has
though charged accused for the commission of offence,
but the medical report available on record suggests that
no sexual act was committed with the victim. Except
the solitary statement of complainant, no other
incriminating evidence is available on record to prima
facie connect the accused-petitioner with the
commission of crime. Besides, no other eyewitness has
been cited so as to support the version of complainant.
Reliance is placed on 2019 P.Cr.L.J 899.

6. So far as applicability of sections 50/53 of the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare
Act, 2010 (hereinafter to be referred as the Act of
2010), is concerned, it depicts that this law was
specially introduced/enacted and promulgated in the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with particular purposes i.e. to
provide for the care, protection, maintenance, welfare,
training, education, rehabilitation and reintegration of
‘children at risk' in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the
sake of convenience and ready reference, the preamble

of the Act of 2010, is reproduced below:-

"WHEREAS, it is expedient to provide for the care,
protection, maintenance, welfare, training, education,
rehabilitation and reintegration of children at risk in the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa".

"Child at risk" has been defined under section 2(1)(e) of
the Act in the following words:-
Page 3 of 6

"Child at risk" means a child in need of protection, who
(i) is at risk, including an orphan, child with
disabilities, child of migrant workers, child
working and or living on the street, child in

conflict with the law and child living in extreme
poverty.

(ii) is found begging; or

(iii) is found without having any home or settled
place of abode or without any ostensible meaning
of subsistence; or

(iv) has a parent or guardian who is unfit or
incapacitated to exercise control over the child;
or

(v) lives in a brothel or with a prostitute or
frequently visits any place being used for the
purpose of prostitution or is found to associate
with any prostitute or any other person who leads

an immoral or depraved life; or

(vi) is being or is likely to be abused or exploited for
immoral or illegal purposes or gain; or

(vii) is beyond the parental control; or
(viii) is imprisoned with the mother or born in jail;

(ix) has lost his parents or one of the parents and has
no adequate source of income; or

(x) is victim of an offence punishable under this Act
or any other law for the time being in force and
his parent or guardian is convicted or accused for
the commission of such offence; Or

(xi) _ is left abandoned by his parent or parents as the
case may be, which will include a child born out
of wedlock and left abandoned by his parent;

7. Keeping the Preamble of the Act in
juxtaposition with the definition of the "Child at risk"
as contemplated under section 2(1)(e) of the Act
coupled with the facts and circumstances of the instant
case it could not be ascertained as to whether the
alleged victim, falls under the definition of "child at
risk" or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the

applicability of sections 50/53 of the Act of 2010, to
the case of petitioner is yet a begging question.
Wisdom can be derived from case law reported in
2016 SCMR 1523, 2014 MLD 190 & 2018 YLR

Note 114.

8. In such eventuality, when the child did not fall
under the definition of “child at risk” as provided
under Section 53, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child
Protection and Welfare Act, 2010; and when except
the solitary statement of complainant without any
medical support, no other incriminating evidence is
available on record to show any nexus of the accused-
petitioner with the commission of crime, this Court
could not withhold the concession of bail, at least, at

this stage.

9. Moreover, in the instant case, no compliance
with the provision of Section 164-B Cr.P.C has been
made because no samples for DNA test have been
obtained either from the accused-petitioner or victim
despite the fact that the word “shall” is used in the said
provision, making its applicability mandatory. The
prosecution must keep in mind this aspect while
dealing with such like offences, in the best interest of

the victim as well as the accused.
Page $0f6
10. Investigation in the case is complete and
accused-petitioner is no more required to the
prosecution for the very purpose. The accused-
petitioner is a minor and in view of the above stated
facts, his case calls for further inquiry under Sub-
Section (2) of Section 497 Cr.P.C as well, therefore,
the situation tilts the scales of justice towards bail

rather than jail.

11. Apart from the above, it has been held time and
again by the august Supreme Court that bail does not
mean acquittal of accused but only change of custody
from Government agencies to the sureties, who on
furnishing bonds take responsibility to produce the
accused whenever and wherever required to be
produced. Reliance could be placed on case reported in
2008 SCMR 807 “Haji Muhammad Nazir Vs State”.

12. Before parting with this order, this court finds it
necessary to mention that all the observations recorded
above are tentative assessment just for the disposal of
bail petition and not intended to influence the mind of
trial Court, which is free to appraise the evidence
strictly in accordance with law and merits of the case.

13. For what has been discussed above, this bail
application is allowed and accused-petitioner, named

above, is admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail

bonds in the sum of Rs.100,000/- (one lac), with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of
learned Illaqa/Duty Judicial Magistrate, who shall
ensure that the sureties are local, reliable and men of
means.

14. Above are the reasons of short order of even
date.
