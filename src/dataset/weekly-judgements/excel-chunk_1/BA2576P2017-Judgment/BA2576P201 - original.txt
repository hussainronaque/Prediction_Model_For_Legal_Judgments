MOHAMMAD IBRAHIM KHAN, J.- Here is the
bail petition preferred by Rehman Shah in
criminal case reported vide FIR No. 871 dated
15.10.2017 charged under sections
302,324,148,149 PPC registered at Police
Station Bhana Mari Peshawar, thereby looking

for the grant of bail after arrest.

2. Earlier, the accused/Petitioner was
declined bail by the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-XV Peshawar vide his order
dated 14.11.2017. The reasons advanced for
dismissal of the application are somewhat how

that "he is directly charged in the FIR. Recover

has been effected from his p erson. Medico-legal
report ‘and other " supporting documents
available on case file supports version of the
prosecution in its totality. Pointation memo has
been prepared which also supports version of
the_ complainant. At the moment _no substantial
material existing on the record which may
suggest innocence of the Petitioner/accused.
The _ Petitioner being charged for_the_offence
which entails capital punishment and_covered

under_the_prohibitory limb of section 497
Cr.P.C.

3. The facts given rise to the lodging
of the First Information Report are that
Shah Hassan the complainant was present along
with the corpus of his brother Shehzad Anwar.
There were also injured persons Khaliq Shah
and Ajmeer Shah. All of them present at the
venue known as Maskeen Abad near Sher Ali
eo “Brick Kiln Peshawar. There came the present
Petitioner Rehman Shah and his brother
Mehmand, Kamran, Haneef, Jehangir, . Miras

Khan, Hameesh Gul, Zafar Gul, Mir Gul

Nawab (S.B.) Hoo'’ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

Nausherawan, Feroz and Malak Irfan. All of |
them were armed with deadly weapons of the
type of Kalashnikovs and on seeing them started
firing at them which resulted the death of his
brother Shehzad Anwar whereas Khaliq Shah
and Ajmeer Shah received bullet injuries. He
(complainant) along with others got escaped un-
hurt. The motive behind the occurrence is

property dispute.

4. As apparently, later learned counsel
for the parties and learned A.A.G appearing on
behalf of the State have manifestly admitted that
the present case reported vide FIR No. 871 and
another case bearing FIR No. 872 are of cross
versions. Here the parties are the same. The
occurrence is of the same date and place where
almost the same time has been mentioned in

both the counter-version cases. Therefore, it

yore cannot be ascertained at this juncture that which

version in either case was true, who was the
aggressor and who had been aggressed upon as
it is yet to be determined by the learned trial

Court. In this regard, reliance has been placed

Nawab (S.B.) Hon‘ble Me. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.

the other given by the opposite-party

Nawab (S.B,) Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan.

. wba ee

case-law is almost settled that such
cases are covered Sor grant of bail on
the ground of further enquiry as
contemplated under section 497(2),
CrP.C. In such cafes normally, bail
is granted on the ground of further
enquiry for the reason that the
question as to which version is
correct is to be decided by the trial
Court which is supposed to record
evidence and also appraise the same
in order to come to a final conclusion
in this regard. In cases of counter-
versions, normally, plea of private
defence is taken giving rise to
question as to which party is
aggressor and which party is
aggressed. In the case of Fazal
Muhammad v. Ali Ahmad (1990
SCMR 391) in cross-cases the High
Court granted bail to the accused on
the ground that there was probability
of counter-version being true as some
of the accused had received injuries
including a grievous injury on the
head of one accused. It was held by

this Court that in such circumstances

yp the High Court was right in granting -
—

ee

bail and no interference was
warranted, In the same context,
reference can be made to the case of
Mst. Shafiqan v. Hashim Ali and
others (1972 SCMR 682).

Nawab (S.B.) Hon‘bte Mr. Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan

5. Last but not the least learned
counsel for rival parties have also affirmed that
the complainant of this case has no objection if
accused/petitioner from this side is granted bail.
In this context reliance has been placed on 2017
SCMR_1730_"Ghulam_ Abbas alias Gaiman
and _ others V/S_The State and others". The

relevant citation of the judgment speaks of:-

"Present case was a case of two
versions and two FIRs and it was
difficult to determine as to which
party was the aggressor. Counsel for
both sides had no objection if
accused persons from both sides were
granted bail. Bail was granted to

accused persons accordingly.
6. Where these cases FIR No. 871 and
FIR No. 872 dated 15.10.2017 of the same
Police Station Bhana Marai have been held and
admitted to be of cross version and in position
at this quandary it cannot be ascertained to give
p22 specific role to this Petitioner in this cross case.
Where the combined study of the facts would
fall the role of this Petitioner one of further

inquiry within the ambit of sub-section 2 of

Nawab (S.B.) Hon'ble Mr, Justice Mobammad Ibrablm Khan
section 497 Cr.P.C thereby the grant of bail
becomes right of the accused when the
complainant of the cross case has no objection

on the grant of bail. Thus it would be imperative

for the Court to grant bail.

7. Accordingly, on acceptance of this
petition the accused/Petitioner Rehman Shah
is admitted to bail subject to furnishing bail
bonds in the sum of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees
two lacs) with two sureties each in the like
amount to the satisfaction of learned Judicial
Magistrate concern, who shall ensure that the

sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

8. These are the reasons of my short

order of even date.
