Advocate.

SHAKEEL AHMAD, _J.--- Through this criminal

miscellaneous bail application, the petitioner Jeahan Daraz alias

Jahan Gully s/o Muhammad Khan seeks post-arrest bail in case

vide FIR No.110 dated 13.3.1998 registered U/S. 302 PPC at

Police Station sadder Bannu.

2. The prosecution case as disclosed in the FIR are

that on 13.3.1998 at 08:15 hours brought his brother Shahbaz

Khan in injured condition in the emergency room of civil

*Imranullah* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
hospital Bannu and reported the matter to the police that on the

eventful day he along-with his brother Shahbaz Khan and

paternal uncle Gul Hyder were present near Masjid Fatma Khel.

In the meanwhile, petitioner â€” accused while armed with riffle

appeared and attempted at the life of Shahbaz Khan by firing at

him as a result whereof Shahbaz Khan was injured seriously.

After commission of the offence, the accused fled-away from

the spot. The complainant could do nothing being empty

handed. The motive as alleged in the FIR is that Shahbaz Khan

injured had purchased house from maternal uncle of the

accused over which the petitioner was annoyed. Lateron,

Shahbaz Khan succumbed to his injuries, on the same day. at

11:00 AM, hence, petitioner was booked in the FIR.

3. On 10.3.2018 the petitioner was arrested

whereafter, he moved an application for release on bail, which

was declined by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-III,

Bannu vide order dated 11.5.2018, hence, this petition.

4. It is argued by the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode

*Imranullah* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
and manner as stated by the complainant; that site-plan, version

of the complainant and PM report if placed in juxta position are

contradictory inter alia; that the injured minor namely-Nasir

Khan whose presence was shown at point-2 of the site-plan, his

presence was not disclosed in the FIR,; that bail cannot be

denied merely on abscondence, if the case is other-wise fit for

grant of bail.

5. As against that the learned counsel appearing on

behalf of the complainant and the learned Addl: A.G

representing the State argued that the petitioner has specifically

been nominated in the FIR for committing murder of Shahbaz

Khan; that the occurrence took place in the broad day light,

therefore, there is no chance of mis-identification; that after

commission of the offence, accused remained at large for about

20 years, therefore, he does not deserve the concession of bail;

that trial has already commenced and charge has been framed

against the accused.

6. Arguments heard and record perused with the able

assistance of learned counsel for the parties.

*Imranullah* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
7. Perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner has

specifically been nominated in the FIR for committing murder

of the brother of complainant in a promptly lodged FIR ruling-

out the possibility of contemplation, deliberation and

consultation. Besides complainant, the occurrence was also

witnessed by paternal cousin of complainant namely-Gul

Hyder. After commission of offence, the petitioner remained

absconder for a period of about 20 years. The medicolegal

report supports the contention of the complainant. No doubt in

the FIR the petitioner is not charged for causing Fire-arm injury

to the minor Nasir Khan, but, subsequently it was disclosed that

the minor Nasir Khan also sustained injuries at the hands of the

petitioner, and his presence has been shown at Point-2 in the

site-plan.

8. Perusal of the record further reveals that the crime

in question having been taken place on 13.3.1998 while the

petitioner was arrested on 10.3.2018. It is settled law that

fugitive from law loses some of the normal rights granted by

the procedural and substantive law and noticeable abscondence

*Imranullah* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
dis-entitles the absoncer to the concession of bail

notwithstanding the merits of the case. In this respect reliance

can well be placed on the cases reported as Awal Khan and

others Vs The State (PLD 1985 SC 402) and Raza Khan Vs

State (2013 MD 810).
9. Moreso, the trial in the instant case has already

commenced and charge has been framed against the accused on

16.3.2018. Normally the Courts avoid to grant bail in the case

in which either the challan has been put in the Court and the

trial is likely to commence short or the trial has begun. In this

respect reliance can well be placed on the cases reported as

Mindad Vs. State (1992 SCMR 1448) and Syed Akbar and

another Vs. Gul Akbar and another (1996 SCMR 931).

10. In view of specific charge supported by the eye-

witnesses coupled with noticeable abscondence sufficiently

provide reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner is

guilty of an offence charged with which falls within the

prohibition contained in Section. 497 Cr.P.C, therefore, he is

not entitled to the concession of bail. This bail application fails

*Imranullah* (S.B.) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad, J
which is hereby dismissed. However, the trial Court is directed
to conclude the trial expeditiously within four (04) months.

Announced.
07.6.2018.
