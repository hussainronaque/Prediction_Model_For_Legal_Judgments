SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, _J:-
Appellants, Akhtar Saleem and his father, Fazal-i-
Rabbi, faced trial in case F.I.R No.117 dated
19.05.2012 under sections 302/34 PPC, Police Station
Baffa, Mansehra in the Court of learned Additional
Sessions Judge-II, Mansehra, and subsequently at the
conclusion of the trial, they both were held guilty of
‘Qatl-i-Amd’ of deceased Ghulam Mustafa and
Muhammad Asif, and consequently convicted under
section 302(b) PPC and sentenced to imprisonment
for life as ‘Tazir’ and were also held liable to pay

compensation of Rs.400,000/-each, under section
544-A Cr.P.C to the legal heirs of both the deceased,
or in default thereof, they shall further undergo eight
months simple imprisonment. Benefit of Section 382-
B Cr.P.C was also extended to the appellants.

2. The facts, as narrated in the F.I.R., lodged by
Habib-ur-Rehman, complainant, on 19/05/2015 at
09.00 hours that on that day he alongwith his sons
Ghulam Mustafa, Muhammad Asif and Shahbar Khan
son of Tahiroon was doing farming work in Tomatoes
crop, when at 08.30 hours, Fazal-i-Rabbi son of Allah
Dad and his son, Akhtar Saleem, duly armed with
firearms came there; that they altercated and Akhtar
Saleem fired at Ghulam Mustafa and Fazal-i-Rabbi
fired at Muhammad Asif, who both sustained injuries
and died on the spot. Motive for the offence was
stated to be desertion of wife of Saleem Akhtar,
appellant. The occurrence was stated to have
witnessed by Habib-ur-Rehman, complainant (PW-5),
Shahbar Khan (PW-6) and Feroz son of Alam.

3. The SHO, Hakam Khan, (PW-7), who

reached the spot on getting information about the
occurrence and found dead bodies of the deceased
lying in the fields. After reducing report of
complainant in shape of ‘Murasila’ (Ex.PA), he
prepared injury sheet (Ex.PW 7/1) and inquest report
(Ex.PW 7/2) of deceased Ghulam Mustafa and injury
sheet (Ex.PW 7/3) and inquest report (Ex.PW 7/4) of
deceased Muhammad Asif. He sent the dead bodies to
the Civil Hospital for postmortem examination
through constable, Tufail No.1120. He arrested
appellant Akhtar Saleem and recovered 12 bore
repeater bearing No.1200 FP 12GA (Ex.P-1) vide
recovery memo (Ex.PW 7/5) and registered a case
against him under section 13 A.O. After completion
of investigation, he submitted complete challan
against the accused in the case.

4. Appellants were formally charged by the
learned trial Court, who pleaded not guilty, and
claimed trial. The Prosecution examined as many as
eighteen witnesses to bring home charge against the
appellants. After close of the Prosecution evidence,

the appellants were examined under section 342,
Cr.P.C. who pleaded innocence and denied their
involvement in the commission of the crime. They did
not opt to appear on oath as their own witness, as
required under section 340(2) Cr.P.C. or to produce
defence evidence.

5. After hearing arguments, the learned trial
Court found the case of the prosecution to be based on
promptly lodged FIR, Malafide of complainant,
Ocular account furnished by P.Ws 05 and 06, Medical
Evidence, Circumstantial Evidence and Motive behind
the occurrence. Consequently, the learned trial Court
convicted and sentenced both the appellants as
mentioned hereinabove.

6. Appellants, Akhtar Saleem and Fazal-i-Rabbi
assailed the impugned judgment of the leanred trial
Court by filing instant Criminal Appeal _No.147-
A/2015, whereas, Habib-ur-Rehman, complainant
filed Criminal__ Revision _No.40-A/2015 for
enhancement of sentences awarded to appellants,
which are being disposed of through this single

judgment.
7. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties
heard and record of the case perused with their
valuable assistance.

8. Admittedly, the SHO himself on getting
information about the occurrence reached the spot and
found the dead bodies of both the deceased lying in
the fields, however, it could not be established as to
how the police got information about the occurrence.
Anyhow, the important piece of evidence in this case
is the ocular account, which has been furnished by
complainant Habib-ur-Rehman, (PW-5), father of
deceased and Shahbar Khan (PW-6), who was
allegedly residing in the cattle-shed of the
complainant. The complainant during  cross-
examination admitted that they had not informed the
police about the occurrence, however, the police came
to know about the occurrence from someone. He
showed his ignorance as to who had informed the
police. PW-6 also stated during cross-examination
that he has not informed the police. Moreover, they

have not raised hue and cry, when they saw appellants
having firearms in their hands coming towards them
or at-least they should have prevented them not to
altercate with the deceased or to make some efforts to
save them from the hands of appellants. This conduct
on the part of the complainant and eyewitnesses was
absolutely unnatural, as despite death of two persons,
they are not doing any effort to inform the police
about the occurrence, which creates doubts regarding
their presence at the spot at the relevant time. PW-7
SHO during cross-examination stated that he was in
PS when he received the information regarding the
occurrence between 8.00 to 8.30 AM, which was
conveyed to him by the Moharrar of the PS. PW-5
during cross-examination stated that they remained at
the spot from 7.00 AM to 11.00 AM, whereas, PW-6
stated that he remained present at the spot up to 1.00
P.M. and he did not go anywhere during this period
and remained at the spot. He further stated that PW
Feroz and complainant also remained with him at the
spot throughout this period. Moreover, PW-6 stated

that at the time of occurrence, Asif deceased was
working in his own land, whereas, in the site plan
(Ex.PW 18/1), the deceased Asif was shown present
at point No.3, which was the land of one Raheem
Khan. In this way, the statements of both the
eyewitnesses are contradictory with the I.O. who
prepared the site plan on their pointation. Moreover,
the complainant stated that they were working in their
field, whereas, other people were also working in their
field and after the occurrence, those who working in
their field, they also arrived at the spot. He showed
ignorance about their names. PW-6 contradicted the
complainant in this regard by saying that there was no
other person in the surrounding fields at the time of
occurrence. Similarly, PW-5, complainant stated that
soon after the occurrence PWs Behram and Attae
Khan, related to him, came to the spot, whereas, this
statement of complainant was contradicted by PW-6,
who stated during cross examination that after the
occurrence police arrived at the spot and no other civil
person arrived there. Moreover, PW-5 admitted in his

cross-examination that they were busy in farming
work, with the pick-axes in the Tomatoes fields,
however, the same were neither produced to the I.O
nor the I.O had taken the same into his possession. All
these material contradictions in the statements of both
the alleged eyewitnesses would lead to obvious
inference that the occurrence was not witnessed by
them and their presence at the spot was doubtful. The
medical evidence also not supported the version of the
complainant. The complainant in his statement
though have not disclosed the exact time of taking
breakfast, however, he stated that they had their
breakfast just before leaving the house at 6.30 AM,
whereas, the Dr. Muhammad Amjad Khan, who
conducted postmortem examination on the dead
bodies of the deceased found digested food in their
stomach, which showed that deceased might had
taken food 4 to 5 hours prior to the occurrence. Thus,
the ocular account furnished by the eyewitnesses is in
clear conflict with the medical evidence. Therefore,
the evidence of the alleged eyewitnesses in peculiar

facts and circumstances of the case could not be
believed. The Honourable Apex Court in Mst. Sughra
Begum’s Case (2015 SCMR 1142) has held that:

“It is cardinal principle of justice that
ocular account in such cases plays a
decisive and vital role and once its intrinsic
worth is accepted and believed then the rest
of the evidence, both circumstantial and
corroboratory in nature, would be required
as a matter of caution. To the contrary, once
the ocular account is disbelieved then no
other evidence, even of a high degree and
value, would be sufficient for recording
conviction on a capital charge”

9. Thus, in view of above material
contradictions, the ocular account furnished by the
complainant and eyewitnesses (PW-5 and PW-6) is
not trustworthy, therefore, their testimonies in these
peculiar circumstances could never be relied upon in a
case involving capital punishment unless corroborated
by independent, impartial, non-partisan and trust-
worthy witnesses. No independent person was
produced, if at all, they were present at the spot at the
time of occurrence in the nearby fields, as alleged by
PW-15.

10. Similarly, the recovery of 12 bore shot gun on
the pointation of the appellant Fazal-i-Rabbi or

recovery of 12 bore shotgun from possession of
10

appellant Akhtar Saleem at the time of his arrest could
not be proved and the marginal witnesses to the
recovery memos, namely, Khalil-ur-Rehman (PW-3),
Gujar Khan (PW-8) were related to the complainant
and no independent person was associated by the I.O
to prove the said recovery. Moreover, the I.O had
taken into possession two empty shells of 12 bore
from the spot, where presence of appellants Akhtar
Saleem and Fazal-i-Rabbi was shown in the site plan,
however, the empty shell allegedly recovered from the
place of appellant Fazal-i-Rabbi does not match with
the 12 bore shot gun recovered on his pointation.
Thus, the recovery of alleged 12 bore shot gun from
possession of appellant Akhtar and positive report of
the firearms expert would be of no avail to the
prosecution.

11. The motive which is alleged by the
complainant in the present case does not relate
directly to the deceased party. The wife of appellant
Akhtar Saleem is daughter of Attai Khan (PW-17),

therefore, the aversion, if any, exists on the part of the
11

appellants would be with the family of his wife and
not the complainant, who is maternal grandfather of
his wife. Thus, the motive in view of peculiar facts
and circumstances of the present case would not be
considered sufficient to prompt the appellants to
commit the murder of deceased.

12. The above factors, material contradictions
between ocular and medical evidence create serious
doubts in the happening of alleged occurrence and it is
well settled law that even a single doubt, if found
reasonable, would entitle the accused person to
acquittal and not a combination of several doubts.
Reliance is placed on case titled ‘Ghulam Qadir Vs.
The State’ (2008 SCMR 1221), wherein, it has held

that:

“Tt needs no reiteration that for the purpose
of giving benefit of doubt to an accused
person, more than one infirmity is not
required, a_ single infirmity crating
reasonable doubt in the mind of a
reasonable and prudent mind regarding the
truth of charge-makers the whole case
doubtful. Merely because the burden is on
accused to prove his innocence it does not
absolve the prosecution to prove its case
against the accused beyond any shadow of
doubt in this duty does not change or vary in
the case.”
12

Reliance is also placed on case law reported as_2009
SCMR 230, 1995 SCMR 1345, 2017 SCMR 596 and
2017 SCMR 709.

13. Thus, this Court, in the light of above
discussion, is of considered opinion that the charge
against the present appellants-convicts has not been
proved beyond any shadow of doubt and the findings
of the learned trial Court qua conviction of the
appellants were based on wrong and improper
appreciation of evidence, which requires interference
by this Court in its Appellate jurisdiction.

14. As a sequel to what has been discussed above,
this appeal is accepted and the impugned conviction
recorded and the sentences imposed by the learned
Additional Sessions Judge-IJ, Mansehra_ on
10.12.2015 are hereby set aside and the appellants are
acquitted of the charges under section 302 PPC.
Appellants are directed to be released forthwith, if not
required in any other case.

15. In view of acquittal of appellants, the

Criminal Revision No.40-A/2015 filed by petitioner
13

for enhancement of sentence of the appellants, stands
dismissed.
Above are the detailed reasons for short

order of this Court of even date.
