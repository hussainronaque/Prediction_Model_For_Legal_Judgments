(Judicial Department)

Cr.M.BA. No.420-M/2015.

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 10.11.2015.

Petitioner (Aziz Ullah) by Qazi Farid Ahmad Advocate

Respondent/State by Mr. Sabir Shah AAG.

MUHAMMAD DAUD KHAN, J.- Through instant petition,
Aziz Ullah, the petitioner, seeks post arrest bail in case FIR
No.966 dated 16.12.2014, registered u/ss 302 PPC/ 13 AO, P.S.
Mingora, District Swat.

2. As per prosecution case, petitioner after
committing murder of his sister Seema Gul and one Lal Bahadar
by firing at them with pistol, was over powered by the local
police alongwith crime pistol and a case vide FIR mentioned
above was registered against him.

3. It is pertinent to mention that the prayer of
petitioner for his release on bail has been rejected on merit by the
learned lower Court and during pendency of his bail petition on
merit before this Court, it was dismissed as withdrawn. The
petitioner moved the lower Court on fresh ground of compromise

effected between the parties, which was refused vide order dated
20.10.2015, hence the instant petition for release of petitioner on
the basis of compromise.

4. Learned counsel for petitioner mainly stressed the
release of petitioner on the basis of compromise effected between
the parties. As per record it is a case of honor killing which has
been lodged on the report of petitioner who was arrested red
handed on the spot alongwith crime pistol after committing
murder of his sister alongwith one Lal Bahadar on the pretext of
Karo-Kari(Honor killing) as his sister had run away with the said
Lal Bahadar, which is duly supported by the recoveries of blood
and empties from the places of both the deceased as well as their
Post Mortem Reports. Though in the lower Court, the legal heirs
of both the deceased had produced compromise with the
petitioner and recorded their statements in respect of compromise
but the same cannot be taken into consideration at this stage.
Section 302 PPC is compoundable but according to Section 345
Cr.PC, in cases of â€˜Karo Kari' (Honor Killing), Section 302 PPC
has not been declared as compoundable. The offence with which
the petitioner is charged falls under the prohibitory clause of
Section 497 Cr.PC. Besides, trial against the petitioner has been
commenced and most of prosecution witnesses have been
examined and the trial could be concluded in the near future,
therefore, petitioner is not entitled to the concession of bail at this

stage.
In view of above, this petition being devoid of any
force is dismissed. However, the learned trial Court is directed to
conclude the trial expeditiously.

The above observations of this Court should be
considered tentative in nature and in no way prejudice the case of
either party during trial.
