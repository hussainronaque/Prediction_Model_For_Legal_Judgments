LUDGMENT
MUSARRATFOLALL J.- - Sher Wali seeks his post arrest bail in

case FIR No. 1618, dated 10.11.2021, under sections 9(d)
CNSA, registered at police station, Badhber, District Peshawar.
Earlier, for the same relief, he had approached the lower forum,
but his petition was rejected by learned Judge, Special Court,

Peshawar, vide order dated 02.12.2021.

2. As per prosecution story, on 10.1 1.2021 Yousaf Shah SI

‘along with other police contingent was on patrol duty, when

received information as to smuggling of charas from Dara Adam
Khel to Peshawar, therefore, in the backdrop, he arranged
‘nakabandi’ at Zangli Check Post, when at 1500 hours, a
motorcar bearing registration No. IDB-3339 arrived which was
stopped for the purpose of checking. The driver disclosed his
name as Sher Wali (petitioner) and from his personal possession,
nothing incriminating was recovered, however, during cursory
interrogation, on his pointation, 20 packets of charas, total

weighing 20690 grams, were recovered from the secret cavities
made in the CNG tank of the motorcar, accordingly, the above
referred case FIR was registered against him.

3. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioner and
learned AAG appearing on behalf of the State at length; it
appears from the record that, no doubt, the petitioner was
driving the motorcar at the relevant time but the narcotics were
recovered from the secret cavities made in CNG tank of the
motorcar. It has now been well settled that while granting or
refusing bail to an accused person, the Court is not required to
see and consider the evidence/ material collected in favour of the
persecution only, but also has to give proper attention to the plea
taken by the accused as in the instant case, where during
investigation of the case, the petitioner in his statement recorded
under section 161 Cr.P.C gave details of the event as to how by
taking advantage of his ignorance, the vehicle in which the chars
was kept in the secret cavities, was handed over to him by co-
accused Sajid. According to his statement, the charas and the
motorcar were owned by co-accused Sajid and Abdur Rahim
and he was not in conscious knowledge of the same,
accordingly, in the light of statement of the petitioner, co-
accused Sajid and Abdur Rahim were also arrayed as accused in
the case. Besides other material so far collected by the

investigating officer, the CDR data available on record also
supported the version of the accused-petitioner. This Court in
the case titled Shah Zaib vs. the State (2014 P.Cr. L J 494, has
held that, though, statement recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C
by an accused person is not admissible in evidence as per
provision of Article 38 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984,
but once a statement recorded by police themselves, bringing on
record prima facie detachment of an accused of commission of
the offence in question, then the same at least may be considered

for the purpose of bail. Reliance is also placed on the case titled

Raza and another vs the State and two others ( PLD 2020
S.C 523).

4. In the above context, learned AAG appearing on behalf
of State after going through the file also confirms that nothing
was recovered from personal possession of the petitioner and
that he did not make an attempt to run away from the spot, when
the police signaled the vehicle to stop, however, he submitted
that the petitioner was driving the vehicle, therefore, it can be
safely presumed that he was having conscious knowledge of the
narcotics concealed in that vehicle. It has now been well settled
that a criminal case is to be decided on the basis of evidence
collected by the prosecution and suspicion, howsoever, grave or
strong could never be a proper substitute for the standard of

proof required in a criminal case, i.e., beyond reasonable doubt.
Rel: (PLD 2019 S C 592). For constitution of an offence, mens
rea and the element of conscious knowledge coupled with
conscious participation on the part of the accused are the sine
qua non and the august Supreme Court in the case titled
"Manzoor and 4 others v. The State" [PLD 1972 SC 81] has
held that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment. It has further
been held that there is no legal or moral compulsion to keep
people in jail merely on the allegation that they have committed
offences punishable with death or transportation, unless
reasonable grounds appear to exist to disclose their complicity as
the ultimate conviction and incarceration of a guilty person can
repair the wrong caused by a mistaken relief of interim bail
granted to him, but no satisfactory reparation can be offered to
an innocent man for his unjustified incarceration at any stage of
the case albeit his acquittal in the long run. Therefore, in view of
the above discussion and while driving guidance from the case
law, referred to above, the question as to whether the petitioner
was having conscious knowledge of narcotics concealed in the
secret cavities of the vehicle requires serious consideration,
which shall be determined by the learned trial Court after
recording evidence. In the circumstances, case against the
petitioner calls for further inquiry falling within the ambit of

section 497(2) Code of Criminal Procedure.
5. Likewise, the petitioner was arrested in the case on
10.11.2021 and remained in jail for five months, yet challan has
not been put in court, as such, there is no prospect of the
commencement of trial in the near future let alone its conclusion
and this factor also tilt the scales of justice in favour of bail
rather than Jail, particularly, when there is nothing on record to
show that the petitioner was either previous convict or involved
in the like nature cases.

6. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the instant
petition is allowed, resultantly, the petitioner is directed to be
released on bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of
rupees two lac with two sureties each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of learned trial court, who shall ensure that the
sureties are local, reliable and men of means.

Before parting with this judgment it is pertinent to
mention that the above observations, mentioned herein above,
are tentative in nature which shall not influence the trial court
during trial.

Above are the reasons of short order of even date.
