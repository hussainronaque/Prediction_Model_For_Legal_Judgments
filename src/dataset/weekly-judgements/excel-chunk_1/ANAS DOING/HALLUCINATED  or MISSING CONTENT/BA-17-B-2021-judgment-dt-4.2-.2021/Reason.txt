The Court's Approach to Bail

The judgment explains that courts must not conduct deep evidence appreciation at the bail stage but should apply judicial scrutiny to avoid miscarriages of justice. This principle is missing from the AI summary.

"The prosecution likely argued..."

The summary states that the prosecution "likely" argued specific points, which means it is making assumptions rather than relying on the actual judgment. The judgment does not explicitly mention what the prosecution argued beyond stating that they opposed the bail.
