Misc.petition No.186-B of 2018, petitioner
Irfanullah S/O Saee-ur-Rahman alias Saki seeks
post arrest bail in crime report No.559 dated
25.11.2017, registered under sections 302/ 324/
109/148/149 PPC of Police Station Yaqoob Khan

Shaheed, district Karak.

IN

The prosecution story as given in the crime

report, is that complainant Kamal Khana wife of Khan
Wali reported to the police at Emergency Ward of Civil
Hospital Takht-e-Nasrati that on 25.11.2017 at 0900
hours, she and her brother Wali Khan while coming
from house situated in Wanki to Garang Siraj Kjel,
accused Shams ur Rehman, Khalil Rehman, sons of
Sawab Rehman and accused/petitioner Irfanullah, who
were already sitting in ambush, came out of their Hujra
and started firing at them with the intention to commit
their qatl-i-amd with deadly weapons, resultantly she
(complainant) was hit and got injured, while her brother
Khan Wali was also got hit and died on the spot; that
the accused committed the offence on the instigation of
Sawab Rehman and Mst. Chanara. Motive as disclosed
in the FIR is previous blood feud enmity. Hence her
report was culminated into FIR (ibid).

3. After arrest, the petitioner applied for
post arrest, which was declined by the learned

Additional Sessions Judge, Karak at Takht-e-

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

Nasrati, vide order dated 12.6.2018. Hence, this
petition.

4. It has been contended by the learned
counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is
innocent and has falsely been implicated in the
instant case; that from the perusal of the site plan,
point No.1 is not visible from points No.2,3, & 4;
that the medicolegal report and the MLC of the
injured does not support the version of the
complainant; that prima facie, there exists no
reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner has
committed the alleged offence; that the prosecution
case requires further inquiry into the guilt of the
accused/petitioner; that at the time of alleged
occurrence, accused/petitioner was present in Quetta
in connection with his official duty in the School of
Infantry and Tactics Quetta Cantonment and this
fact has been affirmed during inquiry; that co-

accused Sawab-ur Rahman has already been

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
released on bail by this Court vide order dated
18.02.2018, therefore keeping in view principle of
consistency, the accused/ petitioner is also entitled
to be released on bail.

5. Conversely, the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the complainant and the
learned A.A.G representing the State vehemently
opposed the contention of the learned counsel for
the petitioner and argued that the petitioner has
specifically been charged for committing murder of
brother of the complainant; ; that plea of alibi taken
by the petitioner is concocted one and afterthought,
therefore not worth consideration at this stage; that
after commission of offence the petitioner remained
at large for a noticeable period; that the trial has
already been commenced; that the offence with
which the petitioner is charged , falls within the
prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C, therefore

he does not deserve the concession of bail.

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.
t~

6. I have heard arguments of learned
counsel for the parties and perused the record with
their valuable assistance.

7. Perusal of the record reveals that
petitioner is one of the nominated accused, who has
specifically been charged for committing murder of
brother of the complainant. In the instant incident,
the complainant herself sustained bullet injury on
her thigh. The perusal of PM report would show that
the deceased Wali Khan has sustained multiple
injuries on his body. The parties are known to each
other, therefore there is no chance of mis-
identification. The motive as alleged in the FIR is
previous blood feud enmity between the parties.
After commission of offence, the petitioner
remained at large for quite sufficient time, he was
declared proclaimed offender.

8. The role attributed to the co-accused

Sawab ur Rahm, who has been granted bail by this

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

Court, is distinguishable. The record reflects that he
has been attributed role of abetement while role of
firing at the complainant party was attributed to the
accused/petitioner

Adverting to plea of alibi, suffice is to
say that it was not taken in the earliest.
10. No doubt plea of alibi like other
defence plea taken at bail stage is essentially
required to be examined by the Court within a
degree of care and caution. This belated plea of
alibi, prima facie creates an impression that it was
after thought. However, I leave its evidentiary value
to be decided by the learned trial Court after
recording pro and contra evidence.
11. In view of specific charge supported by
the eye-witnesses, medical evidence and un-
explained noticeable abscondence sufficiently
provide reasonable grounds to believe that the

petitioner is guilty of an offence charged with,

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

petitioner is guilty of an offence charged with,
which falls within the prohibitory Clause of Section
497 Cr.P.C.

12. It is pertinent to mention here that after
completion of investigation challan has been
submitted and trial is likely to commence soon. In -
such situation, it has all long been settled principle
of law, set by august Supreme Court of Pakistan,
when the trial is likely to commence or has begun,
bail application should not be decided on merits and
the matter be left to the trial Court, lest it may
prejudice case of either side. In this respect, reliance
can well be placed on the cases reported as
Muhammad Sadiq & other Vs.. The State (1980
SCMR 203), Muhammad Ismail..VS.. Muhammad

Rafique & other (PLD 1989 SC_585), Mian Dad

Vs. The State and another (1992 SCMR_ 1418

A/Awan* (S.B) Mr. Justice Shakeel Ahmad.

C

(1992_SCMR_ 931) and Shahid Farooq Vs..The
State and others (2011 SCMR 1619).

13. For what has been discussed above,
there is no merits in this petition, which is hereby
dismissed.

It is clarified that any observations
made in this order is tentative in nature, confined
only to the extent of bail matter which would not
influence the mind of the trial Court in any manner
who shall decide the case by applying its own
independent judicial mind after recording evidence.
