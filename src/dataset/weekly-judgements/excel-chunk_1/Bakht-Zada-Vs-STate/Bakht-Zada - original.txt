JUDGMENT

ASSADULLAH KHAN CHAMMKANI, _J.- Petitioner

Bakht Zada, being abortive to get the concession of bail from
two Courts below, through this further application seeks the
same concession from this court in case FIR No.582 dated
10.09.2013, registered under sections 302/148/149 PPC, at
Police Station Saddar Mardan, wherein he along with
co-accused Jehan Noor, Irshad, Shamshad, Siraj and
Muhammad Zada, is charged for committing the Qatl-e-Amd of
Akbar Ali deceased with firearms on the basis of previous blood
feud.

2. Arguments of learned counsel for the parties and

learned AAG for the State heard and record perused with their

able assistance.

3. It appears from the record that in her initial
report, Mst. Hamida complainant, charged directly six accused
including the petitioner for committing the murder of Akbar Alli
deceased her brother-in-law, by attributing the role of firing to
all the accused, however, she later on, in the site plan
assigned the role of firing to absconding co-accused Irshad
and Shamshad and charged the present petitioner for
abetment by showing his presence on the spot duly armed
with firearm. No crime empty has been recovered from the
place of the petitioner as indicated in the site plan. When no
overt act has been assigned to the petitioner, in the
circumstances, whether the petitioner was present at the
scene of occurrence and if at all he was, whether he shared
common intention and abetted the offence, are the debatable
questions to be answered by the prosecution during trial,
however, at the moment these make the case of the
accused/petitioner arguable for the purpose of bail. Guidance
in this regard may be derived from unreported judgment of
the apex court in Criminal Petition No.16 —P of 2015,
titled, “Sahibzada Vs The State and another” decided on
11.03.2015. It is settled law that bail may not be refused
merely on the ground that accused is directly charged in the
F.I.R for a heinous offence, when otherwise, he is found
entitled to concession of bail because any mistaken relief of

bail, can be repaired by convicting the accused, if proved

guilty at the trial, but no proper reparation can be offered for
his unjustified incarceration, albeit, his acquittal in the long
run.

4. For the reasons discussed above, this petition is
allowed. Petitioner is directed to be released on bail provided
he furnishes bail bonds in the sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two
sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of learned
Illagqa Judicial Magistrate/MOD, concerned.

Announced.

JUDGE

maintained that the learned Trial Court has the

jurisdiction to entertain the suit and in case of

decision of issue of the jurisdiction in favour of the
petitioners, after conclusion of trail, it would be
respondent to suffer and she is ready to face the
consequences of such scenario. He while supporting
the impugned orders, sought dismissal of the instant
petition.

5. Come what may, the issue raised, being a
mixed question of law and fact, can properly be
resolved, after recording pro and contra evidence of
the parties by the learned Trial Court. In view of the
above, the impugned orders of both the courts below
are set aside and the matter is remanded to the
learned Trial Court with the direction to frame a
specific issue (qua) jurisdiction, if already not framed,
to afford an opportunity to the parties for leading
their evidence and then to decide the suit on merits
in accordance with law. The learned Trial Court shall

conclude the trial as early as possible, but not later than

4 months, on receipt of the record. Office shall ensure
