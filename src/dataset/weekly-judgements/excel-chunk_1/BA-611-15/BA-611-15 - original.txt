QAISER RASHID KHAN, _J. Petitioner,
Inamullah Khan, seeks bail in case FIR No. 82 dated
18.3.2015 under sections 15-AA/ 16-AA, Police Station
Lachi District Kohat after being refused the said relief
by the learned courts below.

2. According to the FIR, on the eventful day Sadaat
Khan SHO alongwith other police contingents were on
gasht of the area when received spy information about
the smuggling of huge quantity of arms and
ammunitions from Dara Adam Khel to Bannu
whereupon a nakabandi was laid on the spot and in the
meanwhile, motorcar bearing registration No. V 8757
Sindh appeared which was stopped for the purpose of

checking. Search of the motorcar led to the recovery of
huge quantity of arms and ammunitions, hence the FIR
ibid.

3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that
the accused-petitioner is innocent and has been falsely
implicated in the instant case; that there is no
incriminating material available on the record to connect
the accused-petitioner with the commission of the
offence; that the story of the prosecution is concocted
and against the real facts, hence the case being one of
further enquiry the accused-petitioner is entitled to be
enlarged on bail.

4. The learned State counsel opposed the grant of
bail on almost similar grounds as mentioned in the
impugned orders.

Arguments heard and available record perused.

5. The main thrust of the arguments of the learned
counsel for the petitioner is that the offence for which
the accused-petitioner is charged does not attract the
prohibitory limb of section 497 Cr.P.C and thus the
accused-petitioner is entitled to the concession of bail. I
am afraid such contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is not relevant in every matter and each case
has to be decided on the basis of its own set of facts and
circumstances. Reliance is placed on “Shameel Ahmad

Vs. The State” (2009 SCMR 174) wherein it has been
held by the august apex court that grant of bail in cases
not falling within the domain of prohibition clause of
proviso to section 497 Cr.P.C is not a rule of universal
application and each case has to be seen through its own
facts and circumstances.

6. In the case in hand undoubtedly huge quantity of
arms of various bores and similarly thousands of
cartridges of different bores were recovered from the
secret cavities of the vehicle driven by the accused-
petitioner for which he could neither offer any proper
explanation nor produce any valid permit. Moreover, in
the present day scenario when terrorism and other
related crimes have taken the whole country by storm,
the carrying of such arms and ammunitions definitely
raise eye-brows. Thus being prima facie linked with the
commission of the offence, the accused-petitioner is
held disentitled to the grant of bail. Resultantly, this bail
application is dismissed.

7. Before parting with this order, it is directed that
any observations recorded in this order, being purely
tentative in nature, should in no way prejudice the
proceedings before the learned trial Court where the
case be decided on its own merits after recording
evidence.
