SAHIBZADA_ASADULLAH,_J.--- The petitioners after
having been booked in case F.ILR No. 789 dated 13.12.2020
under section 302/34 P.P.C, Police Station Yaqoob Khan
Shaheed, District, Karak applied for post-arrest bail to the
Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Takht-e-Nasrati,
District Karak, which was declined vide Order dated

26.02.2021, hence, this petition.

2. Brief facts of the case are that the complainant
while accompanying the dead-body of her deceased son,
Talha Javed, reported the matter in the emergency room of
Civil Hospital, Takht-e-Nasrati, District Karak, that she
along with her son (deceased), and brother-in-law, were

proceeding towards the house of her in-laws, when they

-2-

reached to the place of incident, the accused Muhammad
Rafiq and Muhammad Khurshid sons of Jehan Shah,
appeared duly armed and started firing at her son (the
deceased), who got hit and fell to the ground, whereas she
and her brother-in-law escaped unhurt; that the deceased was
taken for treatment to Civil Hospital Takht-e-Nasrati, where
after getting first aid the deceased then injured was referred
to the D.H.Q Hospital, Karak, for further treatment, on
reaching there the doctors declared the injured dead. On
having been satisfied regarding the death of the deceased,
they brought back the dead-body to the Hospital, where the

matter was reported. Hence, the F.I.R (bid)

3. The learned counsel for the parties alongwith
Addl: Advocate General were heard at length and with their

valuable assistance the record was gone through.

4. While scanning the record it surfaced that the
incident occurred at 11:20 hours, whereas the matter was
reported at 13:40 hours, and the Police Station is situated at a
distance of 3/4 kilometers from the spot. Though the
deceased then injured was allegedly taken to the Civil
Hospital, Takht-e-Nasrati and first aid was provided, but

surprisingly the medico-legal report was not prepared and
-3-
the deceased then injured was allegedly referred to D.H.Q

Hospital, Karak. It is pertinent to. mention that the hospital,
where the deceased then injured was initially taken, has its
own reporting center, but the matter was not reported there.
The complainant introduced one constable Sajid Iqbal, who
allegedly asked the injured regarding the culprits and that the
deceased then injured disclosed the petitioners as the
culprits, but the said Sajid Iqbal when examined under
section 161 Cr.P.C, did not mention the same. The record is
silent regarding the initial examination of the deceased then
injured and his capability to talk. These are the matters
which are to be thrashed out by the trial Court after
recording pro and contra evidence. This is yet to be
established as to whether, in fact, the deceased was rushed in
injured condition to the hospital and as to whether the
complainant was present at the time when the incident
occurred, as despite blood feud the complainant and the eye-

witness escaped unhurt.

5. One of the accused/ petitioner submitted an
application to the local police regarding his innocence, that
on the day and time of incident he was present in Tehsil
Courts, Takht-e-Nasrati, the application was marked to the

concerned Investigating Officer who visited the Courts and

-4-

recoded statements of witnesses including advocates in
respect of the presence of the petitioner in the Court
premises at the time of incident. True that the genuineness
of the plea of alibi cannot be thrashed out at bail stage and
it is the domain of the trial Court to determine the same, but
equally true that the Courts seized of bail matters can look

into its veracity for limited purpose. As is held in case

titled, “Zaigham Ashraf Vs the State and others’ (2016
SCMR 18).

“7, In the case of Khalid Javed Gillan v.
The State (PLD 1978 SC 256), broader
principles were laid down with regard to
accepting the plea of alibi of accused in
that case, making tentative assessment
of the materials brought on record and it

was held as follows:-

"§. 497---Bail---Assessment of
evidence---Court, in matters of
bail, to go by its assessment of the
common course of natural events,
human conduct, and public and
private business, in their relation
to the facts of the particular case-
--Prosecution though may prove
a prosecution witness to be man
of unimpeachable character for
purpose of bail, however, hostile
relationship between parties a
circumstance not irrelevant to
Court's assessment of material

produced before it---Petitioner's

-5-
plea of alibi supported by
affidavit of a disinterested person,
a medical practitioner of high
repute, not having any ostensible
connection with petitioner---Bail
absence of proof of Doctor's
evidence being not fit to be relied
upon, held, could not be properly
refused---Impugned order being
based on misreading of S.497,
petitioner ordered to be released

on bail."
6. There is no denial to the fact that the deceased
received one firearm injury for which two real brothers are
charged and it is yet to be determined by the trial Court that
whose fire shot proved fatal, as the injury caused does not

commensurate with the number of accused.

7. The question as to whether the benefit of doubt
if arises out of the attending circumstances of the case, can
be looked into, to favour the accused at bail stage, was

answered in affirmative by the apex Court in case titled

“Muhammad Faisal Vs_the State_and_ another” (2020

SCMR 971).

“The accumulative effect of all these facts
and circumstances create doubt regarding
truthfulness of prosecution version. It is
established principle of law that benefit of
doubt can be extended at bail.

-6-

8. True that while seized of a bail matters
tentative assessment is to be made and deeper appreciation
is not warranted, but equally true that bail applications
cannot be decided in vacuum and the Courts seized of bail
matter should apply its judicial mind to the collected
evidence brought before, so to avoid miscarriage of justice.

This is what is held by the apex Court in its case titled

“Zaigham Ashraf Vs _the State and others’ (2016 SCMR
18).

“9, To curtail the liberty of a person is a
serious step in law, therefore, the Judges
shall apply judicial mind with deep
thought for reaching at a fair and proper
conclusion albeit tentatively however, this
exercise shall not to be carried out in
vacuum or in a flimsy and casual manner
as that will defeat the ends of justice
because if the accused charged, is
ultimately acquitted at the trial then no
reparation or compensation can be
awarded to him for the long
incarceration, as the provisions of
Criminal Procedure Code and the scheme
of law on the subject do not provide for
such arrangements to repair the loss,
caused to an accused person, detaining
him in Jail without just cause and

reasonable ground.”

The cumulative effect of what has been stated above, leaves no

room to hold that the petitioners have been succeeded in

-7-

making out a case for bail, resultantly, this bail petition is
allowed and the accused/ petitioners Muhammad Rafiq and
Muhammad Khursheed are admitted to bail, subject to
furnishing bail bonds amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-(two lac) each
with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of

Illaqa Judicial Magistrate/ MOD concerned.

9. Above are the detailed reasons of my short order of

the even date.
