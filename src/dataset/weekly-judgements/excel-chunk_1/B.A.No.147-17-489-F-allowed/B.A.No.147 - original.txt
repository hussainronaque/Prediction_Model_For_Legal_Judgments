Kamran Mukhtiar
Vs.
The State and another

JUDGMENT

Date of hearing 03.05.2017

Appellant-Petitioner

Respondent

SYED MUHAMMAD ATTIQUE SHAH, J.- The

petitioner, Kamran Mukhtiar Qureshi seeks his release

on bail, in case F.I.R No.1210, dated 01.11.2016 under

section 489-F PPC, Police Station City, Mansehra.

2. Briefly stated facts of the case as

mentioned in the F.I.R mentioned above, are that the

accused/ petitioner had issued a cheque bearing

No.07206421 dated 22.2.2016 amounting to
Rs.22,00,000/- of United Bank Limited Mughalpura

Road, Lahore in favour of the complainant, on account

of outstanding amount for purchase of vehicle (Toyota

Coaster), which on presentation before the Bank was

dishonoured due to insufficient amount in the account.

3 I have heard the arguments of the learned

counsel for the parties as well as learned Addl: A.G for

the State and have gone through the record.

4, Perusal of the record reveals that accused/

petitioner had issued the cheque in question on

22.2.2016 which was presented to the concerned bank

firstly on 25.2.2016 and the same was dishonoured due

to insufficiency of amount in the account. The same

was later on again presented to the said bank on

16.8.2016 and once again the same was dishonoured for

the said reason. Therefore, the complainant lodged the

report on 26.10.2016.
5. The record further reveals that admittedly

there was a transaction between the complainant and

accused/petitioner for the purchase of vehicle (Toyota

Coaster), which was not fulfilled by the

accused/petitioner as narrated in the F.IL.R by the

complainant. Moreover, there is a decision of Jirga

dated 29.9.2015 available on record of the case signed

by the accused/petitioner, complainant and witnesses

regarding return of the disputed amount, which clearly

makes the case one of business transaction between the

accused/petitioner and complainant. Furthermore, a

civil suit for rendition of account etc between the

accused/petitioner and complainant is shown pending

before the Court of Senior Civil Judge, Lahore filed on

22.6.2016. Copy of the same has been annexed with the

record of present bail application. The present

accused/petitioner has been arrested in the present case
on 07.11.2016. The investigation in the case in hand is

complete, rather trial has also been commenced.

6. The offence with which the accused/

petitioner is charged does not fall within the prohibitory

clause of section 497 (1) CrPC as maximum

punishment provided for the offence is three years or

fine or both and in such like cases grant of bail is a rule,

while refusal is an exception to that rule.

7. It is also one of the important aspect of the

case that the offence for which the accused/ petitioner is

charged with having lesser punishment and if he

remained in jail for longer time and ultimately the

prosecution failed to establish guilt against him, then

long detention in jail would cause loss to the accused/

petitioner and his liberty would be curtailed without

any legal justification.
8. In view of what has been discussed above,
this petition is allowed and the accused/petitioner is
admitted to bail provided he furnishes bail bonds to the
sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (one lac) with two sureties each in
the like amount to the satisfaction of Illaqa/Duty
Judicial Magistrate, who shall ensure that the sureties

are local, reliable and men of means.

9. Any observation made in the order being
tentative in nature shall not affect the trial of the case
in any manner.
10. Above are the reasons for the short order
of even date.
