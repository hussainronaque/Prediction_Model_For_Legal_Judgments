JUDGMENT

Date of hearing: 26" July, 2017

Petitioner(s): (Sabir Khan) by Ms. Farhana Marwat, Adv:
Respondent(s): (State) by Mr. Tariq Kakar, Advocate.

MUHAMMAD AYUB KHAN, J.- Sabir Khan,

petitioner herein, who is charged in a case registered against

him and another under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic
Substances Act, 1997, vide FIR No.15, dated 25.03.2015 in
Police Station ANF (Peshawar) has sought his release on bail
only on statutory ground as he is languishing behind the bars

since 25.03.2015 and his trial should have been concluded up-

till now but hasn’t been done so, therefore, he is entitled to be

released on bail on this score alone, notwithstanding, merits of

the case.

2. As against that the learned counsel appearing on
behalf of the State vehemently argued that in view of the
recovery of contraband and ‘the nature of the case, the
petitioner does not deserve to be released on bail, that too,

when the trial is in progress and would be concluded in near

future, therefore, a chance be given for the conclusion of the

same.

3. I have gone through the entire record carefully
and considered the submissions made by the learned counsel

for the parties.

4. Since except examination of one PW on
27.10.2016, no other progress has been made in the case till
yet and the same is being adjourned since 09.05.2015 on the
part of prosecution by not examining the available prosecution
witnesses rather opted to examine all the witnesses in one go,
which, otherwise, cannot be possible as is evident that except
one, no other witness could be examined due to such like
pretexts and as per available record, twenty-one times, the
case was adjourned due to aforesaid reason while only for two
times the same was adjourned due to absence of the defence
counsel and the fact that the petitioner is languishing behind
the bars since 25.03.2015 would further tilt the scales of
justice in favour of bail rather than jail, therefore, I, at this
stage, does not see any strong reason to withhold the
concession of bail, that too, when the delay in conclusion of
the trial, apparently, is not on his part. Needless to remark that
mere heinousness of crime will not disentitle an accused to the
concession of bail, when ultimate conviction, if any, can repair

the wrong caused by the mistaken relief of bail. Reliance can

well be placed on the judgments of the apex Court rendered in

the cases of Imtiaz Ahamd vs. State (2017 SCMR 1194):
Adnan Prince vs. State (PLD 2017 SC 147).

5. For the reasons discussed above, this petition is
allowed and the petitioner is directed to be released on bail on
furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five
lac) with two sureties, each in the like amount to the
satisfaction of the learned Trial Court, who is to ensure that
the sureties are local, reliable and men of means having
sufficient properties in their names to meet the liability of bail
bonds. The learned Trial Court is directed to take coercive
measures against PWs and to conclude the trial within three
months of this order. The learned Trial Court shall furnish
fortnightly progress report to the Incharge NJPIC of Peshawar

High Court so that it could be placed before Hon’ble The

Chief Justice for his lordship’s perusal. \ | | ( |
