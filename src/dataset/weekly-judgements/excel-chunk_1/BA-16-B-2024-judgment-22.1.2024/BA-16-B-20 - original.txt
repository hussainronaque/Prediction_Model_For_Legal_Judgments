FAZAL_ SUBHAN, J.-_ Through instant petition, the

petitioner namely, Muhammad Junaid Shah son of Roshan
Gul seeks his post arrest in case FIR No.324 dated
06.02.2023 registered under sections 377/376/. .
PPC/43/48/53 Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010 of
police station Banda Daud Shah, District Karak.

2. Record transpires that the complainant Fahad
Thsan initially lodged Naqal Mad No.25 on 28.10.2023 in

respect of firing upon him for criminal intimidation,
preparing naked video for the purpose of blackmailing and
thereafter repeatedly committing sodomy with him, against
the petitioner Muhammad Junaid Shah and after legal
opinion the present case FIR was lodged against him. It was
reported that complainant had friendship with the petitioner
and on 13.02.2023, he took him to nearby mountains and on
gun point, his trouser was removed and his obscene video
was prepared and threatened to upload the video on social
media in case of disclosure to any one and after blackmail
through said video, the petitioner committed forcible
unnatural offence with him for 12/13 times. After uploading
the video, his family member got knowledge of the offence,
whereafter it was secured in USB, hence he lodged the report
of commission of unnatural offence against the petitioner.

3. With this background of the case arguments of
learned counsel for the parties and that of learned AAG for
the State heard and record was tentatively considered.

4. From the available record it is clear that though
there is a delay of about 7/8 months in reporting the matter to
the local police, however, delay in such like matter is
immaterial for the reason that allegedly the petitioner used to
blackmail the complainant for uploading his video on social

medial which forced him to surrender to his demands for
unnatural offences and once he refused to bow down to the
demands of the petitioner, he made the video viral on social
medial and the same was secured through USB. It is also
perceivable that a minor who has faced trauma due to an
immoral act, try not only to conceal but keep silent due to
shame and disgrace in the society, hence delay in lodging the
report in cases pertaining to sodomy or rape could not be
considered a material aspect to dislodge the contention of a
victim, if other materials are available on record to support
the prosecution version. To fortify my above arguments,
reliance can safely be placed on the judgment of “Zahid and
another-Vs-The_ State” reported in (2020 SCMR_590),
wherein plea of delay taken in the petition was discarded and
petition for leave to appeal was dismissed with the following
observations:-

“ Undoubtedly, the FIR was registered after a

day of the crime having been committed,

however, the fact that the modesty of a married

woman was violated by sexual assault makes

understand the apprehension of the victim and

her family in approaching the police

immediately. Delay in reporting the crime to

the police in respect of an offence involving a

person’s honour and reputation and which

society may view unsympathetically could

prey on the minds of a victim and her family
and deter them to go to the police.”
Similarly, in the case of “Muhammad Sajid alias Sajo-Vs-
State and others” reported in (PLJ 2022 Criminal Case 737,
the Hon’ble Lahore High Court, Lahore while discussing the
amendment brought in the Penal Code, 1860 in respect of
insertion of sections 377-A and 377-B have observed that:-

“Let’s now turn to the case in hand. At the

very outset, it is observed that the petitioner is

nominated in the FIR with specific allegations.

It is true that the Complainant approached the

police seven days after the happening but an

adverse inference cannot be drawn against her

on that score at the bail stage because in our

society the people generally do not report such

incident immediately. The overall impact of

the delay, if any, is to be determined by the

Court on the conclusion of the trial when the

testimony of all the witnesses is recorded and

they are duly cross-examined.”
5. The mobile through which video of the
complainant was prepared was recovered on pointation of
petitioner while pistol 30 bore bearing No.91106 with fix
charger having 5 live rounds of the same bore was also
recovered and taken on recovery memo. Record shows that
the petitioner is a young man of 22/23 years while the
complainant is of tender age of 14/15 years, who was
forcibly and on gun point forced for sexual abuse. The

offence is not only one of moral turpitude but a crime against

the society as a whole. Moreso, by putting a minor in state of
fear and anguish would go with him for the whole of his life
and would be a night mare but would also be a cause of
disrespect and dishonor for him to the rest of his life, hence
such offences cannot be let to be treated causally. To protect
child from abuse the Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010
(Act) has been promulgated. Section 377 PPC provides
maximum punishment for life, whereas section 53 of the ibid
Act for “sexual abuse” defined in section 2(y) of the Act, for
10 years imprisonment, hence these offences falls within the
prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.

6. For all the above reasons and the fact that
petitioner is not only directly charged in the FIR but there is
also sufficient material on record to connect him with the
offence charged for, hence the petitioner has failed to make
out a case for grant of bail, resultantly, the instant petition is
dismissed.
