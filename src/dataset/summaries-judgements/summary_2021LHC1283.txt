Note: The judgment sheet does not contain the final judgment or verdict of the court. It only provides the background and facts of the case, as well as the proceedings up to the date of hearing. Here's a summary of the text:

The case involves a murder charge against the appellant and Mst. Zareena Afshan under Sections 302/34 PPC. The prosecution produced 13 witnesses, including eyewitnesses, police officers, and medical experts. The prosecution claimed that the appellant and Mst. Zareena Afshan were involved in the murder, and a 30-bore pistol was recovered from the appellant.

The prosecution's case was based on the statement of Muhammad Shafiq, who was injured in the incident and allegedly made a dying declaration. The eyewitnesses, Muhammad Ibrahim and Muhammad Rafiq, testified against the appellant. The investigating officer, Ghulam Qasim ASI, also testified.

The appellant denied the allegations, claiming that the parents of the deceased had previously demanded his sister Mst. Zareena Afshan's hand in marriage, and when they refused, the parents became angry. The appellant claimed that some unknown persons committed the murder, and that he was falsely implicated due to the earlier quarrel.

The appellant's counsel argued that the eyewitnesses were not credible, as they made material improvements in their statements and were related to each other. The recovery of the pistol was also argued to be inconsequential. The case is under appeal, and the appellant's counsel is challenging the conviction. Here is a summary of the text:

The prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the trial court was not justified in convicting the appellant. The prosecution argues that the conviction was justified because the crime was committed in broad daylight, and two eyewitnesses consistently testified against the appellant. The prosecution also argues that the medical examination and post-mortem report support the eyewitness accounts, and the dying declaration of the victim is reliable. Additionally, the recovery of a pistol from the appellant supports the prosecution's case.

However, the defense argues that the prosecution's case is weak because the eyewitnesses contradicted each other on the number of shots fired, and their testimonies were inconsistent with the FIR. The medical examination and post-mortem report also contradict the eyewitness accounts, and the dying declaration may not be reliable. The text discusses the unreliability of witnesses who intentionally introduce improvements to their statements during trial to cover up inconsistencies or bring their testimony in line with other evidence. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently held that such witnesses are not trustworthy and their testimony should not be relied upon.

In one case, the Court ruled that witnesses who made deliberate improvements to their statements to match medical evidence were not credible. Specifically, the witnesses had not mentioned the type of weapons used in the crime until the trial, and their sudden introduction of this detail was seen as an attempt to bolster the prosecution's case.

Previous judgments have also established that witnesses who make material improvements to their statements during trial are not believable. The Court has emphasized that such improvements are often made to strengthen the prosecution's case and are therefore unreliable.

In the present case, the prosecution's case is weakened by the fact that a key piece of evidence, a rickshaw allegedly present at the crime scene, was not produced during the investigation and its documents were not provided to the investigating officer. This omission has created doubt about the prosecution's story and has significant implications for the case. Here's a summary of the text:

The FIR (First Information Report) was recorded at 1:45 pm, but the incident occurred at 12:30 pm, and the police station was only 1 km away. The complainant, Muhammad Ibrahim, took the injured person, Muhammad Shafiq, to the hospital and then went to the police station to file the FIR. The court notes that it's surprising that no one informed the police about the incident before 1:45 pm.

The court also raises questions about the conduct of Muhammad Ibrahim and Abdul Hameed, as they didn't produce crucial evidence like Muhammad Shafiq's blood-stained clothes. Muhammad Ibrahim made a supplementary statement claiming that Muhammad Shafiq had a quarrel with Taj Muhammad and two women, Mst. Zareen and Mst. Afshan, earlier that day, but this story was disbelieved by the court.

The court found inconsistencies in the testimonies of Muhammad Ibrahim and Muhammad Rafiq, who claimed that Mst. Zareen and Mst. Afshan were two separate women, despite the fact that the investigation revealed they were the same person. The court is critical of the lack of transparency and honesty in the testimonies, which creates an "absolute position" of uncertainty. Here is a summary of the text:

The court is discussing a case where the prosecution's witnesses, Mst. Zareena and Mst. Afshan, made statements that the court believes are false. The court also finds that the prosecution failed to prove a motive for the crime.

The court then moves on to discuss the concept of a "dying declaration", which is a statement made by a person who is dying or believes they are about to die. The court explains that dying declarations are considered reliable because the person making the statement has no reason to lie, and are therefore admissible as evidence in criminal trials.

The court cites examples from English, American, and Canadian jurisdictions to support the idea that dying declarations are universally recognized as a reliable form of evidence. The court quotes the phrase "Nemo moriturus praesumitur mentiri", which means "No one at the point of death is presumed to lie".

The court is implying that the dying declaration in this case may be a crucial piece of evidence, but does not explicitly state whether the declaration is reliable or not. Here's a summary of the text:

In Indian and Pakistani courts, a dying declaration is a statement made by a person who is aware of their impending death and is considered a relevant piece of evidence in homicide cases. However, it's not an absolute rule and the courts must evaluate its sanctity with great care and caution, considering factors such as:

* Whether the maker had the physical capacity to make the declaration
* Whether they had the opportunity to identify the assailant
* Whether there was a chance of misidentification
* Whether the declaration was free from outside influence
* Whether the witness heard the deceased correctly

In the discussed case, the prosecution presented a dying declaration as evidence, but it was deemed unreliable due to several reasons, including:

* The declaration was recorded in the presence of others, including the complainant and other witnesses, which could have influenced the deceased's statement.
* The investigating officer failed to obtain the lady doctor's signatures and certificate, as required, to authenticate the declaration.

The court ultimately discarded the evidence of the dying declaration due to these inconsistencies and irregularities. The text discusses a court case involving a dying declaration, which is a statement made by a person who is dying or believes they are about to die, usually in relation to the circumstances of their impending death. The court rules that the dying declaration in this case is not reliable and should not be considered as evidence. The reasons for this are:

1. The statement was not recorded by a medical professional or in the presence of a doctor, which is unusual and raises doubts about its authenticity.
2. The statement is factually incorrect in several respects, including the number of gunshots the deceased received and the identity of a person mentioned in the statement.
3. The recovery of a pistol from the appellant is inconsequential as there was no evidence of an empty shell casing at the crime scene.

The court emphasizes the importance of careful scrutiny of evidence and the need to weigh the credibility and reliability of evidence presented in a case. The judge quotes Jeremy Bentham's definition of evidence as "any matter of fact, the effect, tendency or design of which is to produce in the mind, a persuasion, affirmative or dis-affirmative, of the existence of some other matter of fact." The court's motto is "Fiat Justitia," or "Let Justice be done." Here is a summary of the document:

The document is a court judgment that criticizes a previous judgment (impugned judgment) in a criminal case. The appellant, Taj Muhammad, was convicted of murder by the trial court, but the appellate court finds the judgment to be flawed and sets it aside. The appellate court rules that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the trial court's findings were contradictory, imaginary, and based on presumptions rather than evidence. The appellate court notes that the burden of proof in a criminal case lies with the prosecution, and if there is any doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. The court cites a previous Supreme Court of Pakistan judgment that holds that if there is a single circumstance that raises doubt about the prosecution's case, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused. The appellate court finds that the trial court's judgment did not meet the required standard and was based on external considerations rather than a critical analysis of the facts. Therefore, the appellate court allows the appeal, sets aside the impugned judgment, and acquits the appellant.
