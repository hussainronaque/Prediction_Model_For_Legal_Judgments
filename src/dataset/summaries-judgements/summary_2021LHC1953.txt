Here is a summary of the case:

The appellants, Muhammad Mukhtiar and another, were arrested on May 24, 2017, for allegedly running a factory that produced misbranded and adulterated cold drinks, including Coca Cola, Sprite, and Mirinda. The raid was conducted by Food Inspector Rana Muhammad Saleem, who had made a bargain with Muhammad Mukhtiar to purchase the drinks. The recovered material, including caps, labels, citric acid, and packs of the drinks, was made into sealed parcels after separation of samples.

The prosecution produced four witnesses, including Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, Rana Muhammad Saleem, Muhammad Ilyas S.I, and Muhammad Asghar Constable. The appellants pleaded not guilty and demanded a trial.

The appeal raises serious questions about the sealing, sampling, and safe custody of the evidence. The court notes that the methods of taking samples are provided under Section 20 of the Punjab Pure Food Ordinance (PPFO), which requires the samples to be divided into three parts, marked, sealed, and fastened. The appellants argue that the raid was conducted by Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, who is a Health Officer, but not a designated Food Inspector under the PPFO.

The court is considering the appeal and has noted that there are issues with the way the evidence was handled, including the sealing and sampling of the evidence. Here's a summary:

A court case involves the conviction of appellants for keeping adulterated/misbranded drinks. The prosecution's case relies on reports from the Government Public Analyst Punjab Food Authority Multan. However, the defense argues that the prosecution failed to establish a "chain of safe custody" for the samples, which is essential to ensure the authenticity of the analyst's report.

The prosecution claims that Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, the District Officer (Health), conducted a raid and collected samples in his capacity as an ex-officio Inspector. However, the defense argues that there is no evidence to show that the samples were properly prepared, sealed, and transmitted to the government analyst, or that they were kept in safe custody during the intervening period.

The witnesses, including Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, Rana Muhammad Saleem (Food Inspector), and Muhammad Ilyas S.I, did not provide any information about the preparation of sample parcels or who deposited them with the government analyst. The court notes that establishing a chain of safe custody is crucial in such cases to ensure the integrity of the evidence and prevent doubts about the authenticity of the analyst's report. Here is a summary of the text:

The Punjab Pure Food Rules, 2011 require a specific procedure for sending food samples to an expert for analysis, including sending a sealed container with a letter in Form 5 and a clear impression of the seal used. However, in a criminal case, the prosecution failed to follow this procedure and did not produce Form 5 or evidence of a specific seal on the parcels sent to the Government Analyst.

The court notes inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, including Dr. Zeeshan Rauf, Food Inspector Rana Muhammad Saleem, Muhammad Ilyas SI, and Muhammad Asghar Constable, about who sent the parcels to the Government Analyst.

The court cites previous cases, including Abdul Majeed vs. The State and Nasrullah alias Nasro vs. The State, to emphasize that the prosecution has the burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt and that any doubts or infirmities in the prosecution's case must be resolved in favor of the accused.

Ultimately, the court allows the criminal appeal, sets aside the impugned judgment, and acquits the appellants of the charges.
