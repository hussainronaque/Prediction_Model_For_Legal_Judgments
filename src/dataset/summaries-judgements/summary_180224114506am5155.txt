Here's a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case Details**

* Case Number: Cr.A No. 72-M/2017
* Appellant: Fazal Jameel (now deceased) through his father, Sather Abdul Khalig
* Respondents: The State and Aftab Alam
* Hearing Date: 15.02.2018
* Judge: Mr. Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim

**Background**

* Fazal Jameel (complainant) executed a sale deed with Aftab Alam (respondent) and received a cheque from him, which was dishonored by the bank.
* A case was registered against Aftab Alam under Sections 489-F/420 P.P.C.
* The parties reached a compromise, and Aman Khan stood surety for Aftab Alam, issuing a cheque of Rs.500,000/- to Fazal Jameel, which was also dishonored.
* A new case was registered against Aman Khan, who was later acquitted based on a compromise with Fazal Jameel.
* Aftab Alam was also acquitted based on the original compromise.

**Appeal**

* Fazal Jameel's father (appellant) is challenging Aftab Alam's acquittal, arguing that:
	+ The compromise with Aman Khan was not fulfilled, as no payment was made to Fazal Jameel.
	+ The compromise with Aftab Alam was only for the purpose of securing bail, and therefore, his acquittal is illegal.

The appeal is still pending, with partial arguments having been heard. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellant (the father of the complainant) is appealing the acquittal of the accused respondent by the trial court. The trial court acquitted the accused based on a compromise between the parties, but the appellant argues that this was illegal because the court did not allow him to present evidence. The accused respondent submitted that there was a valid compromise between the parties, which included a payment of Rs. 500,000 to the complainant, and that the trial court was correct in acquitting him.

The key question is whether a compromise reached at the bail stage can be considered for acquittal during the trial. The court notes that Section 345(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that certain offences, including the one under Section 489-F of the Pakistan Penal Code, can be compounded by the parties without court intervention. In such cases, the compromise takes effect immediately and the court is bound to pass an order in accordance with the terms of the compromise.

The court cites a Supreme Court precedent (Tarig Mehmood vs. Naseer Ahmad and others) to support the view that once a compromise is reached, the parties are bound by it and cannot resile from it at a later stage. Since the complainant had reached a compromise with the accused respondent on April 2, 2016, and the offence falls under Section 345(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court holds that the parties are bound by that compromise. Here is a summary of the judgment:

The appellant challenged the acquittal of the accused, Aftab Alam, in a case involving Section 489-F of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 420 PPC. The accused was acquitted by the trial court based on a compromise between the parties at the initial stage of the case. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that such compromises are legal under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

The court found that the case mainly involved Section 489-F PPC and not Section 420 PPC, which cannot be compounded without court intervention. The police had incorrectly added Section 420 PPC to the charges. The court also found that the complainant had previously compromised with another accused, Aman Khan, and received Rs. 500,000, which was the subject of the dispute. The court concluded that the controversy between the parties had been resolved, and further proceedings would be futile.

Therefore, the appeal was dismissed, and the acquittal of the accused was upheld.
