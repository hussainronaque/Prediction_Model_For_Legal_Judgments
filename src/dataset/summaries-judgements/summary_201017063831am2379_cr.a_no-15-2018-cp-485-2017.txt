Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has allowed an appeal against a judgment of the Peshawar High Court, which had upheld the decision of the Accountability Court to freeze the bank accounts of two petitioners, Muhammad Israr Khan and Muhammad Javed Khari.

The petitioners had challenged the order, arguing that there were no specific allegations against them and that the excess payment made to them was not quantified. The High Court had maintained the order of the Accountability Court, which had confirmed the decision of the DG NAB (National Accountability Bureau) to freeze the accounts.

The Supreme Court, comprising three judges, heard the petition and found that the orders impugned were "shorn of reasons" and did not specify the allegations against the petitioners. The court set aside the impugned judgment and orders and sent the case back to the competent authority to pass an appropriate order in terms of Section 24-A of the General Clauses Act, after hearing the petitioners.

In essence, the Supreme Court has quashed the decision to freeze the bank accounts of the two petitioners and directed the authorities to re-examine the case and pass a fresh order after providing the petitioners with a hearing. It appears to be a certification statement from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad. Here's a breakdown:

* "Maqbool Baqar" and "J. Sd/-Bjaz ul Ahsan" are likely the names of two individuals, possibly judges or court officials.
* "J" is an abbreviation for "Justice".
* "Certified to be True Copy" indicates that the document is a verified and accurate copy of an original document.
* "Court Associate" suggests that the statement is made by an assistant or clerk of the court.
* "Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad" is the highest court in Pakistan, and the certification is being made on behalf of that court.

In summary, the statement is attesting that the attached document is a true and accurate copy, certified by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
