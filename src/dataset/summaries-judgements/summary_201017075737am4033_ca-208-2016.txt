Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has issued a letter to the Registrar of the Peshawar High Court regarding a criminal appeal case (Crl.A.208/2016). The case involves Zakirullah, who was convicted of transporting 62 kilograms of charas (a type of cannabis) in a tractor-trolley and was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined. The appeal was filed against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated 17/11/2015.

The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and has directed the Peshawar High Court to take further necessary action. The Registrar of the Supreme Court is returning the original record of the High Court received earlier.

The judgment of the Supreme Court, dated 22/02/2018, notes that the Moharrir (a police officer responsible for safe custody of evidence) of the relevant police station was not produced as a prosecution witness nor was his statement recorded, which is a significant omission. The court has reappraised the evidence and has allowed the appeal. Here is a summary of the text:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan is ruling on a criminal appeal (No. 208 of 2016) and has found that the prosecution failed to establish the safe custody and transmission of recovered substance samples. The samples were taken by Ihsan Ullah, F.C., but he was not produced as a witness, and his statement was not recorded. Furthermore, his name was not mentioned in the Chemical Examiner's report. The court cites two previous cases (Amjad Ali v. The State and Ikramullah and others v. The State) that held that without establishing safe custody and transmission of evidence, the prosecution cannot establish its case against an accused. Therefore, the court allows the appeal, sets aside the conviction and sentence, and acquits the appellant, extending the benefit of doubt to him. He is to be released from jail forthwith if not required for other reasons.
