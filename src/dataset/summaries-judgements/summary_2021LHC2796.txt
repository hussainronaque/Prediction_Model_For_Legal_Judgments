The document appears to be a legal appeal (Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010) related to a corruption case. The accused, a former Deputy Director Finance at NIH, is alleged to have accumulated assets worth Rs. 2,25,59,276/- between August 1994 and February 2001, which is disproportionate to his legitimate income.

The assets in question include multiple bank accounts in Pakistani Rupees and US Dollars, opened in 1996 or 1997, with net credit entries of Rs. 9.937 million and US$ 3,15,542/- respectively. The accused is also alleged to have received a payment of US$ 10,000/- from a contractor/supplier of NIH without consideration.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) alleges that the accused committed an offence of corruption and corrupt practices under Section 9 of the Ordinance and is liable to be punished.

The accused was previously declared a Proclaimed Offender and was convicted under Section 31-A of the Ordinance, but his appeal was allowed, and the case was remanded to the trial court. The trial court framed a charge against the accused under Section 10 read with 31-A of the Ordinance, to which the accused pleaded not guilty and demanded a trial. Here is a summary of the witnesses produced in the case:

**Defense Witnesses (DW)**

1. Muhammad Ayyub - Brother-in-law of appellant, claimed to have sent money to appellant from abroad.
2. Muhammad Magqsood - Brother-in-law of appellant.
3. Appellant himself (Dw-3) claimed that assets were not beyond his means and were from his own income and amounts received from his brothers-in-law settled abroad. Here is a summary of the arguments made by the appellant and the respondent in the criminal appeal:

**Appellant's arguments:**

* The appellant claims to have a joint family business of property with his brothers-in-law, who were working in Saudi Arabia and sending money to him for the business.
* The appellant had a legitimate source of income from his job as Deputy Director Finance in NIH and from part-time business activities.
* The accounts shown as evidence by the prosecution are either in the appellant's name or joint with his wife, and the appellant had no concern with the remaining accounts.
* The prosecution failed to provide a complete picture of the accounts, and the credits shown were small and negligible, with some amounts counted multiple times.
* The prosecution did not prove the factum of misuse of authority or corruption, which is required to constitute an offence.
* The appellant's possession of pecuniary resources and properties does not constitute an offence in itself.
* The investigation was dishonest, and the investigating officer failed to explore all legitimate sources of income.

**Respondent's (NAB) arguments:**

* In a case where a public servant is accused of living beyond their means, the prosecution only needs to prove the existence of assets, and then the burden shifts to the accused to provide a satisfactory explanation.
* The bank accounts produced by the prosecution show abnormal transactions, and the appellant failed to provide a plausible explanation.
* The wife and mother-in-law of the appellant had no independent source of income, and the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof.

In essence, the appellant is arguing that the prosecution has not proven any corruption or misuse of authority and that the assets and bank accounts can be explained by legitimate sources of income, including the joint family business and remittances from brothers-in-law abroad. The respondent (NAB) is arguing that the prosecution has shown that the appellant has assets and bank transactions that cannot be explained by his legitimate income, and that the burden is now on the appellant to provide a satisfactory explanation. The summary is as follows:

The appellant's conviction by the learned Trial Court is being challenged. The prosecution argues that the appellant has not provided a sufficient explanation for the acquisition of certain properties, and that his conduct, including absconding abroad, supports the prosecution's case. The appellant's lawyers counter that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, and that the appellant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.

The court cites two previous cases, Pir Mazhar ul Haq vs. The State and Khan Asfandyar Wali vs. Federation of Pakistan, which establish that the prosecution must present positive and affirmative evidence to prove the accused's guilt, and that the accused is only required to offer a reasonable explanation to be given the benefit of the doubt.

The court also provides guidance on the interpretation of Section 14(C) of the NAB Ordinance, stating that the prosecution must first make a reasonable case against the accused, and if successful, the burden of proof shifts to the accused to disprove the presumption of guilt. The text discusses a criminal appeal (Criminal Appeal No.1809-E of 2010) in which the appellant was convicted under various sections of the Ordinance, including Section 9(a)(v) and Section 31-A, related to absconding to avoid service of warrants. The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of Inspector Abdul Majeed (Pw-17) who claimed to have made efforts to execute non-bailable warrants of arrest. However, the appeal court notes that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the warrants were issued, executed, and that the appellant was declared a Proclaimed Offender. The court holds that the prosecution did not prove the appellant's absconding, and at most, it was a long disappearance, which was not unlawful as the appellant was abroad on approved leave.

Regarding the conviction under Section 9(a)(v), the court notes that the only property forfeited was House No. 53, G-11/2 Islamabad, but the prosecution's original case alleged that the appellant had purchased plots in the name of his brother-in-law, which was later disbelieved by the trial court. The appeal court supports its observation with the fact that the NAB later imposed a caution on one of the plots, but the High Court ultimately accepted a writ petition filed by the appellant's mother-in-law, holding that the appellant had no connection to the property.

In essence, the appeal court is questioning the prosecution's case and the trial court's conviction, particularly regarding the appellant's absconding and the properties allegedly purchased through corrupt means. Here is a summary of the text:

The prosecution's case against the appellant is weak and unsuccessful in establishing many of the allegations made. The judgment of the trial court, which was not appealed by NAB, has become final and cannot be challenged now. The prosecution's failure to challenge the judgment is a significant obstacle to their case. The court notes that the appellant's house, Plot/House No. 53, G-11/2 Islamabad, was not forfeited to the state and the appellant, as the owner, has the right to deal with it as desired.

The prosecution's case is limited to the allegation that the appellant's house was beyond his known sources of income. However, the court observes that the prosecution cannot now ask to examine the bank accounts of the appellant's brother-in-laws and mother-in-law.

The court highlights the importance of a credible and reliable investigation, which is lacking in this case. The prosecution's witnesses, including the investigating officer, have weaknesses in their testimonies, and the prosecution has failed to provide adequate evidence to support their allegations. The court notes that the appellant had declared his assets, including the house in question, in his assets declaration, and that he had purchased the house with the approval of the competent authority. Here is a summary of the court's decision:

The appeal court has overturned the trial court's judgment, acquitting the appellant of the charges against him. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, citing several reasons:

* The prosecution did not produce the investigating officer, Niaz Ahmad, as a witness, which is a material witness in the case.
* The prosecution did not provide sufficient secondary evidence to prove the investigation conducted by Niaz Ahmad.
* The appellant's version of events, including his claim that his brothers-in-law sent him money from abroad, was not adequately disproven by the prosecution.
* The court held that the appellant was under an obligation to offer a reasonable explanation for his actions, but not to prove his innocence beyond doubt.

The court ultimately ruled in favor of the appellant, setting aside the trial court's judgment and acquitting him of the charges. The appellant is no longer required to comply with the terms of his bail and is free to go.
