The judgment sheet does not provide the outcome of the appeal and revision petitions, but rather sets out the background and facts of the case. Here is a summary of the case:

* A man named Asif Mehmood was found dead in Nala Umarwala near Chasma Barrage with a rope around his neck and no shirt on his body.
* The complainant, likely a family member, identified the body and took it to the hospital.
* Initially, the FIR was lodged against an unknown accused, but later, based on witness statements, the appellant (whose name is not mentioned) was implicated in the case, along with four co-accused (who were later acquitted).
* The prosecution introduced eyewitnesses Raza Muhammad and Dost Muhammad, who claimed to have seen the appellant with the deceased on the day of the murder.
* The appellant was arrested, charged, and claimed trial. The prosecution produced 22 witnesses and documentary evidence, while the appellant professed innocence but did not produce any defense evidence.
* The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him accordingly.
* The appellant's lawyer is now appealing the conviction, arguing that the eyewitnesses' statements are not trustworthy because they did not come forward for 8 days after the incident and 4 days after the funeral. The lawyer also argues that the prosecution's case relies on weak circumstantial evidence and that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant based on the evidence of one witness, Ghulam Hassan, who did not actually see the appellant with the deceased. This is alegal document related to a criminal appeal (Crl. Appeal No.1036/2013) and a criminal revision (Crl. Revision No.724/2013). The appellant, Waheed Khan, has been convicted of a crime and is appealing his conviction. The prosecution is arguing that the conviction should be upheld, while the defense is arguing that the conviction should be overturned.

The main arguments of the defense are:

* The prosecution failed to recover the "Dala" (carry van) from the appellant or his co-accused.
* No motive was proved against the appellant.
* The recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the appellant's possession is inconsequential because there was no allegation of theft of cash.
* There is no evidence of extrajudicial confession or "Wajtaker" (a type of witness) against the appellant or his co-accused.
* The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a shadow of doubt.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argues that:

* The prosecution has proved its case beyond a shadow of doubt through reliable and trustworthy circumstantial evidence and eye-witness testimony.
* The appellant was identified by two eye-witnesses, Raza Muhammad and Dost Muhammad, during an identification parade.
* The motive of snatching the vehicle of the deceased and selling it was proved through the statements of several prosecution witnesses.
* The recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the appellant's possession was sale proceeds of the snatched vehicle.
* The appellant failed to establish any malice against the prosecution witnesses.

The court has heard arguments from both sides and will render a decision based on the evidence presented. Here's a summary of the text:

Two prosecution witnesses, Raza Muhammad and Dost Muhammad, claimed to have seen a crime being committed on October 5, 2010, at around 8:30 PM. They stated that they saw three unknown individuals beating a person on the eastern bank of the Umarwala canal, and then throwing the person's body into the canal. The witnesses alleged that they did not intervene because they were threatened by the perpetrators, who escaped on a motorized cart (Shahzor "Dala'"). The witnesses later identified the appellant and co-accused during an identification parade on October 28, 2010.

However, there are some inconsistencies in the witnesses' statements. Raza Muhammad claimed to have seen the incident, but did not identify the victim, Asif Mehmood, as his nephew and son-in-law until later. Additionally, both witnesses delayed reporting the incident to the police, waiting eight days to make their statements. They also attended Asif Mehmood's funeral on October 9, 2010, but did not come forward with their testimony until four days later. Their statements have raised questions about their credibility and the reliability of their eyewitness accounts. Here is a summary of the text:

The writer is questioning the credibility of eyewitnesses in a criminal case. The eyewitnesses made statements to the police 8 days after the incident and 4 days after attending the funeral of the deceased. The writer argues that this delay raises doubts about the truthfulness of their evidence. The writer also questions the reliability of an identification parade held 15 days after the incident, as the appellant was already nominated in the case by then. The writer references various court judgments to support their arguments.

Additionally, the writer is skeptical about the circumstantial evidence presented in the case, citing that every circumstance should be linked together to form a continuous chain of evidence. If any link is missing, the benefit should go to the accused. The writer references more court judgments to support this argument.

Overall, the writer is arguing that the evidence presented in the case is not reliable and should not be trusted. Here's a summary of the text:

In a criminal case, the prosecution relies on circumstantial evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has established that in such cases, the circumstantial evidence must form a continuous chain that links the accused to the crime, excluding all other hypotheses of innocence. This means that every piece of evidence must be interconnected and cannot be explained away by any other hypothesis.

The prosecution's case is based on four pieces of circumstantial evidence:

1. Last seen evidence: testified by Muhammad Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5), who claimed to have seen the deceased with the appellant and his co-accused at Kundian Filling Station on 05.10.2010.
2. Motive and recovery of Rs.21,500/- from the appellant.
3. Recovery of pistol.
4. Medical evidence.

The last seen evidence is suspicious, as the witnesses gave contradictory statements about the timing of their visit to the complainant's house and their subsequent statements to the police. The witness Muhammad Imran (PW.4) initially stated that he reached the complainant's house at 11:00 P.M. on 11.10.2010, but later claimed it was 5:30 A.M. on the same day. The witnesses also admitted to discussing the facts of the occurrence with each other after reaching the complainant's house.

The court will examine each piece of circumstantial evidence separately to determine whether they form a continuous chain of evidence that links the accused to the crime, as required by the Supreme Court's judgments. Here's a summary of the text:

The text discusses the testimony of two prosecution witnesses, Muhammad Imran (PW.4) and Muhammad Nawaz (PW.5), in a criminal case. They claimed to have last seen the deceased, Asif Mehmood, with the appellant and his co-accused on October 5, 2010. However, there are inconsistencies in their testimonies. They reached the complainant's house on October 11, 2010, at 5:30 am and remained there for the night, discussing the incident with the complainant. They only made their statements to the police on October 12, 2010, despite the police station being only 2/3 km away from the complainant's house. The delay in making their statements and the opportunity for collaboration and concoction raise serious doubts about the truthfulness of their evidence. As a result, the prosecution's last seen evidence is deemed untrustworthy and was rightly disbelieved by the trial court. Here's a summary:

The appeal is discussing the evidence presented by the prosecution in a murder case involving the appellant, Waheed Khan. The prosecution's case relies on the testimony of Ghulam Hassan, who stopped a vehicle (Shahzor "Dala") at a check post on October 5, 2010, and allowed the appellant and his co-accused to proceed after checking their ID cards. However, Ghulam Hassan did not identify the driver of the vehicle, and the vehicle was never recovered from the appellant or his co-accused.

The prosecution also presented evidence of motive, alleging that the appellant and his co-accused committed the murder to snatch the vehicle and sell it. However, this evidence is based on the testimony of two witnesses, Pervaiz Iqbal and Nematullah, who claimed to have seen the co-accused selling the vehicle to Khan Ameer Khan. However, Pervaiz Iqbal's testimony is questionable, as he only reported the incident to the police on October 14, 2010, five days after the murder, and his statement contains inconsistencies.

Overall, the appeal argues that the prosecution's evidence is unreliable and insufficient to prove the appellant's guilt. The text appears to be a legal document discussing a criminal case. Here's a summary:

The prosecution's case is being questioned because of inconsistencies and lack of evidence. Two witnesses, Pervaiz Iqbal (PW.17) and Nematullah (PW.22), claimed to have received information about the murder of Asif Mehmood on different dates. Pervaiz Iqbal claimed to have received the information on October 9, 2010, and even used his "Baithak" for the funeral ceremony, but didn't make a statement to the police until October 14, 2010. Nematullah, who was a conductor for Pervaiz Iqbal, claimed to have received the information on October 14, 2010, which is unlikely given Pervaiz Iqbal's earlier knowledge of the event.

The prosecution also claims that the appellant (the accused) was in possession of Rs.21,500, which was allegedly the sale proceeds of a vehicle (Shahzor "Dala" SGS-1333) sold by the appellant and co-accused to Khan Ameer Khan. However, the evidence presented by the prosecution is deemed unreliable due to the discrepancies in the witnesses' statements. Additionally, the vehicle in question was not recovered, and there is no documentary proof of the sale or purchase of the vehicle. The prosecution's claim that Khan Ameer Khan would purchase a vehicle without documentation is also unbelievable.

Overall, the prosecution's case is being challenged due to the lack of credible evidence and inconsistencies in the witnesses' statements. Here is a summary of the court's decision:

The court has acquitted the appellant, Waheed Khan, of all charges due to lack of evidence proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution's motive for the crime was not proven, and the recovery of a pistol from the appellant's possession was deemed inconsequential since it was not used in the crime. The medical evidence presented by the prosecution only supported the fact that the victim died from strangulation, but did not identify the assailant. The court considered all aspects of the case and came to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to prove its case. As a result, the appellant's conviction and sentence were set aside, and he was acquitted of all charges.
