**Judgment**

* The judgment of November 28, 2014, convicted Syed Saqlain Shah and sentenced him to life imprisonment, while acquitting Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, Syed Raza Shah, and Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila.
* The present appeal and revision petitions were filed against the judgment. Here is a summary of the text:

A man named Kamran Haider was shot and killed by multiple people who fired their pistols at him indiscriminately. The accused individuals, including the appellant, were motivated by a grudge against Kamran Haider's family, who had rejected a marriage proposal from one of the accused's family members. The appellant was arrested, and the prosecution presented 10 witnesses, including two court witnesses and documentary evidence, to try to prove the case. The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him.

The appellant's lawyer is now appealing the conviction, arguing that the appellant is innocent and that the prosecution's eyewitnesses are not credible because they lived far from the crime scene and couldn't justify their presence at the time of the crime. The lawyer also argues that there was a delay in conducting the post-mortem examination of the victim, which raises doubts about the witnesses' testimony. Additionally, the lawyer claims that the motive behind the crime was not proven and that the recovery of the weapon and forensic evidence is not reliable. Here is a summary of the text:

A criminal appeal (Crl. Appeal No.2227 of 2014) and a criminal revision petition (Cri. Revision No.24 of 2015) are being argued in a case involving the murder of Kamran Haider. The appellant, Syed Saqlain Shah, is accused of firing at the deceased along with a co-accused, Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar. The prosecution argues that it has proved its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, citing eyewitness testimony, medical evidence, and the recovery of a pistol from the appellant's possession. The defense argues that the prosecution's evidence is not credible, citing the acquittal of the co-accused and the lack of independent corroboration. The court is now considering the arguments and reviewing the record to determine whether the conviction and sentence of the appellant should be upheld or set aside. Additionally, the complainant is seeking enhancement of the sentence of the appellant to the death penalty. Here is a summary of the text:

The text describes the testimonies of two eyewitnesses, Imran Haider (PW.7) and Durrab Hussain (PW.8), in a criminal case. Both eyewitnesses claim to have witnessed the crime at G.T. Road Kala Shah Kaku, but they are not residents of the area.

Imran Haider testifies that he followed his brother, Kamran Haider (deceased), to the spot because he suspected something was wrong after his brother received a phone call from Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, a co-accused. However, no phone number of Laila or Kamran Haider is mentioned in the FIR or in any prosecution witness statement.

Durrab Hussain claims he was at the spot to get petrol for his motorcycle, but admits during cross-examination that there are other petrol pumps near his house, and he doesn't provide a valid reason for traveling 15-20 kilometers to get petrol.

The text suggests that both eyewitnesses have questionable motives and their testimonies are not credible, as they lack important details and seem to be making excuses for their presence at the scene of the crime. The text is a legal document discussing the credibility of two eyewitnesses, Durrab Hussain (PW.8) and Ahmad Subhani, in a criminal case. The witnesses claimed to have been present at the scene of a crime and provided statements to the police. However, during cross-examination, Durrab Hussain made an inconsistent statement, implying that he went to the scene to see a plot in a housing scheme, which was not mentioned in his previous statements.

The document argues that the witnesses' presence at the scene is questionable, as there are multiple petrol pumps near their homes, making it unlikely that they would travel 15 km to another town just to get petrol. Their reasons for being at the scene are not convincing, and they are considered "chance witnesses" whose testimony is not reliable unless they can provide a justifiable reason for their presence.

The document cites two Supreme Court of Pakistan cases, "Mst. Sughra Begum and another Vs. Qaiser Pervez and others" (2015) and "Sufvan Nawaz and another Vs. The State and others" (2020), which established that chance witnesses' testimony is suspect and requires convincing explanations to be accepted. The document concludes that the eyewitnesses' evidence is not free from doubt and should be treated with skepticism. The text discusses a court case where the prosecution's eyewitnesses are considered "chance witnesses" whose presence at the scene of the crime is questionable. The court cites previous judgments that have held that chance witnesses' testimony is not reliable unless their presence at the scene is established through independent evidence. In this case, the eyewitnesses' presence at the scene is doubted because of a delay in conducting the post-mortem examination of the deceased, which suggests that the witnesses may not have been present at the time of the occurrence. The court also notes that the motive behind the crime, as alleged by the prosecution, is unclear. The judge concludes that the prosecution's eyewitnesses were not present at the scene of the crime and that the delay in the post-mortem examination was likely used to procure fake eyewitnesses. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellant was accused of murdering Kamran Haider due to a rejected marriage proposal, but the prosecution's case is weakened by several factors:

1. The complainant conceded that the deceased was already married, and the co-accused, Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila, was also married prior to the occurrence.
2. The FIR did not specify the date, time, month, and year of the alleged marriage offer, and no family elder was produced during the investigation to corroborate the claim.
3. Mst. Umm-i-Naila alias Laila was acquitted by the trial court, and the appeal against her acquittal was dismissed due to non-prosecution.
4. No motive was alleged against the appellant, and the prosecution failed to prove any motive.
5. The recovery of a pistol from the appellant and the positive report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, are questionable because the empties and pistol were deposited together at the police station, raising the possibility that fake empties were prepared from the pistol and sent for comparison.

Overall, the prosecution's case is flawed, and the trial court's decision to acquit the appellant was correct. The text summarizes a court case in Pakistan where the appellant, Syed Saqlain Shah, was convicted and sentenced for making fire shots at the deceased, Kamran Haider. The conviction was based on prosecution evidence, including the recovery of a pistol and positive report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency. However, the court notes several flaws in the prosecution's case:

1. The recovery of the pistol and forensic report were disbelieved in previous cases due to doubts about the handling of evidence.
2. A key witness, Shahzada Qeqous, who deposited the empties and pistol at the forensic agency, was not produced in court by the prosecution.
3. The co-accused, Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, was acquitted, but the same prosecution evidence was used to convict the appellant.
4. The court notes that if the evidence is disbelieved for one accused, it cannot be believed for another without independent corroboration, which is lacking in this case.
5. The police opinion on the innocence or guilt of an accused is irrelevant and inadmissible in evidence.

The court concludes that the conviction of the appellant is unwarranted due to the flaws in the prosecution's case and the lack of independent corroboration. The text appears to be a judicial ruling or judgment in a criminal case. The main points can be summarized as follows:

1. The court emphasizes that the determination of guilt or innocence is the exclusive domain of the courts, and not of the police or any other entity.
2. The court rejects the idea that the opinion of an investigating officer can be used to determine guilt or innocence, as this could lead to arbitrary and unjust results.
3. The court notes that the prosecution's case against the appellant is not distinguishable from that of a co-accused, Muhammad Saleem alias Kali Gujjar, who was acquitted earlier.
4. The court disbelieves the recovery of a weapon of offence from the appellant, as well as the alleged motive behind the crime, due to lack of independent corroboration.
5. The court cites several precedents from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which have held that evidence that is disbelieved in one case cannot be relied upon to convict another accused without independent corroboration.
6. The court concludes that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore accepts the appeal and acquits the appellant. Here is a summary:

The court has:

* Overturned the conviction and sentence of Syed Saqlain Shah, ordering his acquittal on a charge of murder (Section 302(b) PPC) due to reasonable doubt.
* Ordered Syed Saqlain Shah's release from custody, unless he is required in another case.
* Dismissed a criminal revision filed by Imran Haider (complainant) seeking to increase Syed Saqlain Shah's sentence from life imprisonment to death, as the conviction has been set aside.
