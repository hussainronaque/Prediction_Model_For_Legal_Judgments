**Appeal:** Shahbaz appealed against his conviction and sentence, which was heard by the Lahore High Court.

**Prosecution Story:** The prosecution's case was based on the FIR lodged by Noor Muhammad, the complainant, who stated that on July 14, 2011, he, his daughter Ghulam Bibi, and others were attacked by the four accused, including Shahbaz, who fired shots at them, resulting in the death of Ghulam Bibi and injuries to Faheem.

**Disposal:** The Lahore High Court disposed of the appeal and the murder reference through a consolidated judgment, dated January 16, 2019. Here's a summary of the case:

A murder case was filed against several accused persons, including Shahbaz, for the murder of Mst. Ghulam Bibi and the injuries caused to Faheem Ahmad. The motive behind the crime was a grudge against the complainant's grandson, Mobashar, who had contracted a love marriage with Mst. Tahira Bibi, the daughter of one of the accused, Hayyat.

On the day of the incident, the accused persons, including Faheem and Jahangir, threatened the complainant and his companions, saying that anyone who stepped forward would face dire consequences. When the complainant and his companions raised a hue and cry, people from nearby houses came out, and the accused persons fled the scene, brandishing their weapons.

The complainant and his companions took the injured persons to the Civil Hospital, where Mst. Ghulam Bibi succumbed to her injuries. The police investigation was conducted, and several pieces of evidence, including blood-stained clothes and a pistol, were recovered.

The prosecution presented 13 witnesses, including the complainant and the injured Faheem Ahmad, who testified against the accused persons. The trial court formally charged the appellant, Shahbaz, who pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Here is a summary of the case:

**Murder Reference No.190/2015 Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015**

The case involves the murder of Mst. Ghulam Bibi and injuries to Faheem. The prosecution presented several witnesses, including:

* PW-6, who prepared the FIR
* PW-5, who prepared a scaled site plan of the crime scene
* PW-7, who escorted the dead body to the mortuary
* PW-9, who got Faheem medically examined
* PW-10 and PW-13, who investigated the case
* PW-3, Dr. Shagufta Zahoor, who conducted the postmortem examination of the deceased and found several lacerated wounds on her body, including injuries to her chest, arm, and abdomen. The doctor opined that the cause of death was shock due to internal and external bleeding.

The prosecution also presented medical evidence of Faheem's injuries, which included a lacerated wound on his left thigh.

The appellant (the accused) denied the allegations against him and claimed that he was present in a shop when Ghulam Bibi and an unknown person attacked him. He claimed to have fired a shot in the air, which hit the roof of the shop, and then an unknown person snatched his pistol and fired at him, hitting Ghulam Bibi inadvertently. The appellant did not present any defense evidence.

The court is now considering the appeal of the appellant, who was convicted of murder and other charges. Here is a summary of the court case:

**Case Details**

* Case Number: Crl. Appeal No.1010-J/2015
* Appellant: Mst. Ghulam Bibi's family member (name not specified)
* Crime: Murder of Mst. Ghulam Bibi
* Lower Court Verdict: Conviction of the appellant
* Appeal: Against the conviction

**Arguments**

* Appellant's Counsel: The lower court judgment is flawed and did not consider the facts of the case. The prosecution's story is unbelievable, and the medical evidence does not support the prosecution's version. The appellant was present at a shop where the deceased and another person, Faheem, attacked him, and he exercised his right of self-defense.
* Prosecution's Counsel: The FIR was lodged promptly, and the appellant was named with a specific role in inflicting injuries on the deceased. The two prosecution witnesses, including Faheem, who was injured during the incident, supported the prosecution's case. The medical evidence also supports the prosecution's version, and the appellant was found to be guilty during the investigation.

**Key Points**

* The deceased, Mst. Ghulam Bibi, was taken to the hospital for first aid but died.
* The complainant registered a case against the appellant and all male family members, including a juvenile.
* The appellantclaims to be innocent and argues that the prosecution's story is exaggerated and does not make sense.
* The prosecution argues that the appellant was involved in the crime and was found guilty during the investigation. Here is a summary of the court document:

The appellant is appealing a conviction for murder under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The prosecution claims that the appellant, along with co-accused, committed the murder of Ghulam Bibi on July 14, 2011, in front of a shop in Bhowana. The appellant, on the other hand, claims that he acted in self-defense after Ghulam Bibi and Faheem attacked him over a previous altercation.

The prosecution's version of events is that the appellant and co-accused assaulted Ghulam Bibi and Faheem, and the appellant fired multiple shots at Ghulam Bibi, causing her death. The appellant's version is that he was attacked by Ghulam Bibi and Faheem, and he fired in self-defense, resulting in injuries to both Ghulam Bibi and Faheem.

The court has reviewed the evidence and arguments from both sides. While the prosecution acknowledges that the sentence may not be commensurate with the facts of the case, the appellant argues that the prosecution's version of events is not supported by the evidence. The court will determine the mode and manner of the occurrence, which is the key issue in the case. The appellant, Shahbaz, was accused of murder and was investigated by the police. During the investigation, 21 people, including Irfan, Nazeer Ahmed, and others, came forward and submitted affidavits supporting the appellant's version of events, stating that they were present at the crime scene and witnessed the occurrence. However, not a single person from the complainant side came forward to rebut the appellant's plea or to negate the affidavits of the 21 witnesses. The investigating officer, Muhammad Iqbal, testified that the appellant's version was supported by the 21 witnesses, and none from the complainant side appeared to contradict their statements.

The court considered the admissibility of the first plea of the accused, and pursuant to Article 27 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, the court held that the statements of the 21 witnesses were relevant and admissible as they formed part of the same transaction. The court relied on the precedent set by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the case of Shabbir Hussain vs. The State, which held that statements, utterances, and declarations are admissible as "res gestae" if they are contemporaneous with the occurrence or incident in issue.

The court also noted that the prosecution case was that besides the appellant, three others were present at the scene of the crime, but during the investigation, the investigating officer concluded that except for the appellant, the others were not linked with the occurrence, and they were acquitted of the charge. The presence of the appellant at the place of occurrence was admitted by the trial court. Here is a summary of the text:

The court is evaluating an appeal in a murder case where the appellant, Shahbaz, was convicted under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The court finds that both the prosecution and defense have not presented their cases with clean hands. After reviewing the evidence and circumstances, the court concludes that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant under Section 302(b) and that the evidence only supports a conviction under Section 302(c) of the PPC. The court cites several precedents, including Supreme Court of Pakistan cases, to support its decision. These cases highlight the importance of carefully evaluating evidence and considering the attending circumstances in cases where parties may not present the full truth. Ultimately, the court reduces the appellant's conviction from Section 302(b) to Section 302(c) of the PPC. Here's a summary:

The court is reviewing a murder case where the appellant (the person convicted) was 20/21 years old at the time of the incident. Considering his young age and lack of prior criminal record, the court decides to give him a chance to reform and live a better life. The maximum punishment for the crime at the time was up to 25 years imprisonment, but the appellant has already served over 7 years in prison. Therefore, the court modifies his sentence to 14 years imprisonment, but maintains the conviction and sentence for related charges under Sections 324 and 337-F(i) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The sentences will run concurrently, and the appellant will benefit from Section 382-B of the Cr.P.C. The death sentence is not confirmed, and the appeal is dismissed with the modified sentence.
