Here is a summary of the document:

* The document is a court order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a criminal petition (No. 1199 of 2017) dated February 28, 2018.
* The petition was filed by Rahat Shah against the State and another respondent, appealing a judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated September 11, 2017.
* The case involves a murder that took place on August 28, 2014, in Charsadda, Pakistan, in which the deceased, Azeem Shah, was allegedly killed by his father and brother, along with another person, over a dispute related to landed property.
* The Supreme Court justices, Mr. Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa and Mr. Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, heard the appeal and found that there was no established motive for the crime and that the prosecution's case was weak.
* The court noted several inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including the fact that the solitary eyewitness, Rahat Shah, had not seen the occurrence, and that the medical evidence did not support the prosecution's version of events.
* Based on these findings, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the Peshawar High Court. Here is a summary:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissed a petition against a lower court's decision to acquit Respondent No. 2. The High Court had found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the Supreme Court agrees with this conclusion. As a result, the petition is dismissed and leave to appeal is denied.
