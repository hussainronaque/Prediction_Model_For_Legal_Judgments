Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

* The Lahore High Court is hearing two connected cases: a criminal appeal (Criminal Appeal No.820 of 2016) and a criminal revision (Criminal Revision No.554 of 2016).
* The appeal is filed by Azhar, who was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court in 2016 for his role in the murder of Ahmad Ali.
* The revision is filed by the complainant, Dost Muhammad, who is seeking enhancement of Azhar's sentence from life imprisonment to death, and also seeking an increase in compensation to the victim's family.
* The case arises from an incident on December 2, 2008, in which Azhar, along with co-accused Ahmad Sher and Hassan, allegedly attacked and killed Ahmad Ali.
* The trial court had acquitted Ahmad Sher and Hassan, but convicted Azhar and sentenced him to life imprisonment and ordered him to pay Rs.2,00,000 as compensation to the victim's family.
* The appeal and revision are being heard together, and the court has heard arguments from both sides, including the appellant (Azhar), the state, and the complainant (Dost Muhammad).
* The court's judgment will determine whether Azhar's conviction and sentence will be upheld, and whether the sentence will be enhanced to death as sought by the complainant. Here is a summary of the case:

The appellant, Azhar, was one of five co-accused who allegedly stopped a motorcycle and shot the occupants, Ahmad Ali (who died) and Rab Nawaz (PW-2), at gunpoint. The accused made multiple shots, hitting both victims in their legs. The victims fell to the ground, and the accused fled the scene, taking the motorcycle with them. Rab Nawaz was injured and taken to the hospital, while Ahmad Ali died at the scene.

The complainant, Dost Muhammad (PW-1), filed a FIR, and the police investigated the case. The appellant was arrested, and the challan was submitted to the trial court. The prosecution presented 13 witnesses, including Rab Nawaz, and documentary evidence. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The trial court found the appellant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

The appellant's lawyer argues that the appellant is innocent and was falsely implicated by the complainant and the local police. The lawyer also disputes the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, including Rab Nawaz, and claims that the conviction was based on unreliable evidence. Here is a summary of the arguments made by the defense and prosecution in a criminal appeal:

**Defense Arguments:**

* The injuries on the body of Rab Nawaz (PW-2) do not necessarily mean he was telling the truth.
* The court had disbelieved Rab Nawaz's evidence in relation to co-accused Ahmed Sher and Hassan, who were acquitted, and therefore, his evidence should not be believed against the appellant without independent corroboration, which is lacking.
* The recovery of a 12-bore gun from the appellant is inconsequential without forensic evidence.
* No specific motive was alleged against the appellant, and the prosecution failed to prove any motive.
* There are material contradictions in the prosecution evidence that were not properly appreciated by the trial court.
* The prosecution failed to prove its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the appeal should be accepted, and the appellant acquitted.

**Prosecution Arguments:**

* The prosecution has proved its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.
* The co-accused Ahmed Sher and Hassan were acquitted because they were found innocent during the police investigation, whereas the appellant was found guilty.
* The recovery of a 12-bore gun from the appellant corroborates the prosecution case against him.
* The appellant was an absconder in the case for a considerable period, which further corroborates the prosecution case.
* The appellant was assigned a specific role in the crime, which is supported by medical evidence.
* The prosecution eyewitnesses withstood cross-examination, and their evidence was not shaken.
* There is no substance in the appeal, and it should be dismissed.
* Additionally, the complainant's counsel argues that Azhar (respondent No.2) was wrongly awarded a lesser punishment and should be awarded the normal penalty of death. Here's a summary:

The court is reviewing a criminal case where the appellant, Azhar, was convicted and sentenced based on the evidence of an injured eyewitness, Rab Nawaz (PW-2). The court notes that the evidence of two other eyewitnesses, Dost Muhammad (PW-1) and Muhammad Yousaf (PW-3), was disbelieved by the trial court. The court cites a previous judgment that injuries on a witness do not necessarily mean they are telling the truth.

The court also notes that Azhar was accused of making a fire shot that landed on the right foot of the deceased, Ahmad Ali, while a co-accused, Ahmad Sher, was accused of making a fire shot that landed on the right calf of the deceased. However, Ahmad Sher was acquitted by the trial court, and the acquittal has become final since no appeal was filed against it.

The court argues that if the prosecution's evidence is disbelieved for one accused, it cannot be believed against another accused without independent corroboration. In this case, the evidence against Azhar is similar to that against Ahmad Sher, and since Ahmad Sher was acquitted, the court questions why Azhar should be convicted.

The court also notes that the medical evidence shows that all the injuries on the deceased's body were the cause of death, and therefore, Azhar's case is not distinguishable from that of the acquitted co-accused on medical grounds. Here's a summary of the text:

The appellant, Azhar, was accused of a crime and a 12-bore gun (P-2) was recovered from his possession. However, the Punjab Forensic Science Agency did not report any match between the empty shells found at the crime scene and the gun (P-2), making the recovery of the gun inconsequential for the prosecution's case. Additionally, there was no independent corroboration of the prosecution's case against Azhar.

The motive behind the crime was allegedly a murder that took place a year prior, but the specific motive was only alleged against Faiz-ul-Hassan (a co-accused who has since died) and not against Azhar. The prosecution cannot seek independent corroboration against Azhar from the alleged motive.

The police investigation found Ahmad Sher and Hassan (co-accused who were acquitted) to be innocent, while Azhar was found guilty. However, the court notes that police opinion/finding regarding the innocence or guilt of an accused becomes irrelevant after the recording of evidence and is inadmissible in evidence. The court cites a previous case, "Muhammad Ahmad (Mahmood Ahmed) and another Vs. The State" (2010 SCMR 660), which states that the determination of guilt or innocence is the exclusive domain of the courts and cannot be exercised by the police or anyone else. The text appears to be a legal document or judgment from a Pakistani court. The main argument is that the prosecution's case against the appellant (defendant) is weak and cannot be distinguished from the case of a co-accused, Ahmad Sher, who was acquitted. The court argues that if the investigating officer's opinion was not enough to convict Ahmad Sher, then it should not be enough to convict the appellant.

The court also rejects the prosecution's argument that the appellant's abscondance after the incident corroborates their guilt, citing several Supreme Court judgments that held that mere abscondance is not conclusive proof of guilt.

Furthermore, the court notes that the prosecution's evidence against the appellant is the same as that against Ahmad Sher, and since that evidence was disbelieved in Ahmad Sher's case, it cannot be relied upon to convict the appellant without independent corroboration, which is lacking in this case.

The court also references several other Supreme Court judgments that support the principle that the same evidence cannot be relied upon to convict one accused person while acquitting another, and that there must be independent corroboration to sustain a conviction.

Finally, the court notes that the complainant party implicated five accused in the case, but the prosecution's case against the appellant is not strong enough to warrant a conviction. Here's a summary:

The judge is acquitting Azhar, the appellant, of the charge of murder (Section 302(b) PPC) due to lack of convincing evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution had implicated 7 accused persons, including Azhar, with varying injuries inflicted on the deceased and co-accused Rab Nawaz (PW-2). However, the judge suspects that the complainant may have falsely implicated Azhar using a "wider net". After reviewing the case, the judge concludes that the prosecution failed to prove its case against Azhar and therefore sets aside his conviction and sentence. Azhar is to be released from custody immediately, unless required in another case. Additionally, the judge dismisses a related criminal revision petition filed by the complainant seeking enhancement of Azhar's sentence from life imprisonment to death and compensation.
