* The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal and refused to grant leave to appeal.
* The case involves a murder and injury of Zard Ali and Asghar Jan, respectively, allegedly committed by Basit and three others.
* The Supreme Court has upheld the decision of the Peshawar High Court, which had acquitted Basit due to lack of evidence and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case.
