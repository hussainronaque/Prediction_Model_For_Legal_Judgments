Here's a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case Details:**

* Case No. Cr.M/QP No.74-P/2019
* Petitioners: Secretary to Govt. of KPK, Peshawar, etc.
* Respondents: Tajdar Khan, etc.

**Background:**

* A motor vehicle with registration No. LEC-102 was seized by the Intelligence Bureau of Excise Taxation & Narcotics Control Department, KP, Peshawar due to suspicion of having bogus registration documents and tampered chassis.
* Forensic analysis confirmed tampering with the chassis, and the registration documents were declared bogus after verification with the concerned Registration Authority, Lahore.
* The respondent, Tajdar Khan, claiming to be the owner and lost possessor, applied for interim custody of the vehicle, which was granted by the learned Sessions Judge, Nowshera.

**Petition:**

* The petitioners (Government of KPK) have challenged the impugned judgment dated 18.09.2019, requesting that the vehicle be kept in custody of the Provincial Warehouse for further process of confiscation in favor of the State.

**Arguments:**

* Petitioners' counsel argued that the learned Court has no jurisdiction to grant interim custody of the vehicle, as it is not case property described under Section 516-A Cr.PC.
* Respondent's counsel argued that the vehicle is case property of FIR No. 44 and was released on bail/interim custody by the competent Court of law.

**Judgment:**

* The judgment is not explicitly stated, but it appears that the Court has heard the arguments of both parties and is considering the facts and laws applicable to the case. Here is a summary of the text:

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has established rules for seizing and confiscating motor vehicles involved in criminal cases. Under the Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1965, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Road Checking, Seizure and Disposal of Motor Vehicles) Rules, 2015, law enforcement agencies can seize vehicles that are illegal, have suspicious registration or chassis numbers, are used in criminal activities, or have other issues. The rules prescribe procedures for seizing, storing, and disposing of such vehicles. If the seizing authority decides to confiscate the vehicle, it must issue a notice to the owner or last possessor, who has 14 days to respond and establish their claim of ownership. If the owner responds, the District Officer will decide on the claim within 14 days. If there are rival claims, the case may be referred to the Director General for extension of the period. Here's a summary of the text:

**Vehicle Confiscation Rules**

* If a vehicle is seized, the owner/possessor has 30 days to establish rightful ownership.
* If ownership is established, the confiscating authority must issue a release order and direct the warehouse officer to return the vehicle to the owner.
* If the vehicle's chassis, frame, or registration is tampered with, it may be confiscated by the government.
* The owner can appeal the confiscation order to the Deputy Director (Regional) within 15 days, and then to the Deputy Director General within 30 days.
* The Secretary to Government can also review the order and pass a new one within 60 days.

**Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 516-A**

* Allows a criminal court to make orders for the custody and disposal of property pending trial in certain cases.
* The court can order the property to be sold or disposed of if it's perishable or if it's a dangerous substance.
* The property can be returned to a government department or authorized dealer in certain cases. Here is a summary of the court document:

* The petitioners (likely law enforcement or authorities) seized a motor vehicle with a forged registration number and a tampered chassis frame.
* The respondents (likely the owners or claimants of the vehicle) had requested that the vehicle be returned to them, but the petitioners refused.
* The court considered the issue and found that the seizure of the vehicle was lawful under the Motor Vehicles Rules, 2015.
* The court rejected the respondents' claim that the vehicle was case property in a separate criminal case (FIR No. 44) and noted that the seized vehicle had a different chassis number than the one mentioned in the FIR.
* The court set aside the impugned judgment dated 18.09.2019, which had ordered the vehicle to be handed over to the respondents.
* Instead, the court ordered that the vehicle be re-taken into custody by the petitioners and that the matter be decided in accordance with the law, allowing the petitioners or other claimants to prove legal ownership of the vehicle.

In essence, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners and allowed them to keep the seized vehicle, pending further proceedings to determine its legal ownership.
