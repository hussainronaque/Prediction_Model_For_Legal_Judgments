**Judgment:**

* The judgment is not explicitly stated in this document, but it appears to be an appeal against the conviction and sentence imposed by the lower court. Here's a summary of the text:

The case involves a criminal appeal by the appellant, who was convicted of a crime. The prosecution presented several witnesses, including the complainant, eye witnesses, and a police officer. The appellant claimed that he was falsely accused due to a personal vendetta by the complainant, who was unhappy about the appellant's sister marrying his son.

The appellant's lawyer argued that the prosecution's case was weak and that the most important evidence, the call data records (CDR) of the complainant and an eye witness, was not taken into possession. The lawyer also questioned the credibility of the eye witnesses, saying that their conduct was unnatural and that they failed to inform the police about the crime. Additionally, the children of the appellant and the deceased were present at the crime scene but were not examined as witnesses.

The prosecutor, on the other hand, argued that the two eye witnesses were credible and had no enmity with the appellant. The prosecutor also pointed out that the appellant was supposed to be present at the crime scene and failed to inform the police about the crime. Furthermore, the medical evidence and recovery of an iron rod corroborated the ocular account of the witnesses.

The appeal court heard the arguments and noted that the complainant received a phone call from an eye witness informing him about the crime, which was made from a location far from the crime scene. The court also noted that the call data records could have been used to establish the sequence of events, but they were not taken into possession. This is a court document discussing a criminal appeal. The main points are:

1. The investigation into the case was incomplete, as mobile phone data (CDR) was not collected to verify communication between the complainant and Imran Khan, which could have provided crucial evidence.
2. The defense had requested CDR records, but it was unsuccessful, suggesting that the prosecution may have been hiding something.
3. The conduct of Imran Khan, Haq Nawaz, and Khurram Shahzad, who were all present at the scene of the crime, is suspicious. They claimed to have tried to calm down the appellant, but did not stop the assault or report it to the police.
4. The police were not informed of the incident until the complainant arrived at 11:00/11:30 am, despite the presence of Imran Khan, Haq Nawaz, and others at the scene.
5. The conduct of the complainant's family, including his wife and son, is also questionable, as they did not report the incident to the police.
6. Imran Khan and Haq Nawaz are considered "chance witnesses" despite residing in the same vicinity, as their testimonies have inconsistencies and unexplained aspects.
7. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has previously ruled that the arrival of witnesses at a crime scene exactly at the time of the incident raises suspicions about the prosecution's case.

Overall, the document suggests that there are several inconsistencies and suspicious aspects in the investigation and testimonies of the witnesses, which may impact the credibility of the prosecution's case. Here's a summary of the case "Muhammad Imran vs. The State 2020 SCMR 857":

The Supreme Court of Pakistan observed that the investigation in a murder case was flawed and malicious. The prosecution's witnesses had contradictions in their statements, and their presence at the crime scene was questionable. The investigation officer, Qamar Sultan, was found to be dishonest and had failed to properly investigate the case.

The case involved the murder of a man, and the appellant, Muhammad Imran, was accused of the crime. The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of witnesses who claimed to have seen the appellant inflicting blows on the deceased. However, the court found that these witnesses had contradictions in their statements and were not credible.

The court also criticized the investigation officer for not interviewing the two sons of the deceased, who were minors, despite being potential witnesses to the crime. The court held that the law does not prohibit recording the statements of minors, and the investigation officer's failure to do so was a deliberate attempt to keep important evidence from the court.

The court also found that the complainant's conduct was malafide and unfair, as they had accused two women of abetment in the crime but failed to produce any evidence against them. The medical evidence presented in the case was also found to be incomplete and unreliable.

Overall, the court's judgment suggests that the prosecution's case was weak and based on flawed investigation and unreliable witnesses. The appellant's conviction was likely to be overturned due to the authorities' failure to conduct a fair and impartial investigation. Here is a summary of the text:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that medical evidence is only confirmatory and supporting in nature, and cannot be used to identify the culprit. This means that medical evidence can only provide information about the nature of injuries, the type of weapon used, and the time of death, but it cannot be used to prove the identity of the perpetrator.

Additionally, the recovery of a weapon or object related to the crime is only a corroborative piece of evidence, and in the absence of substantive evidence, it is not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused person.

In the case being discussed, the prosecution's evidence is weak, and the motive for the crime has not been proven. The only evidence against the accused is that the body was found in the house where he and the deceased were living. However, this is not sufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and the prosecution has failed to provide any substantive evidence to connect the accused to the crime.

The court has relied on previous judgments to support its view that the prosecution must prove its case independently and cannot rely on presumptions or weaknesses in the defense. The burden of proof remains on the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused cannot be convicted merely on the basis of a presumption or circumstantial evidence. This is a judgment from a Pakistani court. Here is a summary:

The appeal of Ghulam Rasool has been allowed, and he is acquitted from the case. The prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The judgment of the lower court dated 18.08.2020 is set aside. Ghulam Rasool, who is currently in custody, will be released immediately unless he is required in another case. The court also directs that the case property will be handled in the same manner as directed by the trial court. This judgment is approved for reporting.
