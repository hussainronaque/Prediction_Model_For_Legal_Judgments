Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case Details**

* Case Number: Criminal Appeal No. 445 of 2013
* Parties: Allah Rakkha (Appellant) vs. The State and another (Mohammad Riaz, respondent No.2/complainant)
* Date of Hearing: October 5, 2021

**Background**

* On July 24/25, 2010, Ahmad Khan alias Baggu (brother of Mohammad Riaz) was allegedly murdered by the appellants, including Allah Rakkha, due to suspicion of illicit relations with a relative, Rani Mai.
* Mohammad Riaz, the complainant, filed a private complaint on January 4, 2011, against the appellants, alleging that they had threatened and killed his brother.
* The police investigation was allegedly compromised, leading the complainant to file a private complaint.

**Trial**

* The trial court framed charges against the appellants under Sections 302/148/149 PPC (murder, rioting, and common intention).
* The prosecution presented 10 witnesses, including the complainant, and two court witnesses (the Investigating Officer and a doctor).
* The appellant, Allah Rakkha, denied the allegations and claimed that the case was concocted and witnesses had deposed falsely.

**Current Status**

* The appeal is pending before the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, with the judgment dated October 5, 2021. This is a court appeal document. Here's a summary:

* The appellant, Allah Rakkha, was convicted in a criminal case and is now appealing the decision.
* The prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence, which means that there is no direct evidence of the crime, but rather a series of facts and circumstances that lead to an inference of guilt.
* The appellant did not produce defense evidence or appear in court, and their lawyer is also not present.
* The court is proceeding to decide the appeal based on the available record, with the assistance of the learned Additional District Public Prosecutor (ADPP).
* The ADPP argues that the circumstantial evidence is strong and successfully links each piece together, and the recovery of the dead body at the instance of the appellant is a strong piece of evidence that supports the conviction.
* The court discusses the principles of circumstantial evidence, citing various definitions and explanations from legal sources.
* The appeal is being decided based on the available record, and the court will determine whether the conviction was justified based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The article discusses the concept of circumstantial evidence in Islamic Law and compares it with the Common Law system. In Islamic Law, circumstantial evidence is referred to as "Alqariinah", which means connection, conjunction, relation, presumption, inference, or indication. It refers to circumstances surrounding an event that can be used to draw an inference about the existence or non-existence of an issue under investigation.

The basis of admissibility of circumstantial evidence in Islamic Law is found in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. The article cites verses from the Quran, specifically from Surat Yusuf (Chapter 12), which tells the story of Prophet Yusuf and his brothers, as well as the story of Prophet Yusuf and his master's wife.

In the first story, the brothers of Prophet Yusuf bring a torn shirt with fake blood to deceive their father, claiming that a wolf had devoured Yusuf. However, their father, based on circumstantial evidence (the un-torn shirt), disproves their tale and accuses them of making up a story.

In the second story, Prophet Yusuf is accused by his master's wife of attempted seduction. However, a witness testifies that if Yusuf's shirt is torn from the front, then the wife's tale is true, but if it is torn from the back, then she is lying. When the husband sees the shirt torn from the back, he concludes that it is a plot by his wife.

The article shows that Islamic Law has a long tradition of using circumstantial evidence in criminal proceedings, and that the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet provide guidance on its admissibility and evaluation. The text discusses the concept of circumstantial evidence in criminal cases, using the story of Yusuf and the woman as an example. In this story, Yusuf's shirt is torn from the back, which serves as circumstantial evidence that the woman was trying to seduce him and he was trying to escape. The master believes Yusuf's account and accuses the woman of plotting against him.

The text then lists the principles for evaluating circumstantial evidence, as established by the apex court:

1. Circumstantial evidence must be examined with caution and care.
2. Inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence can be fallacious if not careful.
3. Only well-established circumstances should be used as the basis for inferences.
4. A high quality of evidence is required to prove facts and circumstances leading to an inference of guilt.
5. The court should be cautious of fabrication of evidence in cases based solely on circumstantial evidence.
6. The court should examine the evidence with a "pure judicial approach" and strict legal standards to ensure its reliability.
7. If there are indications of fabricated evidence, the court must be watchful and satisfy itself about the fairness and genuineness of the evidence.

Finally, the text states that if no hypothesis consistent with the innocence of the accused can be suggested based on the facts and circumstances, the case is fit for conviction. The text discusses the principles of circumstantial evidence in criminal cases, particularly in murder cases. It cites various Pakistani court cases and foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, the UK, and Canada. The main points are:

1. Circumstantial evidence should be treated like a well-knit chain, where each link connects the accused to the crime.
2. No link in the chain should be broken, and the circumstances should be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused.
3. The chain of evidence must be complete to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
4. If any link is missing, the entire chain is unreliable, and conviction cannot be safely recorded, especially in capital cases.
5. The circumstantial evidence must be of high standard and quality to support a conviction.
6. It is essential to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved, and the evidence must lead to a moral certainty of guilt.
7. The "links in a chain" metaphor is often used, but it is not entirely accurate, as it suggests that if one link breaks, the entire chain fails. Instead, the "strands in a cable" metaphor is more apt, where multiple strands together can provide sufficient evidence.
8. In Australia, circumstantial evidence is considered very often the best, and it is essential to consider whether the circumstances actually exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.
9. In the UK, it is recognized that multiple strands of evidence, even if individually insufficient, can together create a strong conclusion of guilt.
10. In Canada, circumstantial evidence must be assessed in the light of human experience.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of careful consideration and evaluation of circumstantial evidence in criminal cases, particularly in murder cases, to ensure that the accused is proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. The text discusses the principles of appreciating circumstantial evidence in a court of law, particularly in the context of criminal cases. The key points are:

1. Circumstantial evidence must exclude all other reasonable alternatives and be based on reasonable inferences, not speculation.
2. The inference of guilt can only be justified when all incriminating facts and circumstances are incompatible with the innocence of the accused.
3. The circumstances must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and be closely connected to the principal fact sought to be inferred.
4. The cumulative effect of the circumstances must be strong enough to negate the innocence of the accused and bring the offense home beyond reasonable doubt.
5. All circumstances should be complete, with no gaps in the chain of evidence.
6. The circumstances must be cogently and firmly established, with a definite tendency pointing towards the guilt of the accused.
7. Judges must be careful and critical when appreciating circumstantial evidence, as it can be delicate and requires great care and caution.

The text also references Islamic law and other jurisdictions, highlighting the similar principles applied in these contexts.

In the specific case being discussed, the prosecution's evidence is being examined and appreciated. The prosecution's case relies on confessions made by the accused, but the witnesses who were supposed to testify to these confessions were not produced, and the prosecution claimed they were won over by the accused. This has broken the chain of evidence, making it difficult to establish guilt. Additionally, the complainant's testimony about the accused threatening the victim is deemed unnatural and doubtful, and there are questions about why the matter was not reported to the police earlier. Here's a summary of the text:

The court is questioning the credibility of the prosecution's case due to several inconsistencies and defects in the evidence presented. Specifically:

* The complainant and witnesses Muhammad Riaz and Sajid Amin claim to have seen the accused together near a gutter at 11/11:30 pm on the night of the incident, but their testimony is questionable because they didn't inform the police immediately after discovering the incident, and their alibi for being in the area at that time is unclear.
* The witnesses' stories about why they were in the area that night are inconsistent and unproven, and they failed to provide evidence to support their claims.
* The prosecution's claim that the accused was apprehended and the dead body was recovered at his instance is also suspect, as the witnesses' testimony is inconsistent about the time of the recovery and how the accused was able to escape.
* The court believes that the foundation of the case is defective due to these inconsistencies and defects in the evidence, and therefore, the prosecution has failed to prove its case. Here is a summary of the text:

The document appears to be a legal analysis of a criminal case, specifically a murder trial. The writer is highlighting several contradictions and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case against the appellant.

* The timing of the police investigation is disputed, with different witnesses giving conflicting accounts of when the police arrived at the crime scene and when the dead body was taken to the hospital for autopsy.
* The complaint was completed at 8:00 am, but the statement of one witness, Muhammad Riaz, claims the police arrived at 10:00 am.
* The post-mortem examination was conducted at 3:00 pm, but the dead body was allegedly received at the hospital at 11:00 am, raising questions about the delay in conducting the autopsy.
* The writer cites previous court cases where similar delays in post-mortem examinations were held to be suspicious and indicative of police tampering with evidence.
* The writer notes that other accused in the case were acquitted, and questions why the same evidence should be relied upon to convict the appellant.
* The writer concludes by reiterating that it is the prosecution's burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the inconsistencies and contradictions in this case undermine the prosecution's case. Here is a summary of the text:

The judge ruled in favor of the appellant, Allah Rakkha, and overturned the conviction. The judge found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore the appellant is entitled to the benefit of doubt as a matter of right, not grace. The trial court erred in relying on the prosecution's version and ignoring settled principles for appreciating circumstantial evidence. As a result, the conviction is unsustainable, and the appellant is acquitted. The appellant, who is currently on bail, is released from their bail bonds, and their surety is discharged.
