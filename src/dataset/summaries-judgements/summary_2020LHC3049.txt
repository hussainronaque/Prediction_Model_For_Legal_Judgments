The author is discussing a court case involving the prosecution of an individual for possessing narcotics. The prosecution submitted a report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency as evidence, but the report lacks details on the protocols and tests applied to analyze the sample. The author cites several Supreme Court of Pakistan judgments, including "Muhammad Hashim V. The State" and "Ameer Zeb V. The State", which emphasize that the standard of proof must be stricter in cases with harsh sentences.

The author notes that the report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency does not meet the standards set by the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001, which require the analyst to mention the results of the material analyzed, along with the full protocols applied, in the report. The author also cites the Supreme Court judgment in "The State through Regional Director ANF Vs. Imam Bakhsh and others", which states that non-compliance with Rule 6 can frustrate the purpose of the Act and lead to unreliable and inconclusive reports.

The author concludes that the report submitted by the prosecution is unreliable and untrustworthy due to its failure to provide detailed protocols and tests applied, and therefore, the evidence cannot be used to sustain a conviction. The document appears to be a court judgment in a criminal appeal case in Pakistan. Here's a summary:

The appellant, Riaz Ahmad, was convicted of a crime related to the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. The conviction was based on a report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, which was submitted as evidence. However, the report did not mention the protocols or full details of the tests applied, which is a crucial requirement.

The court pointed out that the Supreme Court of Pakistan had emphasized the importance of protocols in a previous case, Ikramullah's case. The court also referred to a recent case, Khair-ul-Bashar Vs. The State (2019 SCMR 930), where the Supreme Court had acquitted the accused on the same ground of non-mentioning of protocols/full details of the tests applied in the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore.

The court held that the report of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency, Lahore, in the present case was not worthy of reliance due to the same error. The court further stated that a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt would be sufficient to cast doubt about the veracity of the prosecution case, and the benefit of doubt must be extended to the accused as a matter of right.

Consequently, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned judgment, and acquitted the appellant, Riaz Ahmad, of the charge. The appellant was directed to be released from custody forthwith, if not required in any other case.
