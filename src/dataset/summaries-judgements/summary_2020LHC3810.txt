Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

* The Lahore High Court heard two connected cases: Criminal Appeal No. 1238 of 2013 filed by Raiyet Ali against his conviction and sentence, and Criminal Revision No. 723 of 2013 filed by Muhammad Yahya seeking enhancement of Raiyet Ali's sentence from imprisonment for life to death.
* Both cases arise from the same judgment dated June 27, 2013, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Chunian, District Kasur.
* Raiyet Ali was convicted of murdering his wife, Mst. Khursheed Bibi, under Section 302 PPC and sentenced to imprisonment for life, with a fine of Rs. 2,00,000/- and additional simple imprisonment of six months in case of default.
* The prosecution's case was that Raiyet Ali was unhappy with his wife because she was unable to bear more children and he wanted to marry again. He used to beat her and had illicit relationships with other women.
* On the night of September 16, 2010, Raiyet Ali murdered his wife, either by strangulation or other means, and then told his brother and sister-in-law that she had died due to electric shock. He did not inform the complainant party, despite living nearby.
* The complainant, Muhammad Yahya, is the brother of the deceased and had filed a complaint against Raiyet Ali. He is seeking enhancement of Raiyet Ali's sentence to death.

The judgment sheet does not indicate the final decision or outcome of the cases. Here is a summary of the text:

A woman named Mst. Khursheed Bibi was found dead in her bathroom by her relatives, including Mst. Surraya Bibi and Muhammad Yahya. They noticed a ligature mark around her neck and reported the incident to the police. The complainant, Muhammad Yahya, later accused his brother-in-law, Raiyat Ali (the appellant), of murdering Mst. Khursheed Bibi by strangling her. He alleged that Raiyat Ali had obtained intoxicated tablets from a fake doctor named Muhammad Aslam to give to Mst. Khursheed Bibi and her daughter before killing her. Muhammad Aslam was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Raiyat Ali was arrested, charged, and convicted of the murder by the trial court. He appealed the decision, arguing that there were no eyewitnesses, no circumstantial evidence, and that the prosecution's case was based on suspicion. The appellant's lawyer also pointed out inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including the lack of evidence related to mobile phone records and discrepancies in the estimated time of death. Here's a summary of the arguments presented in the appeal:

**Appellant's arguments:**

* The prosecution's case is based on an inadmissible extra-judicial confession made by the appellant while in police custody.
* The alleged recovery of a dupatta (scarf) was planted to strengthen the weak prosecution case.
* The dupatta was not stained with any incriminating material and was of a common pattern, making it of no avail to the prosecution.
* The motive alleged by the prosecution has not been proven.
* The prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the appellant should be acquitted.

**Prosecution's arguments:**

* The prosecution has proven its case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.
* The witnesses for the prosecution, including the complainant and his nephew, had no previous enmity with the appellant and therefore had no motive to falsely implicate him.
* The appellant had a duty to explain the cause of death of the deceased, but instead, he fled the scene and failed to inform the police.
* The prosecution witnesses withstood lengthy cross-examination, and their evidence was not shaken.
* The medical evidence supports the prosecution's case, showing that the deceased died from strangulation and a fractured hyoid bone.
* The recovery of the dupatta on the pointation of the appellant corroborates the prosecution's case.
* The motive alleged by the prosecution has been proven through the evidence of the witnesses.

The prosecution is seeking to dismiss the appeal, while the appellant is seeking acquittal. Here is a summary of the text:

The court is considering a criminal appeal and revision in a case where the appellant has been sentenced to life imprisonment for a crime. The prosecution is arguing that the sentence should be enhanced to death. The court acknowledges that there is no direct evidence in the case and that the prosecution's case relies on circumstantial evidence. The court notes that in such cases, utmost care and caution are required to reach a just decision.

The court cites various judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which emphasize that in cases of circumstantial evidence, every circumstance should be linked together to form a continuous chain that points to the guilt of the accused. If any link in the chain is missing, the benefit goes to the accused.

The court then outlines the prosecution's evidence, which consists of:

1. Circumstantial evidence from two witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) regarding a false information allegedly given by the appellant about the death of the deceased, and the appellant's disappearance after the occurrence.
2. Motive
3. Recovery of the weapon of offence (a dupatta) and the deceased's body from the appellant's house.

The court will discuss each piece of evidence separately to determine whether it forms a continuous chain that points to the guilt of the appellant. Here is a summary of the text:

The prosecution's case against Raiyet Ali (appellant) is based on circumstantial evidence, which includes:

1. Evidence of an extrajudicial confession made by Raiyet Ali to Muhammad Yahya (complainant and PW-1) while in police custody.
2. Testimony of Muhammad Yahya (PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2) regarding a false information allegedly given by Raiyet Ali to the complainant party about the death of his wife, Mst. Khursheed Bibi, due to electric shock.
3. The suspicious behavior of Raiyet Ali, including his disappearance after the occurrence.

However, it is noted that:

1. The prosecution witnesses, Muhammad Yahya (PW-1) and Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2), are not eye-witnesses and did not witness the last seen evidence.
2. Their evidence is based on suspicion against the appellant due to the alleged false information given by him.
3. Hafiz Muhammad Tariq (PW-2) testified that Raiyet Ali informed him about the death of his wife due to electric shock over the phone, and provided his own cell phone number and the cell phone number of Raiyet Ali.
4. However, the investigating officer did not take possession of the cell phone sets or collect data to establish that wrong information was given by Raiyet Ali.

Overall, the prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence, and the reliability of the prosecution witnesses' testimony is questionable due to the lack of concrete evidence and inconsistencies in their statements. Here is a summary of the text:

The case involves the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi, whose body was found in the house of her husband Raiyet Ali (the appellant). The prosecution's case rests on circumstantial evidence, including the fact that Raiyet Ali did not report his wife's death to the police and fled the scene. However, the court notes that suspicion, no matter how strong, cannot replace conclusive proof, which is required to convict and sentence someone for a capital crime.

The prosecution's case also relies on a motive, alleging that Raiyet Ali was unhappy with his wife because she only bore a female child and that he had illicit relations with other women. However, the witnesses failed to provide any evidence to support this motive, and one of the witnesses even admitted that he had no evidence to back up his claims.

The court cites precedents from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, including the case of "Muhammad Jamshaid and another Vs. The State and others" (2016 SCMR 1019), which states that suspicion, no matter how strong, cannot replace proof beyond reasonable doubt. Here's a summary of the text:

The case involves the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi, allegedly at the hands of her husband Raiyet Ali (the appellant). The prosecution claimed that Raiyet Ali had motives to kill his wife, including beating her and having illicit relationships with other women. However, during cross-examination, the prosecution witnesses admitted that they had not personally witnessed Raiyet Ali beating his wife or having illicit relationships. The witnesses' statements were based on hearsay evidence, and no specific woman was named as being involved in an illicit relationship with Raiyet Ali. Furthermore, the deceased was living with her minor daughter in Raiyet Ali's house until her death, and no family or civil suit was filed by her against Raiyet Ali to establish any matrimonial dispute.

The prosecution also claimed that a dupatta (scarf) was used to strangle the deceased, and was recovered from Raiyet Ali's house on his pointation. However, the witness who testified to the recovery of the dupatta was unable to describe the place where it was found and admitted that it was a common pattern easily available in the market.

Overall, the evidence presented does not support the prosecution's claims of motive or recovery of the weapon of offence, leading to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proved its case. Here's a summary of the text:

The appeals court is reviewing a case where the appellant, Raiyet Ali, was convicted of murdering his wife, Mst. Khursheed Bibi. The prosecution's evidence is being questioned. 

* The recovery of a dupatta (scarf) from the appellant's house is deemed insignificant because the appellant couldn't describe the room where it was found, indicating he never visited the place, and the dupatta was of a common pattern, not stained with any incriminating material.
* The recovery of the dead body from the appellant's house is also not deemed sufficient evidence to convict him, as mere presence of the body does not prove guilt. The Supreme Court has ruled that in the absence of other reliable evidence, a dead body found in an accused's house does not justify conviction.
* The medical evidence is also conflicting, with the doctor's testimony contradicting the prosecution's account of the time of death. The doctor's post-mortem examination report suggests the death occurred 7-8 hours before the examination, which contradicts the prosecution's claim.

In summary, the appeals court is highlighting the weakness of the prosecution's evidence and the need for more concrete proof to convict the appellant of murder. Here is a summary of the text:

The case involves the death of Mst. Khursheed Bibi on September 17, 2010. The prosecution claims that the complainant party received news of her death at 3:30 am, but the medical evidence from Dr. Tasneem Naqvi suggests that the death occurred between 7:00 am and 8:00 am. This creates a conflict between the eyewitness accounts and the medical evidence.

Additionally, the prosecution's case is weakened by the fact that the alleged extrajudicial confession of the appellant Raiyet Ali, made while in police custody, is inadmissible as evidence. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has previously ruled that confessions made in police custody are not admissible.

The judge concludes that the prosecution's evidence is full of doubts and that there are several circumstances that create serious doubts about the truthfulness of the prosecution's story. According to precedent, if there is a single circumstance that creates doubt, it is sufficient to give the benefit of doubt to the accused. In this case, there are multiple circumstances that cast doubt on the prosecution's case, and therefore the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused. The text discusses the principle of "benefit of doubt" in criminal law, which states that if there is reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, they are entitled to the benefit of that doubt as a matter of right, not just as a matter of grace or concession. This means that if there is even a single circumstance that creates reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the accused's guilt, they should be acquitted.

The principle is based on the idea that it is better for 10 guilty people to be acquitted than for one innocent person to be convicted. This principle has been reiterated by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in several cases, including Tariq Pervez vs. The State (1995) and Muhammad Akram vs. The State (2009).

In the current case, the judge accepts the appeal of Raiyet Ali, sets aside his conviction and sentence, and acquits him of the charge under Section 302(b) PPC by extending him the benefit of doubt. The judge also dismisses a criminal revision filed by the complainant for enhancement of sentence, as the prosecution evidence was not credible and the accused has been acquitted due to reasonable doubt.
