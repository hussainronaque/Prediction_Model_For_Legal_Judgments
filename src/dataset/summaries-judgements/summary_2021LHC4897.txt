Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

* The Lahore High Court is hearing a criminal appeal (No. 3873-ATA/2015) filed by Yasir Aurangzaib against the State and others.
* The appellant was convicted by the Anti-Terrorism Court-III, Lahore, in 2015 for offences under the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
* The convictions were for possessing explosive substances, including a hand grenade, detonator, and prima cord, with the intention of committing terrorism.
* The appellant was sentenced to 7 years' rigorous imprisonment under the Explosive Substances Act, 14 years' rigorous imprisonment under the Anti-Terrorism Act, and 7 years' simple imprisonment under the Explosive Substances Act. His property was also forfeited to the Government.
* The appellant has appealed against his conviction and sentence, arguing that the case against him is false and concocted by the police.
* The appellant's counsel argues that the appellant was picked up by an agency before the incident and that there is evidence to show that he was missing before the alleged recovery of explosive substances.
* The appellant's counsel also claims that the police story is false and that there is no credible evidence to support the conviction. Here's a summary of the appeal:

The appellant is challenging his conviction and sentence for a crime, arguing that the prosecution's case is flawed and the trial court erred in convicting him. The appellant's lawyers argue that:

* The police framed the appellant by falsely accusing him of being a terrorist to avoid having him in custody.
* There were no independent witnesses to the appellant's arrest, which took place in a busy area (a bus terminal).
* The police did not associate any public witnesses with the arrest, seizure, and recovery proceedings, which is suspicious.
* The appellant had nothing to do with the commission of the offence and the trial court convicted him erroneously.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argues that the trial court's verdict was based on solid evidence and that the appellant's claims are unfounded. They argue that the documents presented by the appellant's lawyers are afterthoughts and were rightly discarded by the trial court.

The appeal court is considering the arguments and has examined the record, including the statements of two key prosecution witnesses (PW-1 and PW-2) who provided conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the appellant's arrest. Here's a summary of the text:

The prosecution's case against the accused has several contradictions and doubts. Two key witnesses, PW-1 and PW-2, testified that they did not surround the bus and that the accused did not try to flee, but the police did not chase the two co-accused who escaped. The witnesses also stated that the recovered articles were examined by experts, but the report contradicts their testimony. The FIR raises many questions, such as why the police couldn't arrest the two co-accused who fled, and how they failed to notice or check the three suspects when they boarded and alighted from the bus. The police also didn't seem concerned about the two escaped suspects who were allegedly carrying explosive substances. Additionally, the court notes that the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances had issued directions for the registration of a case about the appellant's disappearance before the FIR was registered, suggesting that the police may have planted a false case against the appellant to continue his custody. Here's a summary of the text:

The court is reviewing a case where the appellant was arrested and charged with possessing explosive substances. The court is skeptical of the evidence presented and notes several inconsistencies and irregularities in the investigation and FIR (First Information Report). Specifically:

* The raiding party claimed to have no information about the accused, yet the FIR contains detailed information about two other alleged accomplices, suggesting that the appellant and others were already in police custody.
* No effort was made to collect evidence or investigate the whereabouts of the other two alleged accomplices.
* The court believes that the appellant was illegally detained and his custody was concealed from his family, and the false case was registered to justify his detention.

The court cites a previous Supreme Court judgment (2018 SCMR 495) that emphasizes the importance of following strict judicial procedures and safeguards to prevent forced disappearances and illegal detentions. The court concludes that the FIR is false and was fabricated to legalize the appellant's detention, and that the appellant's statement under Section 342, Cr.P.C. (a statement made by the accused in response to allegations) supports this conclusion. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellant, Yasir Aurangzaib, was arrested by police officials, some in uniform and some not, and was accused of a crime. To avoid illegal detention, a case was registered against him, and he was arrested along with his relatives. A FIR (First Information Report) was filed, and the appellant's father submitted an application to the commission of inquiry against forced disappearances. The prosecution failed to prove the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and the court accepted the appellant's statement that he was illegally detained. The court cited several precedents and held that if there is even a single circumstance that creates reasonable doubt about the appellant's guilt, he is entitled to the benefit of doubt as a matter of right. Therefore, the court acquitted the appellant of the charge and ordered his release.
