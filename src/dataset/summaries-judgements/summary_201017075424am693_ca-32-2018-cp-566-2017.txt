Here is a summary of the document:

The document is a court order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad, dated January 11, 2018. The order is related to a criminal petition (No. 566 of 2017) filed by Aziz Ullah against the State. The petition is seeking cancellation of bail granted to respondent No. 1 (Nawas Khan) by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, on May 15, 2017.

The case involves an FIR (First Information Report) No. 868 dated August 30, 2009, which alleges that respondent No. 1 fired a gun at the complainant and his relative Sultan, resulting in Sultan's death.

The Supreme Court had issued notices to the respondent on October 31, 2017, and the case was fixed for arguments on November 17, 2017. However, the respondent failed to appear on several occasions, despite repeated calls and adjournments. As a result, the Supreme Court was forced to issue non-bailable warrants of arrest for the respondent on January 9, 2018.

In the order, the Supreme Court has converted the criminal petition into an appeal and allowed it in the terms stated in the order. The court has directed the Registrar of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, to take further necessary action. The order also requests acknowledgment of receipt of the letter and its enclosure from the Peshawar High Court. Here's a summary of the court document:

* The petitioner (complainant) is challenging a bail granted to respondent No.1 (accused) by the Peshawar High Court in a criminal case.
* The respondent No.1 was nominated in the FIR (First Information Report) for firing at the complainant and a deceased person, Sultan.
* Despite efforts, the respondent No.1's whereabouts could not be traced, and he had switched off his mobile phone and absconded.
* The petitioner's counsel argued that the respondent No.1 did not deserve bail due to the seriousness of the offense, his history of absconding, and his failure to appear before the court despite assurances.
* The state counsel supported the petitioner's contentions.
* The Supreme Court of Pakistan agreed with the petitioner and set aside the bail granted to respondent No.1 by the High Court.
* The non-bailable warrants of arrest against respondent No.1 were upheld, and the court directed that they be issued again to ensure his production before the trial court.

In essence, the Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted to the accused and directed the issuance of non-bailable warrants of arrest to ensure his appearance in court.
