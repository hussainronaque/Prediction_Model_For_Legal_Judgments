**Case Background**

* The appellant (defendant) was arrested on October 7, 2019, and charged with murder (Section 302), hurt (Section 324), and common intention (Section 34) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
* The appellant denied the charges and demanded a trial.

**Prosecution's Case**

* The prosecution presented 15 witnesses, including:
	+ Witnesses to the execution of warrants and proclamation of the appellant
	+ The author of the First Information Report (FIR)
	+ Witnesses to recoveries of evidence, including an iron rod and a pistol
	+ The complainant and eye-witnesses
	+ A doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased
* The prosecution also presented expert reports and other evidence.

**Appellant's Defense**

* The appellant's version is that the case was based on malafide and false implication, and that he was innocent.
* The appellant opted not to provide evidence in his defense, but later produced certain documents related to the trial of his co-accused.

**Arguments**

* The appellant's counsel argued that the prosecution's case was weak due to contradictions between medical and ocular accounts, and that the acquittal of co-accused Rooh-ul-Ameen should also result in the appellant's acquittal.
* The prosecution's counsel argued that the appellant's conduct as an absconder prevented him from demanding acquittal, and that the roles of the acquitted co-accused were different from the appellant's.

**Current Status**

* The case is currently under appeal, with the appellant seeking acquittal due to the prosecution's alleged failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Here's a summary of the court document:

The appellant has been convicted of a crime by the trial court, and the prosecution is arguing that the conviction should be upheld. The prosecution argues that the statement of a witness can be partially believed, and in this case, the medical evidence supports the witness's account of the events. Additionally, the prosecution points out that the recovery of a pistol and the report of the PFSA (Presumably a forensic science agency) also corroborate the witness's account.

The court then discusses the specific details of the case, including the fact that the appellant was accused of making a firing that hit the deceased, while another accused, Rooh-ul-Ameen, was accused of making another firing that hit the deceased's knee. The court notes that Rooh-ul-Ameen was acquitted in a previous trial, and that the acquittal was not overturned on appeal.

The court then examines the statement of a key witness, Hayat Khan, and notes that he had made a supplementary statement to the police, which was not mentioned in his initial statement. The court questions the credibility of Hayat Khan's statement, given that he had made improvements to his statement during the trial, which are not supported by the medical evidence. The court suggests that if Hayat Khan's supplementary statement is not believed, then it raises questions about how the deceased received a second firearm injury on his knee.

Overall, the court is considering whether to uphold the conviction of the appellant, and is evaluating the credibility of the witnesses and the evidence presented in the case. The statement discusses the concept of material improvements in witness testimony and its impact on the credibility of witnesses in criminal cases. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled that when witnesses make deliberate and dishonest improvements to their testimony during trial, they become unreliable and untrustworthy. This is because such improvements are made to bring the prosecution's case in line with medical evidence, and are therefore considered to be false and dishonest.

The court has held that such witnesses cannot be believed, and their testimony is not worthy of reliance. This view is supported by multiple precedents, including cases from 1960, 1963, 1971, 1985, 1993, 2017, and 2019.

In one particular case, the court held that when witnesses make material improvements to their testimony, it is a deliberate attempt to deceive the court and compromise the truth. The court emphasized that truth is the foundation of justice, and any compromise on truth amounts to a compromise on a society's future as a just, fair, and civilized society.

The court has also rejected the principle of "sifting the grain from the chaff," which allows for the acceptance of parts of a witness's testimony while rejecting other parts. Instead, the court has adopted the rule "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus" (false in one thing, false in everything), which means that if a witness is found to be dishonest in one aspect of their testimony, their entire testimony becomes unreliable.

Overall, the statement emphasizes the importance of truth and credibility in witness testimony, and the need for courts to reject deliberate falsehoods in order to ensure justice and maintain public trust in the judicial system. Here is a summary of the text:

The court is ruling that the principle of "falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus" (false in one thing, false in everything) shall henceforth be an integral part of criminal jurisprudence in Pakistan. This means that if a witness is found to have lied about one material aspect, they shall be proceeded against for perjury.

The court is also criticizing the prosecution's handling of a murder case. The post-mortem examination was conducted by Dr. Ghulab Shah, who claimed to have received the dead body at 5:00 pm, but the post-mortem report shows that the examination was conducted at 10:00 pm, with no explanation for the delay. The court cites previous cases where delayed post-mortem examinations have raised suspicions about the police's handling of evidence.

The court also questions the timing of the First Information Report (FIR), which was registered at 5:30 pm, close to the time of the occurrence, but with discrepancies in the statements of witnesses and the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination. The court suggests that the FIR may have been recorded later than claimed.

Additionally, the court is skeptical about the recovery of a pistol from the appellant's house, which was allegedly found in a crockery box. The prosecution failed to prove that the appellant had exclusive possession of the house or knowledge of the place where the pistol was recovered. The summary is:

The court ruled in favor of the appellant, finding that the prosecution's evidence was unreliable, contradictory, and insufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court emphasized that it is the prosecution's burden to prove its case, and that the burden does not shift to the accused. The court cited previous Supreme Court decisions in "Abdul Majeed vs. The State" and "Nasrullah alias Nasro vs. The State" to support its decision. As a result, the appeal was allowed, the impugned judgment was set aside, and the appellant was acquitted of the charge. The appellant, who was in custody, was ordered to be released immediately unless required in another case.
