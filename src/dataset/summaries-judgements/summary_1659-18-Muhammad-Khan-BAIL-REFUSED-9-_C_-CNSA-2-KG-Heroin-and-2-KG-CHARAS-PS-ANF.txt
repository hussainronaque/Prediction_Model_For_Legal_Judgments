Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case Details:**

* Case Number: Cr.M/Bail No: 1659-P of 2018
* Date of Hearing: August 28, 2018
* Petitioner: Muhammad Khan, son of Azeem Khan
* Respondent: State/ANF (Anti-Narcotics Force)

**Case Background:**

* The petitioner was arrested on April 22, 2018, on suspicion of smuggling narcotics from Nowshera to Punjab.
* The ANF received intelligence that a vehicle bearing registration number LIC-579 would be transporting a large quantity of narcotics.
* The vehicle was intercepted, and the driver, Muhammad Khan, and a passenger, Shahzeb, were arrested.
* A search of the vehicle revealed two kilograms of heroin and two kilograms of charas (a type of cannabis) hidden in secret compartments.
* The petitioner was denied bail by the Special Court (CNS) on July 10, 2018, leading to this petition.

**Arguments:**

* The petitioner's counsel argued that Muhammad Khan was innocent and had been falsely implicated, and that as the driver, he had no knowledge of the contraband hidden in the vehicle.
* The ANF's counsel opposed the petition, arguing that the petitioner was liable for the crime since the contraband was found in the vehicle he was driving.

**Judgment:**

* The court rejected the petitioner's bail application, citing the recovery of heroin and charas from the vehicle and the petitioner's role as the driver.
* The court ruled that the driver of a vehicle cannot be absolved of liability if contraband is found in the vehicle, even if it is hidden in secret compartments.

In essence, the court upheld the petitioner's detention and denied his bail application, finding that the evidence suggested he was involved in the smuggling of narcotics. Here is a summary of the text:

The court has rejected a petition for bail from an accused person in a drug-related case. The court cited several previous Supreme Court of Pakistan cases to support its decision. The key points are:

* The chemical examiner's report is sufficient to prove that the substance found in the vehicle was charas and heroin, which can cause intoxication.
* The court cannot consider the maximum sentence for the offence when deciding on bail, and must focus on the likelihood of conviction.
* In cases like this, the court normally avoids granting bail on merits to avoid prejudicing either side.
* The investigation is complete, and the challan (charge sheet) has been submitted, so the trial is likely to commence soon.
* The court finds that there is a prima facie case against the petitioner, which falls under the prohibition contained in Section 497 Cr.PC and Section 51 of the CNSA Act, 1997.
* Therefore, the petitioner is not entitled to bail.
* The prosecution is directed to submit the complete challan within two weeks, and the trial court is directed to conclude the trial expeditiously, within four months.

The petition is dismissed, and the record of the case is to be sent back immediately.
