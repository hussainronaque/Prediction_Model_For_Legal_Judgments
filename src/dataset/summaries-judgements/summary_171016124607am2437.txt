**Appellant's Defense**

* The appellant pleaded not guilty and opted to face trial.
* In his statement under Section 342, Cr.P.C., the appellant denied the allegations of the prosecution, but did not provide any alternative explanation. Here is a summary of the case:

The appellant, Suleman, was found guilty of murder and sexual assault by the trial court and sentenced accordingly. Suleman appealed the conviction, arguing that he was under 18 years old at the time of the offense and therefore should have been tried under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000. He claimed that the trial court failed to hold an inquiry to determine his age, which is a procedural irregularity. Additionally, Suleman's lawyer argued that his confessional statement was obtained under pressure and torture, and that he was not afforded a fair trial.

The State, represented by the Assistant Advocate General, countered that Suleman's confessional statement was corroborated by circumstantial and ocular evidence, and that the trial court's judgment was legally correct. The State also argued that the plea of Suleman's age was never raised before the trial court, and therefore should not be considered now.

The appeals court reviewed the record and found that Suleman's age was inconsistent across different documents, with some indicating he was 18/19 years old, while others showed 18/20 years old or 19 years old. Suleman claims to have been only 17 years old at the time of the offense. The court has to consider these arguments and decide whether to uphold or set aside Suleman's conviction and sentence. Here's a summary of the court document:

The trial court failed to properly determine the age of the accused, who claimed to be a juvenile, and instead relied on a medical board report that was not conclusive proof of age. The court did not summon NADRA officials or school records to clarify the anomaly in the accused's age. This violates Section 7 of the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000, which requires a thorough inquiry, including a medical report, to determine the age of the accused.

The court failed to give the accused a fair trial, partly due to media hype and public pressure, which influenced the court's proceedings. The accused was not provided with a competent counsel, as the lawyers engaged by an NGO were not experts in criminal cases. The court should have engaged a counsel with expertise in criminal law to ensure the accused's right to a fair trial.

The court cites several judgments, including a Supreme Court case, that emphasize the importance of a fair trial and the need for courts to remain impartial and unaffected by public opinion or the heinousness of the offence. Every accused has a constitutional right to a fair trial, and it is the duty of the court to ensure that this right is upheld. Here is a summary of the court document:

The court is reviewing a criminal case where the accused was unrepresented and sentenced to death. The court believes that the accused did not receive a fair trial and that the trial court failed to properly investigate and examine the prosecution's evidence. The court notes that it is the duty of the trial court to ensure a fair trial, especially when the accused is unrepresented.

The court orders a retrial of the case, with the following conditions:

* The Sessions Judge will appoint a counsel for the accused under High Court Rules and Orders.
* The Sessions Judge will conduct an inquiry to determine whether the accused was a juvenile at the time of the offense.
* If the accused is found to be a juvenile, a new trial will be conducted under the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance, 2000.
* If the accused is not found to be a juvenile, the court will re-summon material witnesses to allow the accused to further cross-examine them.
* The accused will be treated as an undertrial prisoner by the court and jail authorities.

The court sets aside the impugned judgment of the trial court and remands the case to the Court of Sessions Judge, Swat at Gulkada for a retrial.
