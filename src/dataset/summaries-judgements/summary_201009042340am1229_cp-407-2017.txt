Here is a summary of the document:

The document appears to be a court order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The case number is Criminal Petition No. 407 of 2017, and it involves a petitioner named Abdul Ghaffar and respondents named Said Umar and another.

The order dismisses the petition, upholding the judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated 16/03/2017 in Crl.A 12-P/2016. The Supreme Court agrees with the High Court that the eyewitnesses produced by the prosecution were doubtful, and their testimony was not reliable.

The order states that the petitioner was not an eyewitness to the occurrence and had been informed about it by his son, Abdullah (PW6), who failed to mention this in his statement to the trial court. Additionally, another eyewitness, Usman Ali (PW5), was not mentioned in the FIR and made his statement to the police eight days after the occurrence.

The Supreme Court concludes that the prosecution's evidence was not reliable and had no independent corroboration, leading to the dismissal of the petition. The order was issued on 23/01/2018, and a certified copy of the order was sent to the Peshawar High Court for information and further necessary action. Here is a summary:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissed a petition challenging a High Court judgment that acquitted someone of a crime. The Court found no reason to interfere with the acquittal and therefore refused leave to appeal.
