* Saqib Ali, along with his co-accused, was tried for the abduction and murder of two children, Muhammad Hashir and Muhammad Ahmed, and disappearance of evidence.
* The trial court acquitted Saqib Ali of the charges related to the abduction and murder of Muhammad Ahmed and disappearance of evidence.

* Muhammad Azam Butt, the complainant, filed a revision petition seeking enhancement of Saqib Ali's sentence from life imprisonment to death (Criminal Revision No. 839 of 2016).

**Judgment**

* The Lahore High Court hasDisposed of both the appeal and revision petition together, as they arise out of the same judgment.
* The judgment is not clear about the outcome of the appeal and revision petition. It appears that the High Court is presenting the facts and background of the case, but the judgment itself is missing. Here is a summary of the case:

* A complaint was filed against the appellant for abducting two minor children, Muhammad Hashir and Muhammad Ahmad, which led to an FIR being registered under section 363 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
* Later, the dead body of an unknown minor was found in a canal, and an FIR was registered under section 302 PPC (murder) against unknown accused persons.
* The dead body was later identified as Muhammad Hashir, and the charges were added to the original FIR.
* The appellant was arrested and charged with the crime, and after trial, was found guilty and sentenced.
* The appellant appealed the conviction, claiming that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated by the complainant and the local police.
* The appellant's counsel argued that the prosecution's evidence, including eyewitness testimony and circumstantial evidence, was weak and should not be relied upon.
* Specifically, the counsel argued that:
	+ The eyewitness who claimed to have seen the appellant throwing the children into the canal only came forward two months after the incident and was not credible.
	+ The circumstantial evidence was weak and did not prove the appellant's guilt.
	+ The dead body of Muhammad Ahmad was not recovered, and the appellant had been acquitted of his abduction and murder.
	+ The postmortem examination of Muhammad Hashir's body showed five injuries, but no weapon was recovered from the appellant.
	+ Other evidence, such as last seen testimony and recovery of clothes, was also not credible.
	+ The prosecution's motive for the crime was not proven.
* The appellant's counsel also pointed out that the trial court had disbelieved the prosecution's evidence against other co-accused in the case, and therefore, the evidence against the appellant should also be disbelieved. Here is a summary of the appeal:

The appellant, Saqib Ali, has appealed his conviction for the abduction and murder of Muhammad Hashir, a minor boy. The defense argues that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that there is no independent corroboration of the evidence against the appellant. Therefore, the appeal should be accepted and the appellant acquitted.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argues that it has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the evidence against the appellant is convincing and reliable. The prosecution points to the testimony of Muhammad Yaqoob, who claimed to have seen the appellant and his co-accused throwing the minor boys into a canal. The prosecution also highlights the evidence of last seen alive, motive, and recovery of last worn clothes and articles of the deceased boys, which were recovered based on the appellant's pointing out.

The complainant has also filed a revision petition, arguing that the appellant was awarded a lesser punishment than deserved and that he should be awarded capital punishment.

The court has heard arguments from both sides and has perused the record. The court notes that the prosecution has presented both ocular and circumstantial evidence in the case. Here's a summary of the case:

The prosecution's key witness, Muhammad Yaqoob (PW.3), claims to have seen the appellant, Saqib Ali, and his co-accused throwing two minor boys into a canal on November 16, 2009. However, there are several inconsistencies in his testimony:

* Muhammad Yaqoob didn't report the incident to the police until January 22, 2010, two months and six days after the alleged crime. No explanation is given for his delay in coming forward.
* He visited the police station the day after the incident for a personal matter, but didn't mention the crime to the police at that time.
* His testimony conflicts with the medical evidence, which suggests that the death of one of the victims, Muhammad Hashir, occurred between November 26 and December 2, 2009, not on November 16, 2009, as claimed by Muhammad Yaqoob.
* Muhammad Yaqoob's testimony also states that he saw the accused throwing "two children" into the canal, not dead bodies, which raises further questions about the accuracy of his account.

The judge is questioning the credibility of Muhammad Yaqoob's testimony and the prosecution's case, highlighting the inconsistencies and lack of plausible explanations for the delays and discrepancies in the evidence. Here's a summary of the text:

A witness, Muhammad Yaqoob, testified that he saw three men, including the appellant, throwing two children into a canal. However, the medical evidence showed that the deceased child, Muhammad Hashir, had five ante-mortem injuries and fractured bones, indicating that he was murdered before being thrown into the canal. This contradicts Muhammad Yaqoob's testimony, which stated that he saw the appellants throwing the children into the canal, not their dead bodies. Therefore, the witness's testimony is unreliable and was correctly disbelieved by the trial court.

The text also discusses the principles of circumstantial evidence, citing various court judgments. It emphasizes that in cases relying on circumstantial evidence, every circumstance must be linked together to form a continuous chain that connects the crime to the accused. If any link in the chain is missing, the benefit of doubt must go to the accused. Here's a summary of the text:

The text discusses the evaluation of circumstantial evidence in a criminal trial. The court cites a previous Supreme Court case, "Altaf Hussain vs. Fakhar Hussain and another" (2008), which held that all pieces of evidence must be linked to form a complete chain, with one end connected to the body of the deceased and the other end connected to the accused. If one link fails, the entire chain is broken.

In the present case, the court examines each piece of circumstantial evidence separately. The prosecution's evidence includes:

1. Last seen evidence
2. Recoveries of last worn clothes and other articles
3. Pointation of the place of occurrence by the appellant
4. Motive
5. Medical evidence

The court starts by evaluating the last seen evidence, which was not mentioned in the FIR. The complainant did not accuse the appellant of taking away his sons from his house. Instead, the complainant claimed that the appellant came to his house, played with his sons, and left, and later, his sons disappeared. The prosecution's last seen evidence comes from two witnesses, Roheel Ahmad and Atif Mehmood, who claimed to have seen the appellant with one of the minor sons. However, the cross-examination of Roheel Ahmad was incomplete due to his absence, and the court notes that his statement is inadmissible as evidence because it was not subjected to cross-examination. Here is a summary of the text:

The case involves Roheel Ahmad, PW.11, and Atif Mehmood, PW.12, who is a prosecution witness. Atif Mehmood testified that he saw the appellant, Saqib Ali, with a minor boy, Muhammad Hashir (who later died), on November 16, 2009, but didn't make a statement to the police until January 2, 2010, a delay of one month and 17 days. The defense argues that this delay is significant and that Atif Mehmood's testimony is unreliable.

Additionally, Atif Mehmood had previously signed an affidavit on November 19, 2009, stating that Saqib Ali was innocent and that the complainant, Muhammad Azam Butt, had falsely accused him of abducting his sons. Atif Mehmood later claimed that he was pressured into signing the affidavit by local leaders, but the fact remains that he knew about the incident on November 19, 2009, but didn't make a statement to the police until January 2, 2010.

The defense also argues that Atif Mehmood was coerced into giving false testimony against the appellant due to the influence of the complainant, Muhammad Azam Butt, who is a journalist. Atif Mehmood conceded during cross-examination that he was in police custody and being interrogated on the day he made his statement to the police. Here is a summary of the statement:

* The witness, Atif Mehmood (PW.12), was interrogated as a suspect in the same case and was in police custody when he made a statement against the appellant on January 2, 2010. Therefore, the court finds it unsafe to rely on his evidence.
* The prosecution's evidence of recoveries of last worn clothes and other articles of the deceased is also questioned. The witness, Abdul Basit (PW.4), recovered clothes and articles on the pointation of the appellant, Saqib Ali, but none of the recovered items were stained with blood, which is unusual given the severity of the injuries on the deceased's body.
* Additionally, the recovery of clothes and articles allegedly belonging to Muhammad Ahmad, deceased, is of no value to the prosecution since the appellant was acquitted of abduction and murder charges related to Muhammad Ahmad.
* The recovery of shoes and a feeder belonging to Muhammad Hashir, deceased, is also inconsequential because they were not mentioned in the complainant's original complaint, and the recovery witness did not mention recovering the clothes described in the complaint.

The court is ultimately questioning the reliability of the prosecution's evidence and recoveries in the case. Here is a summary of the text:

The appeal is discussing the prosecution's evidence in a murder case and highlighting its flaws. The points discussed are:

* The recovery of last worn clothes and articles of the deceased from the accused's pointation is not sufficient evidence to convict.
* The pointation of the place of occurrence by the accused did not yield any incriminating material.
* The prosecution's motive of the crime, that the accused posed as a fake 'Peer' (Saint) and enticed the complainant's family members, is not proven. The complainant was the one who forbade the accused from doing so, but there is no evidence that the minor children, who were the victims, ever forbade the accused.
* The medical evidence shows that the injuries on the body of one of the victims, Muhammad Hashir, were ante-mortem and sufficient to cause death, but the time of death was estimated to be between 26.11.2009 to 02.12.2009, which is not consistent with the prosecution's case.

Overall, the appeal is arguing that the prosecution's evidence is weak and insufficient to convict the accused. Here is a summary of the text:

The court is discussing a murder case where the deceased, Hashir, was killed by blunt means. The prosecution's case is based on the testimony of Muhammad Yaqoob (PW.3), but the medical evidence contradicts his account. The medical officer's opinion is that the injuries were caused by blunt means, but no weapon was found on the accused. The court notes that medical evidence can provide information on the time of death, type of injuries, and type of weapon used, but it cannot identify the assailant.

The court concludes that the prosecution's evidence is "full of doubts" and that there are several circumstances that create reasonable doubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution's story. The court cites several Supreme Court judgments, including Tarig Pervez v. The State, Muhammad Akram v. The State, and Muhammad Mansha v. The State, which establish that if there is even a single circumstance that creates reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt as a matter of right, not as a matter of grace and concession.

The court ultimately decides that the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt and that the prosecution's case is not reliable. The judge has accepted the appeal of Saqib Ali, who was convicted of murder and kidnapping, and has set aside his conviction and sentence. The judge has acquitted Saqib Ali of all charges, citing the principle that "it is better that ten guilty persons be acquitted rather than one innocent person be convicted". The judge has also dismissed a revision petition filed by the complainant, Muhammad Azam Butt, seeking enhancement of Saqib Ali's sentence from life imprisonment to death. Saqib Ali is to be released from custody immediately, unless he is required in another case.
