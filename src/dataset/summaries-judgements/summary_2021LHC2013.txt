Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case details:**

* Case No. HCJDA-38/Criminal Appeal No. 05 of 2021
* Appellant: Mst. Zainab Bibi alias Gudo
* Respondent: The State
* Heard on: 22.06.2021

**Case background:**

* Mst. Zainab Bibi was accused of possessing 2100 grams of Charas (cannabis) and was convicted under Section 9(C) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997.
* She was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000.
* She appealed against the conviction and sentence.

**Facts of the case:**

* On 12.07.2020, a police party stopped an old lady (Mst. Zainab Bibi) in Mohallah Chah Sultan, Rawalpindi, who was carrying a shopping bag containing Charas.
* The Charas was recovered and sent for chemical analysis.
* The police filed a report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. and charged Mst. Zainab Bibi under Section 9-C of the Act.
* She pleaded not guilty and was tried by the learned Additional Sessions Judge/Judge Special Court CNS, Rawalpindi.

**Appellant's argument:**

* The appellant's counsel argued that during her examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C., the report of the chemical examiner was not put to her, which is a defect that cannot be cured under the law.
* Therefore, she is entitled to acquittal on this ground alone.

**State's response:**

* The State's counsel argued that the point raised by the appellant is technical in nature and does not affect the conviction recorded by the trial court.

**Court's decision:**

* The court heard both sides and is expected to deliver a judgment on the appeal. Here's a summary of the text:

* The court has the power to question the accused at any stage of the trial to enable them to explain any circumstances appearing against them in the evidence.
* This is not just a formality, but a mandate to allow the accused to respond to any evidence that may be used against them.
* The court must put all pieces of evidence, including documentary evidence, to the accused to allow them to respond.
* This is based on the principle of "Audi Alteram Partem", which means "no one should be condemned unheard".
* Failure to do so may render the conviction invalid.
* The Supreme Court of Pakistan has emphasized the importance of examining the accused under Section 342 of the CrPC, and has held that if incriminating evidence is not put to the accused, it cannot be used against them.
* In the present case, the trial court failed to put a crucial piece of evidence (the PFSA report) to the accused, which may have caused prejudice to the accused.

In essence, the court is emphasizing the importance of fulfilling its duty to examine the accused and put all relevant evidence to them, in order to ensure a fair trial and prevent unjust convictions. Here is a summary of the text:

The court has allowed the criminal appeal and set aside the previous judgment (dated 19.12.2020) due to omission of crucial evidence, which has led to a miscarriage of justice. As a result, the appellant is acquitted of the case and is to be released from custody immediately, unless required in another case.
