* Respondents: National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and others
* Originating from: Peshawar High Court, Peshawar
* Date of judgment: 12.05.2017

**Case Summary**

The petitioners, Syed Ijaz Hussain Shah and Muhammad Saeed, are facing charges of corruption and corrupt practices under the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) 1999. They are accused of cheating people by selling fake land ownership documents and fraudulently receiving Rs.109.55 million. The trial has started, but the petitioners argue that one of the co-accused, Col. (R) Muhammad Ajmal, was made an approver, while three others who played a more active role were granted bail.

**Court Directions**

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has converted the civil petitions into appeals and allowed them, directing the NAB to complete the investigation against the petitioners and all others involved, including local revenue department officials, and forward the report to the Accountability Court within 30 days.

**Letter**

The registrar of the Supreme Court of Pakistan has forwarded a certified copy of the judgment to the Peshawar High Court, inviting attention to the court's directions for immediate compliance and requesting acknowledgement of receipt. Here is a summary of the document:

The Accountability Court was directed to conclude a trial within three months, or else the petitioners would be released on bail if they furnished a bond of Rs. 50 lakhs (5 million) each with two sureties. The petitioners, who have been behind bars for a long time, argued that they should be granted bail since the ring leader of the case had already been granted bail due to delays in the trial, and 70 witnesses still needed to be examined, which would likely take over a year. The NAB (National Accountability Bureau) representative did not dispute this claim, and a review petition against an earlier order of the court had also been dismissed. Therefore, the petitioners were granted bail on the grounds of delay in the trial, with the conditions that they deposit their original passports with the trial court and furnish a bond of Rs. 50 lakhs each with two sureties.
