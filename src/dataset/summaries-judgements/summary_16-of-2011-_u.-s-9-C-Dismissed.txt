Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

**Case Details**

* Case Number: Cr.A No. 16-A/2011
* Date of Hearing: 23.06.2020
* Appellant (State) represented by Raja Muhammad Zubair, Advocate
* Respondent (Javed Iqbal) represented by Fazal-e-Haq Abbasi, Advocate

**Background**

* The State is appealing against the acquittal of Javed Iqbal by the learned Judge Special Court, Abbottabad on 22.04.2010 in a criminal case under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotics Substances Act, 1997.
* The case was registered at Police Station Mirpur, Abbottabad on 18.01.2008 based on a report by Abdul Hafeez ASI.

**Prosecution Story**

* The prosecution alleges that Javed Iqbal was involved in the business of charas and was caught with a large quantity of contraband on 18.01.2008.
* The police received information that Javed Iqbal would be carrying a large quantity of contraband to his guest house and set up a barricade. When Javed Iqbal arrived, he was searched and found to be carrying a shopping bag containing five packets of charas, each containing 13 slabs.
* The recovered charas weighed 5200 grams, and 4 grams from each packet were sent for chemical analysis. Various other items, including a mobile phone, CNIC, phone diary, keys, visiting cards, and cash, were also recovered from Javed Iqbal's personal search.

**Investigation**

* The investigation was conducted by Gulzar Khan SI, who produced the accused before the Illaqa Magistrate and obtained a one-day police custody. The investigation included recording statements of witnesses and submitting a challan against the accused.
* Shamrez constable was a marginal witness to the recovery memo, and Abdul Hafeez ASI was the seizing officer who deposed about the recovery of contraband from Javed Iqbal's personal possession. Here is a summary of the document:

A police officer, PW-4, conducted a search and seized various items, including charas (a controlled substance), shopping bags, and newspaper, from the accused, Javed Iqbal. The officer prepared a recovery memo, drafted a murasila (a document used to send evidence to a forensic lab), and sent the case property to the police station for registration of a First Information Report (FIR). The seized items were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for analysis.

The accused was tried and acquitted by the trial court, leading the State to file an appeal against the acquittal. The appeal is based on the grounds that the evidence requires reappraisal. The appellate court has heard arguments from both the prosecution and the defense and has reviewed the record.

The court notes that when dealing with an appeal against acquittal, it must consider certain principles, including:

* The views of the trial judge on the credibility of witnesses
* The presumption of innocence in favor of the accused
* The reluctance of the appellate court to disturb the findings of fact made by the trial judge
* The importance of giving the benefit of every doubt to the accused person

The court will examine the evidence and the trial court's findings to determine whether the acquittal should be upheld or set aside. Here is a summary of the text:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has established guidelines for reversing acquittals in criminal cases. These principles are:

1. The Supreme Court will not ordinarily interfere with an acquittal and will give weight to the findings of the lower court, unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
2. An acquittal carries two presumptions: that the accused is innocent until proven guilty, and that the lower court has confirmed this assumption of innocence.
3. However, if the lower court has disregarded material evidence, misread evidence, or received evidence illegally, the acquittal may be set aside.
4. The Supreme Court will not interfere with an acquittal simply because it disagrees with the lower court's conclusion, unless the conclusion is impossible or unreasonable.
5. The court will only interfere in exceptional cases where there is overwhelming proof of guilt and a grave miscarriage of justice would occur if the acquittal is allowed to stand.

These principles have been established through various cases, including Abdul Majid vs. Superintendent Remembrance of Legal Affairs, Government of Pakistan, State vs. Anwar Saifullah Khan, and Ghulam Sikandar vs. Mamrez Khan.

The text then goes on to apply these principles to a specific case, involving a prosecution for narcotics offenses. Here's a summary of the text:

The police received a tip that a man, Javed Iqbal, would be selling a large quantity of chars (a type of drug) at his guest house. The police, along with some officials, set up a sting operation and caught Javed Iqbal with a shopping bag containing five packets of chars. Each packet had 13 cakes of chars, and 4 grams of chars were taken from each packet for chemical analysis. However, the defense is arguing that there are several inconsistencies and defects in the prosecution's case, including:

* The samples were not taken from each individual cake or piece of chars, which raises doubts about the quantity collected.
* There was a delay of five days between the recovery of the chars and the submission of the samples to the forensic laboratory, which could have compromised the chain of custody.
* The police did not produce a copy of the roznamcha (daily diary) entry showing that they had left the police station for patrolling, which is essential to establish the genuineness of the prosecution story.
* The prosecution's case relies heavily on the testimony of the police officials, but their credibility is in question due to these inconsistencies.

The defense is arguing that these defects in the prosecution's case raise serious doubts about the veracity of the evidence and that the benefit of the doubt should go to the accused. Here is a summary of the text:

The prosecution appealed a court's decision to acquit an accused person, Javed Iqbal. However, the appeals court found that the prosecution failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for a discrepancy in the evidence, specifically why the recovery officer used someone else's monogram ("WK") on the sealed parcels of recovered substance instead of their own. As a result, the appeals court dismissed the prosecution's appeal, upholding the acquittal of Javed Iqbal.
