Here is a summary of the court judgment:

**Case:** The State vs. Safir Ullah, Criminal Appeal No. 15-P/2016 in the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, Judicial Department.

**Background:** The accused, Safir Ullah, was acquitted by the Special Court (CNS), Peshawar, on December 12, 2015, in a case related to the possession of 72 kg of narcotics (chars) in a vehicle. The State filed an appeal against the acquittal.

**Facts:** On January 31, 2015, the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) set up a checkpoint in Hayatabad, Peshawar, based on prior information about a vehicle smuggling narcotics from tribal territory to Punjab. The vehicle was stopped, and the driver, Safir Ullah, was arrested. A search of the vehicle revealed 60 packets of chars, which were seized as evidence.

**Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution produced four witnesses, including the investigating officer, to prove the accused's guilt. The accused denied the charges and claimed to have been falsely implicated.

**Trial Court's Judgment:** The trial court acquitted the accused, citing material contradictions in the prosecution's evidence, which created reasonable doubt.

**Appeal:** The State appealed against the acquittal, arguing that the prosecution had produced sufficient evidence to prove the accused's guilt. The accused did not appear in court, despite being summoned multiple times.

**High Court's Judgment:** The High Court upheld the trial court's acquittal, finding that there were material contradictions in the prosecution's evidence, which created reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the acquittal was justified, and the appeal was dismissed. Here is a summary of the case:

The complainant testified that a vehicle was stopped and searched at 2000 hours, and narcotics were found. However, the complainant's testimony was contradicted by another witness, Riaz Gul, who stated that the vehicle was driven by Zubair, but then later stated that Zubair drove both the official police vehicle and the case property car, which is not possible.

The complainant also stated that no local police arrived at the scene, but this was contradicted by Fida Muhammad, a police officer who testified that he was present at the scene and saw the narcotics police take the vehicle and its contents into custody.

The accused, in his statement, denied any involvement in the crime and claimed that he was falsely implicated. He stated that he was stopped by two men, one of whom he recognized as a member of the Khasadar force, and was taken to a room where he was demanded to pay a ransom. He claimed that he was later taken to the ANF police station and falsely accused of possessing narcotics.

The evidence presented by the prosecution has some discrepancies, and the statement of the accused, coupled with the testimony of the defense witness, raises the possibility that the accused was falsely implicated in the case. Additionally, the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) is positive, but lacks necessary protocol, which raises further doubts about the case. Here's a summary of the report:

The Chemical Expert's conclusion that the samples contained Chars is not reliable because the report does not specify the tests conducted or their results, which is a mandatory requirement under Rule 6. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has previously ruled in similar cases (Khair-ul-Bashar v. the State and Qaiser Javed Khan v. The State) that a Government Analyst's report must specify:

1. All tests and analysis of the alleged drug
2. The result of each test carried out along with the consolidated result
3. The name of all protocols applied to carry out these tests

Since the report in this case does not meet these requirements, it is not safe to rely on it, and the acquittal of the accused is maintained. The appeal is dismissed.
