The appellant, Ghaffar alias Kali, is appealing a judgment against him for allegedly committing rape and robbery. The defense counsel argues that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the appeal should be accepted and the appellant acquitted. The counsel cites three previous judgments in support of their argument.

On the other hand, the prosecution argues that they have proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the evidence from prosecution witnesses is trustworthy and reliable. The medical evidence shows that the hymen of the victim, Mst. Zubaida Bibi, was ruptured, and the appellant has not established any malicious intent on the part of the prosecution witnesses.

The appeal is based on a case where the appellant was not named in the initial FIR, but was later implicated based on a statement from the alleged abductee, Mst. Zubaida Bibi. The appellant, along with three others, was accused of committing rape and robbery. However, three of the accused were acquitted, and the others were declared proclaimed offenders and not tried in the case. The appeal is being heard, and the judge has noted that no physical evidence, such as a motorcycle, car, or weapon, was recovered from the appellant. Here's a summary of the text:

The appellant, Ghaffar alias Kali, was convicted and sentenced by the trial court despite some discrepancies in the case. The prosecution failed to produce a DNA test report, and a crucial piece of evidence was recovered from the appellant's possession. Moreover, the appellant's right to cross-examine the alleged victim, Mst. Zubaida Bibi, and other prosecution witnesses was closed due to a misunderstanding about the appointment of counsel.

The record shows that the appellant's counsel, Ch. Muhammad Sajid Wains Advocate, submitted a power of attorney on behalf of the appellant, but later made a statement that he did not want to cross-examine certain prosecution witnesses. The counsel was absent on other dates due to a lawyers' strike, and the right of cross-examination was reserved for the appellant.

However, the trial court closed the right of cross-examination for the appellant on multiple occasions, citing the reason that the appellant had not appointed a counsel. This was despite the fact that the power of attorney submitted earlier showed that Ch. Muhammad Sajid Wains Advocate was appointed as counsel on behalf of the appellant. The appellant's counsel argues that the trial court erred in closing the right of cross-examination, which was a crucial aspect of the case. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellant, Zulfigar, was accused of a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment. During the trial, his right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses was closed because he had not yet appointed a lawyer. However, according to the High Court Rules and Orders, if an accused cannot afford a lawyer, the Sessions Judge should appoint one at government expense. This rule was not followed, and the trial was conducted in violation of this rule. The appellant was not provided with a lawyer to cross-examine witnesses, which is a valuable right of the accused. The Supreme Court has held that cross-examination is necessary to test the credibility of witnesses, and that even cross-examination conducted by the accused themselves is not a substitute for cross-examination by a lawyer. The trial court's decision to close the appellant's right to cross-examine witnesses without providing him with a lawyer was unjust and may have led to an unfair outcome. The summary is as follows:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has repeatedly held that it is the duty of the trial court to ensure that the accused has a fair opportunity to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, either through a counsel provided at state expenses or by the accused themselves. If the accused's counsel is unable to perform their duties, the court should provide an alternative arrangement, such as appointing a new counsel or giving the accused the opportunity to hire a new counsel.

In several cases, including Abdul Ghafoor Vs. The State (2011) and Syed Saeed Muhammad Shah and another Vs. The State (1993), the Supreme Court has set aside judgments and remitted cases to the trial court, citing the failure of the trial court to provide a fair opportunity for cross-examination. In one case, the trial court had asked the accused to cross-examine witnesses himself, which was deemed to be a miscarriage of justice.

In the present case, the appeal is allowed, and the impugned judgment is set aside. The case is remanded to the trial court, with instructions to provide the accused with an opportunity to hire a private counsel or choose a defence counsel from a list maintained by the Sessions Judge. The accused will be given three opportunities to cross-examine prosecution witnesses. This is a court judgment that states:

* The appeal is allowed, and the case is sent back to the trial court (Crl. Appeal No.615-J of 2014)
* The trial court must decide the case within 30 days of receiving the attested copy of this judgment
* The trial court must decide the case on its own merits, without being influenced by any observations made by the current court or the previous court (learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chunian)

In essence, the case is being retried, and the trial court is instructed to make a fresh decision without being swayed by any previous judgments.
