The judgment does not specify the final outcome of the appeals, but it provides the background and context of the case. Here is a summary of the text:

A group of people, including the complainant, his wife, and son, were on their way to a meeting to resolve a dispute when they were intercepted by a group of armed men, including Muhammad Asif, Javed, Nazeer, Arshad, Maqbool, Mustafa, and others. One of the accused, Muhammad Asif, shot and killed the complainant's son, Muhammad Nazeer, with a rifle. The motive behind the killing was that the accused persons had previously kidnapped Riffat Bibi and suspected that the complainant's party would take her back and harm them.

The complainant witnessed the occurrence, along with other witnesses, and reported the incident to the police. An FIR was registered, and an investigation was conducted, during which the police collected evidence, including blood-stained earth and empty cartridges, and prepared an inquest report. The dead body was sent to the mortuary for autopsy.

The accused persons were arrested and charged with murder, and the case was registered as Murder Reference No. 33/2016. Here is a summary of the text:

The case involves a murder investigation where the accused was found guilty and subsequently appealed. The investigation revealed the following evidence:

* Cartridges and bullets of .12-bore and .44-bore guns were recovered from the crime scene.
* A rifle .44-bore and live bullets were recovered from the appellant during interrogation.
* A scaled site plan of the crime scene was prepared by a draftsman.
* The post-mortem examination of the deceased revealed two firearm wounds, which were the cause of death.
* Nineteen prosecution witnesses were produced, including ocular witnesses who claimed to have seen the appellant at the crime scene.
* The investigation was conducted by several police officers, who collected evidence and recorded statements.
* The accused denied all allegations and did not opt to present any defense evidence.

The trial court found the accused guilty and subsequently, the accused appealed the decision. Here is a summary of the deposition and the arguments made by the defense and prosecution:

**Deposition:** The appellant claims that the prosecution witnesses (PWs) are close relatives of the complainant and deceased, and have falsely accused him of murder by twisting the real facts.

**Trial Court's Decision:** The trial court found the prosecution's version of events to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, resulting in the appellant's conviction.

**Defense Argument:**

* The trial court's judgment was recorded in a slipshod manner, ignoring real facts and material evidence.
* The prosecution's story is implausible and doesn't appeal to reason.
* Prosecution witnesses changed their stories during trial, and their ocular account is inconsistent with medical evidence.
* Most of the prosecution's version was found to be false during investigation, and other accused were acquitted on the same evidence.
* The motorcycle, a key piece of evidence, was not taken into possession by the investigating officer.
* The motive behind the crime was not substantiated.
* The recovery of the rifle from the appellant was not properly documented, and the forensic report is of no legal consequence.

**Prosecution Response:**

* The occurrence was well-lit, and the parties were known to each other, so there is no possibility of mistaken identity.
* Prosecution witnesses corroborated the prosecution's version of events and withstood cross-examination.
* Medical evidence supports the ocular account.
* The appellant became a fugitive after the crime and was later arrested, leading to the recovery of the rifle.
* The prosecution's case is strong, and the conviction and sentence should stand. Here's a summary of the document:

The document appears to be a court judgment or opinion, and it summarizes the arguments made by counsel for the appellant and respondent in three related criminal cases. The main points are:

* The appellant was convicted of murder and the prosecution argued that the conviction was correct because the appellant had a strong motive, was found guilty during the investigation, and was convicted based on reliable and confidence-inspiring evidence.
* The counsel for the appellant argued that the trial court erred in convicting the appellant and that the prosecution's evidence was not sufficient to prove guilt.
* In a related appeal, the counsel argued that the trial court erred in acquitting certain respondents who were also involved in the murder.
* In a revision petition, the counsel argued that the compensation awarded to the victim's family should be enhanced due to the severity of the crime.

The court notes that each criminal case has its own unique facts and circumstances, and it is the court's duty to ascertain the truthfulness of the prosecution's story. The court reviews the evidence presented, including eyewitness accounts, motive, medical evidence, and investigative evidence, and concludes that it will make a decision based on the entire record. Here's a summary of the text:

In a murder case, the prosecution's witnesses (including the complainant, Muhammad Khan) initially stated that the accused persons, including Qari son of Siddique, intercepted them at an agricultural land and fired shots, resulting in the death of Nazeer Ahmed. However, during the trial, the witnesses changed their statements, saying that they went to a different location (the dera of Ameer) where the accused party didn't show up, and then went to another location where the altercation and firing took place. The witnesses also made material improvements to their statements, which contradicted their initial statements. The court notes that this undermines the credibility of the witnesses and the prosecution's case, citing principles of law that hold that statements improved during trial are not reliable and create doubt about their veracity and credibility. The document appears to be a legal brief summarizing the prosecution's case against an appellant accused of murder. The main arguments presented are:

1. Inconsistencies in the prosecution's version of events, including the time of the alleged occurrence and the identification of the assailants by witnesses in the light of motorcycle headlights, which were not retained as evidence.
2. Failure to follow proper procedure, as the investigating officer did not take into possession the means of transportation and light used for identification, as required by superior court decisions.
3. Medical evidence is incomplete and inconsistent, with the post-mortem examination not providing a specific duration between death and examination, and medical evidence not linking the accused to the crime.
4. The motive for the crime, allegedly a fear of the complainant party not taking back a woman who had contracted marriage with the appellant, is not supported by evidence and seems implausible.
5. The recovery of a rifle allegedly used in the crime and a positive report from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency are not sufficient to prove the appellant's guilt, especially in light of the other inconsistencies and weaknesses in the prosecution's case.

The brief cites several superior court decisions, including Bashir Ahmed alias Mannu vs. The State (1996) and Nazeer Ahmad vs. Gehne Khan and others (2011), to support its arguments. The text is a legal document that argues for the acquittal of an appellant in a murder case. The main points are:

1. The report against the appellant is legally worthless because it was filed on the same day as the incident, which casts doubt on its credibility.
2. The appellant's abscondment after the incident is not proof of guilt, as established by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a previous case.
3. The fact that other accused individuals were acquitted based on the same evidence raises questions about the credibility of the evidence against the appellant.
4. The prosecution's case is riddled with discrepancies and lacks strong corroboration, which further undermines its credibility.
5. In such cases, the court should extend the benefit of doubt to the accused, as a matter of right, not grace.
6. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has established in previous cases that even a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt is sufficient to grant the benefit of doubt to the accused.

Overall, the document argues that the prosecution's case is weak and that the appellant should be acquitted due to the lack of credible evidence and the presence of reasonable doubt. Here is a summary of the court's decision:

* The appellant's conviction and sentence were set aside, and they were acquitted of the charges due to lack of evidence.
* The court emphasized the importance of not convicting an innocent person, even if it means letting 100 guilty people go free.
* The death sentence imposed on Muhammad Asif was not confirmed, and he will not be put to death.
* The appeals and revisions filed against the acquittal of several other individuals were dismissed, as the prosecution's story was disbelieved.
* The appellant (Muhammad Asif) is directed to be released immediately, unless they are required in another case.

In essence, the court has overturned the convictions and death sentences, and has handed down acquittals to the appellants, citing a lack of evidence and the importance of protecting the innocent.
