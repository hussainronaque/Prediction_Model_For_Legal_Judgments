Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

The Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, is hearing a criminal appeal filed by Aqib Javed and three others against their conviction by the Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1 Rawalpindi. The appellants were found guilty of abducting Shahbaz Hussain, son of Mushtaq Hussain, on August 20, 2019, and demanding a ransom of Rs. 500,000. The appellants were convicted under Section 365-A PPC (kidnapping for ransom) and Section 7-E of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The facts of the case are that Mushtaq Hussain reported his son's abduction to the police, and after a ransom was paid, Shahbaz Hussain was released. The police then arrested the appellants and recovered the ransom money. The appellants are challenging their convictions through this appeal.

The judgment sheet does not provide the outcome of the appeal, but rather sets out the facts of the case and the arguments presented by the appellants and the State. Here is a summary of the document:

The document appears to be an appeal case related to a kidnapping for ransom incident. The appellants, Bilal Ali and others, were arrested on August 26, 2019, and identified in an identification parade on August 28, 2019. The prosecution claims that the appellants kidnapped Shahbaz Hussain and demanded a ransom of Rs. 100,000, which was paid by the victim's family. The appellants were arrested and a report was submitted to the court. The prosecution produced several witnesses, including the victim, who identified the appellants, and police officials who recovered the ransom amount and weapons from the appellants.

The appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed that they were falsely implicated in the case. Their counsel argued that the prosecution's case had several lacunas and contradictions, and that the police investigation was faulty. The counsel for the complainant and the prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the case was serious and heinous, and that the prosecution had successfully proved its case during the trial.

The appeal is against the conviction of the appellants under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and the Act. The appellants are seeking to have their conviction overturned, while the prosecution is seeking to have the appeal dismissed. The text appears to be a legal document discussing a criminal case involving kidnapping and ransom payment. Here's a summary of the main points:

* The prosecution's story is being questioned due to inconsistencies and suspicious circumstances surrounding the payment of ransom and the subsequent arrest of the accused.
* Two witnesses, Hussain (Pw-7) and Muhammad Jawwad Anwar Inspector (Pw-10), testified that police officials were present during the ransom payment, but no effort was made to apprehend the culprits.
* The police officials were stationed at various points, including behind hills and in nearby villages, but failed to intercept the accused despite having prior information.
* Inspector Muhammad Jawwad Anwar stated that a large number of police officials were present, but none of them attempted to apprehend the accused.
* The issue of who arranged the ransom amount is unclear, with different versions provided by different witnesses.
* The police officials had marked the currency notes to be used as ransom, but when the accused were arrested, none of the recovered notes had any specific marks.
* The prosecution's story is questionable because the accused were not apprehended when they had the opportunity, but were instead arrested 12 hours later on spy information.

Overall, the document suggests that the prosecution's case is weak and plagued by inconsistencies, casting doubt on the credibility of the witnesses and the police officials involved. Here's a summary of the text:

The prosecution's case against the appellants (Muhammad Sadiq, Aqib Javed, and Amjad Ali) is weakened by several inconsistencies and questionable recoveries of evidence. Specifically:

* The recovery of currency notes from the appellants' possession cannot be linked to the ransom money, as there are no special circumstances to prove otherwise.
* The recoveries of pistols and currency notes from the appellants' homes or hiding places are suspect because crucial evidence like boxes, locks, and keys were not seized by the investigating officer.
* The ownership and access to the properties where the recoveries were made are also unclear.
* The prosecution failed to connect the recovered currency notes to the ransom money, despite having the opportunity to do so through mobile phone records.
* The statement of Syed Hammad Abid DPO (Cw-1) is also questionable, as he gave conflicting accounts of the incident during his examination-in-chief and cross-examination. He also expressed uncertainty about the authenticity of a video clip that could be damaging to his testimony.

Overall, the prosecution's case appears to be flawed and lacks convincing evidence to prove the appellants' guilt. Here is a summary of the text:

A witness, Hammad Abid, testified in court and claimed that a video presented as evidence was edited, out of context, and not authentic. He also stated that he was not summoned to verify the contents of the video at the PFSA (Punjab Forensic Science Agency) in Lahore. However, during cross-examination, several inconsistencies and contradictions were revealed, including:

* The CD presented contains the voice and picture of Hammad Abid
* The time of his arrival at the site was disputed
* The ransom money was arranged by the police and recovered from the accused
* There was a cross-firing between the police party and the accused

The court is skeptical of the witness's testimony and believes that the facts presented are mysterious and full of doubts. Additionally, the court notes that the identification parade, which is a procedure to test the veracity of an eyewitness's testimony, was not conducted properly. The rules and procedures for holding an identification parade were not followed, which raises concerns about the reliability of the evidence presented. Here's a summary of the text:

A magistrate was supposed to conduct an identification parade for three appellants (Aqib Javed, Muhammad Sadiq, and Amjad Ali) by arranging three queues, where each appellant would stand in a line with other people, and witnesses would be called one by one to identify them. Instead, the magistrate conducted three separate identification parades for each appellant, with identical procedures, and without ensuring that witnesses did not communicate with each other. Additionally, the magistrate did not follow proper procedures, such as keeping witnesses separate after they had identified the appellants, and did not offer the appellants the opportunity to change their positions in the lineup. The identification parade for one of the appellants, Bilal Ali, was also flawed as the "dummies" (people standing in the lineup with the appellant) were not of similar features and were of different ages. Furthermore, the magistrate did not properly prove electronic evidence, such as call data records, in accordance with the law. Overall, the identification parade and evidentiary procedures were marred by numerous errors and omissions, which raises serious doubts about the reliability of the evidence. Here is a summary of the judgment:

The court ruled in favor of the appellants (Aqib Javed, Muhammad Sadiq, Amjad Ali, and Bilal Ali) and set aside the impugned judgment of the trial court. The prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly with regards to the Call Data Record (CDR) evidence (Ex.PT/1 to Ex.PT/5). The court noted that:

* The prosecution did not produce the concerned official from the cellular company who issued the CDR.
* The CDRs did not have the signature and stamp of the issuing authority.

The court emphasized that the prosecution must prove its case at all stages of the trial and cannot take advantage of the defense's weaknesses. The court also reiterated that the benefit of doubt must be given to the accused, not as a concession, but as a privilege. Therefore, the appellants were acquitted and directed to be released from custody forthwith if not required in any other case.
