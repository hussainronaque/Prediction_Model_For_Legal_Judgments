This is a court document from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The document is a certified copy of an order/judgment dated February 20, 2018, in a criminal petition (Case No. 1125 of 2017). Here's a summary of the case:

* The petitioner, Zair Ullah, appealed against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, which acquitted the respondent, Shehiryar, in a murder case (FIR No. 146/2000 dated 12/03/2000).
* The Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Dost Muhammad Khan, and Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the appeal on February 20, 2018.
* The court dismissed the petition and refused leave to appeal, upholding the High Court's judgment.
* The court cited several reasons for its decision, including:
	+ The eyewitnesses' statements were inconsistent and lacked corroboration.
	+ The injured eyewitness, Mst. Taj Mohallah, was not produced during the trial, and her earlier statement did not implicate the respondent.
	+ The eyewitnesses produced by the prosecution were from different places, and no independent proof was adduced to establish their presence at the crime scene.
	+ The medical evidence contradicted the eyewitnesses' statements in several ways.
	+ The FIR was registered after a preliminary investigation, which reduced its credibility.
	+ The respondent's alleged abscondance was not established in a lawful manner.

The document also includes a letter from the Registrar of the Supreme Court to the Registrar of the Peshawar High Court, forwarding a certified copy of the order/judgment for information and further necessary action.
