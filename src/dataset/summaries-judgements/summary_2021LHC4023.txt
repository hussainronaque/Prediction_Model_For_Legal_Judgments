The summary does not indicate the outcome of the appeal, i.e., whether the conviction was upheld or set aside. Here is a summary of the text:

The accused, Muhammad Umar, was tried for the murder of his father-in-law, Abdul Sattar. The prosecution presented several witnesses, including the complainant, two eyewitnesses, and a police officer who investigated the case. The accused denied any involvement in the murder and claimed that he was falsely implicated by the complainant and the eyewitnesses, who were closely related to each other and had a motive to frame him. The accused also pointed out inconsistencies in the eyewitnesses' testimonies and argued that the police investigation was flawed.

The accused's lawyer argued that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused. The lawyer also questioned the credibility of the eyewitnesses, pointing out that they were closely related to the deceased and had a motive to frame the accused. The lawyer further argued that the accused had no reason to commit the murder and that the prosecution's case was based on weak evidence.

On the other hand, the prosecution argued that the accused had a motive to commit the murder and that the eyewitnesses' testimonies were credible. However, the text does not provide further details on the prosecution's argument. Here is a summary of the text:

The appeal is against the conviction of the appellant for the murder of Abdul Sattar. The prosecution's case is based on the eyewitness testimony of Tanveer Ahmad, the son of the deceased, and Ghulam Rasool, the real uncle of the complainant. The defense argued that the eyewitnesses are related and their testimony should not be relied upon, but the prosecution countered that the consistent narration of the events by the eyewitnesses and the prompt lodging of the FIR rule out the possibility of misidentification or manipulation.

The appeal was admitted to regular hearing, but the complainant failed to appear despite repeated notices. The court observed that the complainant has shown no interest in the appeal and has gone to Saudi Arabia.

The main arguments of the appeal are:

* The prompt lodging of the FIR does not guarantee that the appellant was not falsely involved.
* The prosecution's case relies heavily on the ocular account of the eyewitnesses, which is questionable.
* The medical evidence shows that the victim was shot from a distance of three feet, but one of the eyewitnesses claimed that the distance was 24 Karams (a large distance).
* The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.

The court is reviewing the evidence and considering the arguments of both sides to determine the outcome of the appeal. The text discusses the importance of consistency between medical evidence and eyewitness testimony in criminal cases, specifically in relation to gunshot wounds. The Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently ruled that if there is a conflict between the two, the medical evidence should be given more weight. In several cases, the Court has noted that eyewitnesses have reported distances of 30-35 feet between the shooter and the victim, but medical evidence has shown blackening and burning on the body, which is only possible if the shot was fired from a much closer range (around 3-4 feet). The Court has ruled that in such cases, the eyewitness testimony cannot be accepted to the extent that it is inconsistent with the medical evidence. This is based on established medical jurisprudence, which states that blackening on the body can only occur if the shot is fired from a close range. Here is a summary of the text:

The text discusses a criminal appeal case where the appellant, Muhammad Umar, is accused of murdering Abdul Sattar. The prosecution's case is being scrutinized for inconsistencies and doubts. The following points are highlighted:

* The autopsy report suggests that the bullet wounds on the deceased's body indicate that the assailant was on a higher level than the deceased, which contradicts the prosecution's claim.
* A witness, Tanveer Ahmad, testified that the distance between his father (the deceased) and the assailant was 2.5 karams (a unit of measurement) when the shot was fired, but did not inform the police about the incident.
* The police station was only 7 km away from the crime scene, but none of the witnesses, including Tanveer Ahmad and his brother-in-law, Ghulam Rasool, reported the matter to the police. Instead, someone else anonymously informed the police about the occurrence.
* There are discrepancies in the recording of the complaint by the investigating officer, Javed Ahmad SI, who initially stated that the complaint was recorded at the bridge Khaddar Canal 40/KB, but later corrected himself to say it was recorded at the crime scene.
* The prosecution's story is further doubted by the fact that the appellant, who lived in a nearby village, allegedly escaped on a motorbike, which seems abnormal.

Overall, the text highlights the inconsistencies and doubts in the prosecution's case, casting suspicion on the appellant's guilt. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellant's defense claims that the police planted a motorbike at the crime scene, which is questionable since the appellant and their co-accused were reportedly armed and fearless, making it unlikely that they would leave the motorbike behind. Additionally, the prosecution's claim that the appellant and co-accused fired shots in the air while escaping, but no empty cartridges were found, raises doubts about the prosecution's case.

The text also references a legal principle that the prosecution must prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle is rooted in history, dating back to medieval times when convicting an innocent person was considered a mortal sin. The standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt" was originally designed to protect the souls of jurors from damnation, rather than to make it more difficult to convict. Today, this principle remains, and the prosecution must prove its case to this standard.

The text also mentions the presumption of innocence, a legal principle that every person accused of a crime is innocent until proven guilty. Here's a summary of the passage:

In Pakistan's legal system, an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. To secure a conviction, the prosecution must present compelling evidence that proves the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Even if there is only one circumstance that raises doubt about the accused's guilt, the benefit of doubt must go to the accused as a matter of right, not concession or grace. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently held that:

* The prosecution's case must be based on firm evidence, not mere conjectures or probabilities.
* A single infirmity in the prosecution's case is enough to entitle the accused to the benefit of doubt.
* The benefit of doubt is a right, not a favor, and must be granted to the accused if there is any reasonable doubt about their guilt.
* It is better to let a guilty person go free than to punish an innocent person.
* Even a single circumstance that creates reasonable doubt is enough to grant the accused the benefit of doubt.

The passage cites several judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, including Muhammad Akram vs. The State, Muhammad Imran's case, and Najaf Ali Shah's case, to support these principles. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled in favor of the appellant, citing previous cases that establish the principle that if there is even a single loophole or inconsistency in the prosecution's case, the benefit of that loophole goes to the accused. In this case, the court found such a loophole and therefore:

* Set aside the impugned judgment dated 31.03.2015 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge
* Acquitted the appellant from the case
* Ordered the appellant's release from custody, provided they are not required in any other case.
