Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

* The Peshawar High Court is hearing a criminal appeal (No. 109-D/2019) filed by the State against the acquittal of Noroz Khan alias Abu Bakar, who was accused of murder and other charges.
* The case is related to an incident on September 15, 2014, where 15-20 armed men, including the accused, attacked the house of Azghar Khan, killing two brothers and injuring the complainant.
* The accused was identified by the complainant and others, and a FIR was filed. The investigation recovered various pieces of evidence, including blood-stained earth, bullets, empty shells, and clothes.
* The accused was arrested in 2019 and a supplementary challan was submitted against him. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.
* The prosecution examined 18 witnesses to prove its case, but the Anti-Terrorism Court, D.I Khan, acquitted the accused on October 9, 2019.
* The State has appealed against this acquittal, and the appeal is being heard by the Peshawar High Court. Here is a summary of the text:

* The prosecution presented its evidence, and the accused respondent pleaded innocence and claimed to be falsely implicated.
* The accused did not want to be examined under oath or present a defense, and the trial court acquitted him in 2019.
* The state appealed the acquittal, and the appeal is being heard.
* The case involves a violent incident at the complainant's house, where 15-20 armed men entered and fired on the complainant and his brothers, killing two of them.
* The key issue is whether the accused respondent was identified beyond reasonable doubt by the complainant and an eyewitness, Mst. Amina Bibi.
* The court has doubts about the complainant's testimony, citing inconsistencies in his statements, such as the number of people who entered the house and whether the accused respondent was known to him.
* The court also notes contradictions between the complainant's statement and that of Mst. Amina Bibi, including whether the accused had their faces covered.
* While the complainant's presence at the scene is not disputed, the court is cautious about relying solely on his testimony, citing a precedent from the apex court that a confirmed presence does not necessarily equate to truth. The text appears to be a legal judgment or ruling from a Pakistani court. Here's a summary:

The court is discussing the principles of evaluating evidence, particularly in relation to injured witnesses. It has been established that an injured witness's presence at the crime scene can be confirmed, but their testimony should not be taken as gospel truth and must be assessed like any other prosecution witness. The court cites several previous cases to support this view.

In the specific case being discussed, the prosecution's witnesses, including the complainant and another witness, Saif ur Rehman, have inconsistencies in their testimonies. The complainant, who was injured, admitted that she did not know the accused before the incident and therefore could not have identified him. Saif ur Rehman's testimony contradicts the complainant's statement, and the court finds that his testimony is not reliable.

Furthermore, the complainant's statement is also questionable because he claimed to have lodged a report at the hospital, but the doctor's testimony suggests that the complainant was in a serious condition and unable to speak at the time. Additionally, the complainant did not provide a description of the accused in his initial report, and no identification parade was conducted.

The court concludes that the prosecution's case is weak and that the complainant's statements are not credible enough to convict the accused of a capital offense. The respondent-accused is facing a capital charge of double murder and the prosecution's case is weak due to lack of corroborating evidence from an unimpeachable source. The prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and if any doubt is created, the benefit goes to the accused. The principle of criminal justice is that a single reasonable doubt is sufficient for acquittal.

In an appeal against acquittal, the scope of interference is limited and the courts should be slow to interfere with an acquittal judgment unless it is shown to be perverse, based on a gross violation of law, or suffers from grave errors of mis-reading or non-reading of the evidence.

The Supreme Court has ruled that in an appeal against acquittal, the court will not ordinarily interfere with the findings of the lower court, and will give due weight and consideration to the acquittal judgment. The approach is different from an appeal against conviction, where the court will re-appraise the evidence to extend the benefit of every reasonable doubt to the accused.

The acquittal judgment carries two presumptions: (1) the accused is innocent until proven guilty, and (2) the lower court's confirmation of the assumption of innocence. The acquittal will not be disturbed unless the lower court has disregarded material evidence, misread it, or received it illegally.

In summary, the prosecution's case is weak, and the respondent-accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. The appeal against acquittal should be dismissed, and the acquittal judgment should be upheld. The text summarizes the principles guiding the interference of a higher court with an acquittal order passed by a lower court. According to the Supreme Court, interference with an acquittal order should be exceptional and only in cases where the acquittal is found to be "wholly artificial, shocking, and ridiculous" or where there is "overwhelming proof" that the lower court misread the evidence. The Supreme Court has also emphasized that when examining an acquittal order, the court must be cautious and not set aside the order merely because another view is possible. The interference should be limited to cases where there is grave miscarriage of justice.

In the present case, the court has relied on various case laws, including "Mst. Jallan Vs. Muhammad Riaz and others" (PLD 2003 SC 644), which states that once an accused has been acquitted, they enjoy a double presumption of innocence, and the court should be careful and cautious in interfering with the acquittal order.

Based on these principles, the court has upheld the acquittal of the respondents-accused, dismissing the appeal.
