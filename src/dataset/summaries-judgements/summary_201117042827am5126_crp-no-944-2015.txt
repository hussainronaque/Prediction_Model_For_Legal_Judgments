Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissed a criminal petition (No. 944 of 2015) filed by Danish against the State and others. The petition was against an order dated 23.11.2015 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in Criminal Miscellaneous B.A. No. 1878-P of 2015.

The Supreme Court judges, after hearing the petitioner's counsel and reviewing the record, found that the High Court's decision to grant post-arrest bail to respondent No. 2 was based on the fact that he had a prima facie established alibi, with official records showing that he was out of the country on the date of the incident.

The Supreme Court did not find any reason to interfere with the High Court's decision and dismissed the petition, refusing leave to appeal. The judges also made an observation that the High Court's order granting bail was unnecessarily lengthy (12 typed pages) and recommended that in the future, the High Court should follow the Supreme Court's judgment in the case of Muhammad Shakeel v. The State and others (PLD 2014 SC 458).
