Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has issued a judgment in two civil petitions (Nos. 1885 and 2259 of 2017) filed against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated 30.03.2017.

The petitions were filed by Olas Khan and Sahibzada Alamgir, who were accused of offences under the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Ordinance, 1999. Olas Khan was denied bail by the High Court, while Sahibzada Alamgir was granted bail.

The Supreme Court has dismissed both petitions, upholding the judgment of the High Court. The Court has held that the High Court has no jurisdiction to grant bail to an accused person under the NAB Ordinance, 1999, as all offences under the Ordinance are non-bailable.

The judgment was given by a two-member bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Mr. Justice Ejaz Afzal Khan and Mr. Justice Mushir Alam. The court has also ordered that the judgments be sent to the Peshawar High Court and the National Accountability Bureau for necessary action. Here is a summary of the text:

The text discusses the jurisdiction of the High Court and Accountability Court in granting bail to individuals facing charges under the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance (NAO) of 1999. The Supreme Court has previously held in several cases (Mrs. Shahida Faisal, Anwer Saifullah Khan) that both courts have jurisdiction to grant bail in such cases. However, Section 9(b) of the NAO initially stated that all offences under the Ordinance were non-bailable and that no court, including the High Court, had jurisdiction to grant bail. This provision was later amended.

The Supreme Court has clarified that despite Section 9(b), the High Court's power to grant bail under Article 199 of the Constitution remains available and is not restricted by any legislative instruction or statute. This means that the High Court can still grant bail in NAO cases, notwithstanding the provisions of the Ordinance. Here is a summary of the text:

The National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) 1999 was amended in 2001, specifically Section 9(b), where the words "including High Court" were omitted. The amended provision states that all offenses under the Order are non-bailable and no court, including the High Court, has jurisdiction to grant bail to a person accused of an offense under the Order.

However, despite the omission of the words "including High Court", the High Court still has jurisdiction to grant bail in NAO cases under Article 199 of the Constitution, as held in various court cases. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has consistently held that the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 199 cannot be taken away by legislative enactment, and that the High Court can grant bail in NAO cases in appropriate circumstances.

The court has also clarified that the discretion of the High Court under the Constitution and under ordinary law in bail matters is based on the same principles, and that the refusal of bail by the High Court solely because of the wording of the amended provision is not proper. The summary is about the implications of Section 9(b) of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Ordinance, 1999, as amended, on the grant of bail in cases under the Ordinance.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that despite the amendment, the legal position regarding the maintainability of a bail application under Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) before the High Court in cases under the NAB Ordinance, 1999 remains unchanged. This means that an accused of an offence under the NAB Ordinance, 1999 can still file a bail application before the High Court under Section 497, Cr.P.C.

The Court has further clarified that the High Court's power to grant bail in writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973 is not affected by the amendment to Section 9(b) of the NAB Ordinance, 1999. In other words, the High Court can still grant bail in cases under the NAB Ordinance, 1999, exercising its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution.

The Court has also rejected the contention of the NAB that the jurisdiction of the High Court to grant bail is concurrent with the trial court, and that the ouster of jurisdiction of the Accountability Court also ousts the jurisdiction of the High Court. The Court has held that the Accountability Court has no jurisdiction to grant pre-arrest or post-arrest bail, and that the Superior Courts can exercise their jurisdiction under Article 199 and 184 of the Constitution, respectively, to consider and grant bail in cases under the NAB Ordinance, 1999. The text discusses a legal case involving the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Peshawar High Court in Pakistan. Here's a summary:

* The Peshawar High Court granted bail to a respondent, Sahibzada, under Section 497 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) in a case filed by NAB.
* The NAB has challenged this decision, arguing that the High Court did not have the jurisdiction to grant bail under Section 497 Cr.P.C.
* The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ruled that although the High Court assumed jurisdiction under the wrong provision of law, this error does not automatically invalidate the decision.
* The High Court has the power to grant bail in NAB cases under Article 199 of the Constitution, as previously established by the Supreme Court in various cases.
* The NAB had argued that the High Court's decision was influenced by a misconstrued reading of Section 17 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, which makes certain provisions of the Cr.P.C. applicable to NAB cases.
* The Supreme Court has clarified that Section 17(c) of the NAO, 1999 gives the Accountability Court the authority to dispense with or invoke certain provisions of the Cr.P.C., but this power must be exercised judiciously and with sound reasons.
* The Supreme Court has also referred to previous judgments that establish the High Court's jurisdiction to grant bail in NAB cases and regulate pre-arrest and post-arrest bail.

In summary, the Supreme Court has upheld the Peshawar High Court's decision to grant bail to Sahibzada, despite the High Court's error in assuming jurisdiction under the wrong provision of law. The Supreme Court has reiterated the High Court's powers to grant bail in NAB cases and clarified the interpretation of Section 17(c) of the NAO, 1999. Here's a summary of the case:

Olas Khan, the petitioner, was the Director General of Farm Water Management and Provincial Project Director for a project on "Conservation and Productivity Enhancement through High Efficiency Irrigation System" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. He was accused of embezzlement and corruption in the project, including releasing funds for non-functional schemes and not ensuring the 20% farmers' share. An investigation report found that out of 182 schemes, only 6 were functional, resulting in a waste of national resources.

The Peshawar High Court denied Olas Khan's bail petition, citing sufficient documentary evidence against him and his involvement in corrupt practices. The court said that he did not deserve bail at this stage.

Olas Khan's lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the project was devolved to the province after the 18th Constitutional Amendment in 2011, and Olas Khan had retired from service in 2013, so he was no longer responsible for the alleged corruption. The lawyer also cited previous judgments and reports that supported Olas Khan's claim of innocence. However, the Peshawar High Court declined bail, citing the available record and evidence against Olas Khan. Here is a summary of the letter dated May 22, 2013:

The letter is a court document related to a case involving corruption and corrupt practices in a project. The project's director, the petitioner, is accused of corruption and is seeking bail. The petitioner's lawyer argues that the case is suitable for bail, citing proceedings in a High Court case that do not relate to the petitioner's conduct. The prosecutor, however, disputes this claim, pointing out that the petitioner's actions as director and project director are relevant to the case. The prosecutor presents evidence, including work orders and cheques issued without proper compliance, to support the accusation of corruption.

The court reviews the evidence and arguments, noting that the original project was effective from 2007 to 2011, and the petitioner retired in 2013. The court concludes that the corruption allegations pertain to a period prior to the project's devolution to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the petitioner's retirement. The court rejects the petitioner's bail application, finding that the evidence and allegations against the petitioner are relevant to the case and do not support his claim for bail. Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissed Civil Petition No. 2259 of 2017, which sought to cancel the bail granted to Saibzada Alamgir, a respondent in a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) case. The bail was granted by the Peshawar High Court, and the NAB appealed to the Supreme Court to cancel the bail. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, finding that the grounds for cancellation of bail were different from those for granting bail, and that the NAB did not show any extraordinary circumstances to warrant recall of the bail order. The court also noted that the inquiry against the accused had been completed and he had only been charged with connivance, with no direct allegations against him. Therefore, the petition was dismissed and leave was declined.
