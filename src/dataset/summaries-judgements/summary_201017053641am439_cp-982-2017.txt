This is a formal legal document from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Islamabad, dated July 14, 2018. It appears to be a notification of a court order dismissing a criminal petition (No. 982 of 2017) as "not pressed" by the petitioners.

Here are the key details:

* The petition was filed by Riaz and others against Arbab Tehsin Ullah and others, appealing a judgment/order of the Peshawar High Court dated July 28, 2017, in case FIR No.895/1991.
* The Supreme Court, in its order dated June 19, 2018, dismissed the petition as not pressed, as the petitioners' lawyer stated that they would pursue a remedy in the Civil Court for a monetary claim related to the case.
* The lawyer also stated that any findings by the High Court on the merits of the case would not affect their claim, which would be decided according to the law.

The document includes a certified copy of the order/judgment, and requests acknowledgement of receipt from the Peshawar High Court.
