Here is a summary of the document:

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has dismissed a criminal petition (No. 1106 of 2017) filed by Ali Yar Khan against Sher Ali and another respondent. The petition was an appeal against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court dated September 20, 2017, in a case related to a murder that took place in 2010.

The Supreme Court judges, including Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Justice Dost Muhammad Khan, and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, heard the petition and dismissed it on February 23, 2018. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against the respondent beyond reasonable doubt, and agreed with the High Court's conclusion that the evidence presented was not sufficient to convict the respondent.

The court's order highlights several weaknesses in the prosecution's case, including:

* The post-mortem examination of the deceased was conducted 40 minutes before the FIR was registered, which casts doubt on the credibility of the FIR and the complainant's account.
* The eyewitnesses were related to the deceased and lived far away from the place of occurrence.
* No independent eyewitnesses were produced, and no motive for the crime was established.
* No weapon was recovered from the respondent's custody.

The Supreme Court therefore dismissed the petition and refused to grant leave to appeal.
