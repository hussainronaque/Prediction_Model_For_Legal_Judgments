This is a court document from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. It appears to be a judgment in two connected criminal petitions (Nos. 113-P and 114-P of 2015) that were filed against an order of the Peshawar High Court dated 02/06/2015.

The petitions were filed by Zubair Khan and Hasham Ali, who were convicted by the trial court in 2012 for murder and other related offenses. They were sentenced to imprisonment for life and fined. They appealed against their conviction to the Peshawar High Court, but their appeal was dismissed.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan has now dismissed the criminal petitions filed by Zubair Khan and Hasham Ali, upholding their conviction and sentence. The court heard arguments from the counsel for the petitioners, the counsel for the son of one of the deceased victims, and the Additional Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The court's order is brief and does not provide detailed reasons for dismissing the petitions. It simply states that the petitions are dismissed in terms of the order stated therein, and directs the Registrar of the Peshawar High Court to take necessary action. Here is a summary of the text:

The prosecution has proved its case against the petitioner beyond a reasonable doubt in a murder case that took place on December 28, 2009. The complainant, Muhammad Din, reported the incident to the police within 30 minutes, which suggests that there was no deliberation or consultation. The prosecution only produced one witness, Muhammad Din, but the court finds that the quality of evidence is more important than the quantity. The witness's testimony is consistent and inspires confidence. Although another eyewitness, PW Asif, was not produced, the court accepts the explanation that he was afraid to testify after another eyewitness was killed by the petitioner's side during the trial. The medical evidence supports the prosecution's case, showing that the victims died from firearm injuries. The court rejects the petitioner's argument that the positive report of the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) is irrelevant because the petitioner was acquitted in a separate trial under the Arms Act. The court finds that the prosecution has proved its case through direct evidence and medical evidence, and that the motive for the crime was a property dispute. Here is a summary of the court document:

**Case 1: Cri. Petition No. 114-P of 2015**

The petitioner's appeal is dismissed as there is no independent witness to prove the allegations made by the complainant, Muhammad Din. The prosecution failed to prove their motive, and the sentence of imprisonment for life on two counts is affirmed as meeting the ends of justice.

**Case 2: Cri. Petition No. 113-P of 2015**

The petitioner, the son of the deceased Mehar Din, seeks to enhance the sentence of respondent No.1. However, the petition is barred by time, and the grounds for condonation of delay are not valid. Additionally, the sentence of imprisonment for life on two counts is deemed sufficient, and no interference with the impugned judgment is called for. The petition is dismissed on both procedural and merits-based grounds.
