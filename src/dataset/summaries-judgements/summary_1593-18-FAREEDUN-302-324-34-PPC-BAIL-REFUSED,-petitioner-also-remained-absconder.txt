Here is a summary of the judgment sheet:

* The petitioner, Fareedun son of Zarif Khan, is seeking bail in a murder case (crime no. 1079) registered in 1999.
* The petitioner is accused of murdering Abdullah Jan and attempting to kill two others.
* The petitioner's lawyer argues that the complainant has submitted an affidavit stating that the petitioner was falsely accused, and therefore, the case requires further investigation.
* The State's lawyer counters that the affidavit's evidentiary value should be assessed during the trial, and that the petitioner remained at large for 18 years, which is a significant factor against granting bail.
* The daughter of the deceased, Mst. Ishrat, appears in person and claims that the complainant had compromised with the petitioner after receiving money, making the affidavit unreliable.
* The court denies bail to the petitioner, citing his 18-year abscondence as a significant factor, and notes that the post-mortem report supports the prosecution's case.
* The court also notes that the affidavit's evidentiary value will be decided by the trial court, and that the petitioner's lawyer's argument that the complainant had falsely accused him is not sufficient to grant bail. Here is a summary of the case:

The court has dismissed a petition for bail due to lack of merit. The reason for the dismissal is that the trial has already commenced and the supreme court has established the principle that bail applications should not be considered on merits once the trial has begun, as it may prejudice the case for either side. The court cites several previous cases to support this principle. The trial court has been directed to conclude the trial expeditiously and the record has been sent back to the trial court.
