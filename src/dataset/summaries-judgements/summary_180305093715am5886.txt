This is a judgment sheet from the Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench in Swat, Pakistan. The case involves an appeal by two brothers, Muhammadullah and Hanifullah, who were convicted of double murder by the Additional Sessions Judge/Izafi Zilla Qazi-VI, Swat.

The brothers were found guilty of murdering their sister-in-law, Mst. Bachazul Bakht, and her alleged paramour, Lal Muhammad, on the night of February 14-15, 2012. The appellants claimed that they committed the murders because they caught the two in a compromising position and they were outraged by their illicit relationship.

The first information report was filed by Muhammadullah, who stated that he had been watching his sister-in-law and Lal Muhammad due to suspicion of their illicit relationship. He broke into the room where they were together and attacked them with an axe and knife, resulting in their deaths.

The appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs.200,000 each to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased. They were also given the option to undergo six months' imprisonment in case of default of payment.

The appeal was heard by Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, who heard arguments from the appellants' advocate, Mr. Sher Muhammad Khan, and the respondents' advocates, Sahibzada Bahauddin and Mr. Fazli Ghafoor. The judgment was announced on February 20, 2018. Here is a summary of the text:

A police investigation was conducted into a double murder case. The informant was arrested and their blood-stained clothing and shoes were seized as evidence. The police also took photographs of the informant. The investigation team collected various pieces of evidence from the crime scene, including:

* Injury sheets and inquest reports for the two deceased individuals, Mst. Bachazul Bakht and Lal Muhammad
* A site plan prepared by the appellant Muhammadullah
* Blood-stained earth and cotton from the area where the bodies were found
* A crime-scene empty cartridge and axe and knife presented by the appellant Hanifullah
* A broken door and a 100-watt bulb from the room where the bodies were found

The bodies were shifted to the hospital for post-mortem examination. The doctor's report (PW-5) described the external and internal injuries on Lal Muhammad's body, including lacerated wounds to the head, a firearm injury to the throat, and incised wounds to the chin and buttock. The cause of death was determined to be damage to the brain and blood loss shock. The time between injury and death was unknown, but the time between death and post-mortem was estimated to be 10-14 hours. The report appears to be a summary of a court case involving two appellants, Muhammadullah and Hanifullah, who are accused of murdering two individuals, Lal Muhammad and Bachazul Bakht.

The report includes the following key points:

* A post-mortem examination was conducted by Lady Dr. Salma, who observed that the bodies had suffered injuries, including incised wounds to the head, fracture of the right index finger, and stick marks on the back.
* The report also mentions that vaginal swabs were taken from the female victim and sent to a forensic lab for investigation.
* The police recovered various pieces of evidence, including blood-stained garments, a Kalashnikov rifle, and an axe and knife, which were sent for forensic examination.
* The forensic reports confirmed that the blood-stained garments and weapons had human blood and semen on them.
* The appellants were arrested and interrogated, and one of them, Muhammadullah, disclosed that he had handed over the crime weapon to his brother Hanifullah.
* Two witnesses, Sahib Zada and Ismail, recorded statements under Section 164 of the Cr.P.C, which implicated the appellants in the murders. They alleged that the appellants had committed the murders over a dispute regarding the boundary of land.

Based on the evidence and statements, the prosecution presented its case, and the appellants were tried in court. The report mentions that the prosecution examined 10 witnesses in total. Here is a summary of the text:

The appellants, Muhammadullah and Hanifullah, were convicted and sentenced by a trial court for an unspecified crime. They appealed the decision, arguing that the prosecution's case was weak and relied on circumstantial evidence. The appellants' lawyer argued that:

1. The First Information Report (FIR) was not a valid piece of evidence as it was not proved in court by its maker, and the appellants were not given the opportunity to cross-examine the maker.
2. The FIR was lodged 13-14 days after the occurrence, which was a fatal delay that made the prosecution's case suspicious.
3. The recovery of the dead bodies from the appellants' brother's house was not sufficient evidence to convict them.
4. The recovery of a Kalashnikov rifle on the alleged pointation of one of the appellants was doubtful.
5. There were discrepancies between the medical report of the deceased and the FIR, which negated the prosecution's version.
6. The extra-judicial confession introduced by the prosecution was not admissible evidence and required corroboration from another source.
7. The occurrence was unwitnessed, and the trial court failed to analyze the circumstantial evidence with due care and caution.

The appellants' lawyer argued that the trial court's judgment was based on a wrong appreciation of the evidence and requested that the appellants be acquitted. The lawyer cited several judgments from the Supreme Court in support of their arguments. This appears to be a judgment or decision in a criminal appeal case in Pakistan. Here's a summary:

* The appeal is against a lower court's conviction of two appellants, Muhammadullah and another, for double murder.
* The defense argues that the first information report (FIR) made by the accused as complainant is not admissible as evidence against them, citing discrepancies between the FIR and medical report.
* The prosecution and respondent no. 2 argue that the FIR is a public document and admissible in evidence without further proof. They contend that the FIR is meant to set the law in motion and does not require all details, and that the prosecution story in the FIR should be believed or disbelieved as a whole.
* The prosecution also argues that the FIR has evidentiary value and can be used for contradiction and corroboration purposes. They cite various Pakistani court judgments to support their position.
* The prosecution submits that the appellants' common intention can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case, and that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
* The appellants' conviction is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed.

The judgment references various Pakistani laws and court judgments, including the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984, and several Supreme Court and High Court decisions. Here is a summary of the text:

The case revolves around whether a First Information Report (FIR) lodged by an accused person can be used as evidence against them. The prosecution claims that the appellant, Muhammadullah, committed murder and then went to the police station to admit his guilt by making a report of the occurrence. However, the court questions the authenticity of the FIR, noting that Muhammadullah was produced before a judicial magistrate and refused to confess his guilt. The court argues that if Muhammadullah had voluntarily confessed to the crime, there would be no need for further custody or a request to record a judicial confession.

The court cites Article 38 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which states that a confession made to a police officer is not admissible as evidence against the accused. Therefore, the FIR lodged by Muhammadullah cannot be considered as evidence against him. The court also notes that the FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence unless its contents are affirmed on oath and the maker is subjected to cross-examination. The court will later discuss the evidentiary value of the last seen evidence in the case. Here is a summary of the text:

The document discusses the admissibility of First Information Reports (FIRs) as evidence in criminal cases in Pakistan. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has held that an FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence and can only be used to corroborate or contradict the statement of the maker, not as evidence against the maker at trial. An FIR is a previous statement of the accused that can be used to contradict its maker, but it must be proved in accordance with the law. The document cites various court cases, including "Muhammad Saleh Vs. The State" and "Muhammad Bakhsh Vs. The State", to support the argument that an FIR is not admissible as evidence unless the maker confirms its contents in court. The document also notes that an FIR can only be used to set the law in motion for conducting an investigation and is not a substantive piece of evidence by itself. Additionally, the document references the concept of "dying declaration", where an FIR made by a person near death can be admissible as evidence under certain principles. Overall, the document emphasizes that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and an FIR alone is not sufficient to do so. The judgment concludes that the First Information Report (FIR) lodged by Tajamnuyes cannot be used as evidence against the appellant Muhammadullah due to the prevailing circumstances of the case. The trial court's reliance on the FIR was unjustified.

The counsel for the complainant argued that the FIR can be used as an admission against a person, citing a Supreme Court judgment in "Muhammad Khan Vs. Dost Muhammad and 17 others" (PLD 1975 SC 607). However, the court distinguished this judgment, noting that the facts and circumstances of the present case are different. In the referred judgment, there was a cross-version of the case, and the report was lodged by the convict earlier in time, which is not the situation in this case.

The court held that the FIR cannot be used as evidence against Muhammadullah, and it would be illegal to do so. Furthermore, the FIR cannot be used against the co-appellant Hanifullah, as he was not nominated in the FIR and was charged by the relatives of the deceased in their statements recorded at a later stage. Here's a summary of the text:

A court case involves the murder of Lal Muhammad, whose father Sahib Zada (PW-1) and brother Ismail (PW-2) testified against the appellants, Muhammadullah and another. The murder occurred on February 15, 2012, but the witnesses' statements were not recorded until February 28, 2012, with no explanation for the delay. The court finds this delay problematic and cites previous judgments, including "Rahat Ali Vs. The State" and "Muhammad Asif Vs. The State", which state that such delays can affect the credibility of witnesses and make their statements unreliable. Therefore, the court concludes that the witnesses' statements cannot be safely relied upon to convict the appellants. The text appears to be a legal document or judgment from an appellate court. The court is reviewing a lower court's conviction of two appellants, Hanifullah and Muhammadullah, and is critiquing the prosecution's case. The main points can be summarized as follows:

* The prosecution's key witnesses, PW-1 Sahib Zada, did not report the incident for 13-14 days, which is an unexplained delay that raises doubts about their testimony.
* The witnesses' statements were recorded with no explanation for the delay, which goes against established legal principles.
* PW-1's testimony introduces a motive for the crime, but the story seems implausible and ridiculous.
* The court cites several precedents, including a Supreme Court judgment, that emphasize the importance of quick reporting and corroboration of last seen evidence.
* In this case, the last seen evidence was not reported in a timely manner and lacks corroboration from an unimpeachable source, making it unreliable.
* The story presented in the First Information Report (F.LR) also appears to be flawed and does not stand to reason.

Overall, the court is questioning the reliability of the prosecution's evidence and the trial court's decision to convict the appellants. The court is questioning the prosecution's case against the appellants, Muhammadullah and Hanifullah, who are accused of murder. The court points out several inconsistencies and weaknesses in the prosecution's case:

1. The FIR (First Information Report) does not explain why the appellant waited for 3.5 hours in the cold before breaking the door with an axe.
2. The post-mortem report of the deceased, Lal Muhammad, reveals firearm injuries, but there is no mention of firearms in the FIR.
3. The prosecution claims that the appellant's dress and boots were stained with blood, but the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) report only confirms the presence of human blood, without matching it to the deceased's blood group.
4. The court notes that even if the appellant's dress was stained with the deceased's blood, it could have happened when he lifted the dead bodies after the occurrence, rather than during the murder.
5. The occurrence is unwitnessed, and the last seen evidence has been disbelieved by the court.
6. The circumstantial evidence is also insufficient to prove the appellants' guilt, as the prosecution has failed to provide an unbroken chain of evidence.
7. The recovery of the axe, knife, and Kalashnikov from the appellants' brother's house is not enough to prove their involvement in the murder.
8. The court criticizes the investigation, noting that all the marginal witnesses to the recovery memos are police officials, and no private witnesses were involved.

The court concludes that the prosecution's case is doubtful and ambiguous, and that the appellants' guilt has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Here is a summary of the court judgment:

The court is reviewing a case (Cr.A No. 21-M of 2014) where Muhammadullah and another person are accused of murder. The court is critical of the police investigation, calling it "mechanical" and suggesting that the FIR (First Information Report) may have been fabricated or obtained through coercion or exploiting the appellant's illiteracy. The court finds that the prosecution's case relies on weak circumstantial evidence, with many missing links in the chain of evidence.

The court references a previous case, Fayyaz Ahmad (2017 SCMR 2026), which held that circumstantial evidence must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that all links in the chain of evidence are present and unbroken. In this case, many links are missing, and the court is not convinced of the appellants' guilt.

The court emphasizes the importance of careful evaluation of circumstantial evidence, as fabricating such evidence is not uncommon. The prosecution must establish the case beyond all reasonable doubt, and the court must be satisfied that the evidence is reliable and not manipulated.

In this case, the court finds that the FIR is based on an inadmissible statement by the appellant, and there are several inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence, including the failure to mention firearms in the FIR, the lack of independent witnesses, and the dubious recovery of a Kalashnikov rifle. Therefore, the court is not convinced of the appellants' guilt and is reluctant to rely on the prosecution's evidence. The text appears to be a legal judgment or analysis of a court case, and it discusses the following points:

* The importance of appreciating evidence in a criminal case, citing a previous judgment in "Muhammadullah Vs. The State" (PLD 2001 Peshawar 132).
* In that case, the court held that a First Information Report (FIR) based on the accused's statement to the police is inadmissible as evidence, and that the discovery of a dead body at the instance of the accused only proves the accused's knowledge of the crime scene.
* The court also held that the recovery of a shotgun and empties from the accused's possession and the crime scene, as well as a positive ballistic report, only proves the use of the shotgun in the crime, but not that the accused used it to commit the crime.
* The judgment notes that necessary witnesses were not examined, and the motive for the crime appears to be false and fictional.
* The court ultimately acquitted the accused due to lack of direct or circumstantial evidence connecting them to the crime.
* The judgment also cites another case, "Muhammad Jamshed and another Vs. The State and others" (2016 SCMR 1019), which held that suspicion, no matter how strong, cannot substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal case.

In summary, the text emphasizes the importance of appreciating evidence in criminal cases and the need for concrete proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It also highlights the limitations of certain types of evidence, such as confessions and circumstantial evidence, and the dangers of relying on speculation or suspicion in criminal trials. Here is a summary of the criminal case:

The appellant (defendant) was accused of murder, specifically an "honor killing", and was convicted by the lower courts. However, the Supreme Court has overturned the conviction, citing a lack of evidence and improper consideration of the case by the lower courts. The Court noted that:

* The role of the appellant in the incident was unknown and never disclosed by the prosecution
* The circumstances of the deceased's death were also unknown
* The prosecution failed to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt
* The lower courts erred in convicting the appellant without properly appraising the evidence
* The Court should not apply a different standard of evidence appraisal for "honor killing" cases, but rather follow established principles of evidence appraisal.

As a result, the appeal was allowed, the conviction was set aside, and the appellants were acquitted of the charge and ordered to be released from jail if not required in any other case.
