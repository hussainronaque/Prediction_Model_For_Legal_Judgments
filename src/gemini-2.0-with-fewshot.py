    """
    Extract Crime Scenario, Witnesses, Counsel Statements, and Judgment with inferred counsel statements if not explicit.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    You are a legal assistant. Your task is to analyze a legal judgment and extract key information in a structured format. Below are examples of judgments and their extracted details to guide you. Use these to understand how to extract: (1) Crime Scenario, (2) Witnesses, (3) Prosecution Counsel Statement, (4) Defense Counsel Statement, and (5) Judgment. For counsel statements, if not explicitly provided, infer plausible arguments based on the trial outcome, appeal reasoning, and court findings, ensuring they align with the text’s context.

    ### Example 1: Cr.A No. 5-M/2014
    **Input:** Judgment from Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench. Appellants Noor Rehman and Dilawar convicted of murdering Mst. Bakhtia (FIR No. 359, 2011) under sections 302(b), 322, 34 PPC and 13 AO. Trial court sentenced them to life imprisonment and fines. Appeal argued a pre-2016 compromise with the deceased’s heirs, allowed as the honor killing law barring compromise came later. Court accepted the compromise, acquitted appellants of murder charges, reduced Dilawar’s 13 AO sentence to time served.
    **Output:**
    - **Crime Scenario:** On 16.07.2011, in Anghapur, Tehsil Daggar, District Buner, Mst. Bakhtia, aged 24/25, was found slaughtered in Noor Rehman’s house by SHO Muhammad Irshad Khan. Complainant Hazrat Rehman reported his sister Bakhtia, married to Abdur Rehman (in Malaysia), lived with Noor Rehman (brother-in-law) and was killed by Noor Rehman and Dilawar, who suspected her of immoral character. Charged under sections 302(b), 322, 34 PPC, and 13 AO.
    - **Witnesses:** PW-5 Hazrat Rehman (complainant, reported murder); PW-6 Muhammad Irshad Khan (SHO, found body); PW-7 Sher Muhammad Khan (recovered weapons); PW-8 Balezar Khan (initial investigator, collected blood). Ten witnesses total, key ones listed.
    - **Prosecution Counsel Statement:** Likely argued that the appellants’ guilt was proven by eyewitness testimony, recovered weapons, and confessions, justifying the life imprisonment for an honor-based murder.
    - **Defense Counsel Statement:** Argued that a pre-2016 compromise with the deceased’s heirs was legally valid, as the 2016 honor killing law barring compromise did not apply retrospectively, seeking acquittal.
    - **Judgment:** Sections 302(b), 322, 34 PPC, and 13 AO applied. Court accepted the compromise (pre-2016 law), acquitted appellants of murder charges, reduced Dilawar’s 13 AO sentence to time served (24.09.2020), citing no retrospective effect of the 2016 Amendment Act.

    ### Example 2: Cr.A No. 56-M/2022
    **Input:** Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench, heard Cr.A No. 56-M/2022. Appellant Said Afzal convicted under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013, for possessing an unlicensed Kalashnikov, sentenced to three years RI and fine. Appeal highlighted weak evidence: unproduced case property, unreliable witness testimony, and a flawed confession. Court found prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond doubt, acquitted appellant.
    **Output:**
    - **Crime Scenario:** On an unspecified date in Tehsil Warri, District Dir Upper, Inspector Attaullah Khan (SHO) acted on spy information that Said Afzal and Naseeb Rawan, proclaimed offenders, were at their house armed with Kalashnikovs. During a police raid, both were arrested after fleeing, each with a Kalashnikov, magazines, and rounds. Charged under section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013.
    - **Witnesses:** PW-1 Armourer Wajid Ullah (examined weapon); PW-3 Constable Iqbal (recovery witness); PW-4 ASI Ziaullah (received case property); PW-5 ASI Samiullah (testified); PW-6 Ali Khan (private witness, did not support recovery); PW-7 Inspector Attaullah (seizing officer); PW-8 Constable Rahman Uddin (recovery witness); PW-9 Judicial Magistrate (recorded confession). Nine witnesses total.
    - **Prosecution Counsel Statement:**  Contended that recovery of the Kalashnikov, supported by police witnesses and a confession, sufficiently proved illegal possession, warranting conviction.
    - **Defense Counsel Statement:** Argued the prosecution’s case was flawed due to unproduced case property, unreliable witness testimony (e.g., PW-6), and a procedurally defective confession, seeking acquittal.
    - **Judgment:** Section 15 KP Arms Act, 2013 applied. Court acquitted Said Afzal (14.02.2023), finding evidence insufficient (unproduced property, doubtful confession, witness contradictions), applying the benefit of doubt.

    **Task:** Analyze the following legal judgment text and extract the information in this exact format:
    Input: {text}

    Extract and structure the information:
    - **Crime Scenario:** [Complete description of events, including what happened, how, when, who was involved, and charges.]
    - **Witnesses:** [List all witnesses and summarize their testimonies, including all PWs. If no witnesses are mentioned, state "No witnesses mentioned."]
    - **Prosecution Counsel Statement:** [Summarize key arguments; infer from trial outcome]
    - **Defense Counsel Statement:** [Summarize key arguments; infer from appeal reasoning if not explicit.]
    - **Judgment:** [Section of law, verdict, findings, sentencing, and basis of decision.]

    GUIDELINES:
    - For counsel statements not explicitly stated in the text: If you can reasonably infer from context, provide a brief logical inference based ONLY on information in the text. If inference isn't possible, use "No explicit statement provided in the text."
    - If no witnesses are mentioned, use "No witnesses mentioned in the text."
    - Do NOT invent facts, dates, names, or details not presented or reasonably implied in the text.
    - If the case involves narcotics, drugs, or chars, return an OFF TOPIC IN A JSON object: {{}}
    - For each section, extract ALL relevant information from the text.
